Yue Yiren

25
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,984
is drowning
in the lengthy project report.

26
00:01:58,504 --> 00:01:59,784
The sunlight is dazzling.

27
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:02,304
She holds up a book by hand to block it

28
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,024
and suddenly remembers

29
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,984
how Song Ming smiled at her in the sun

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,664
when they went

31
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:08,904
to the seaside for vacation.

32
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,944
(What else do you want to do)

33
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:12,664
(on the last day of the holiday?)

34
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,904
(Lying on the beach,)

35
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:16,544
(Yue Yiren reached over.)

36
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:18,464
I want to go home with you.

37
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:19,504
Okay.

38
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:20,984
Let's go home.

39
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:22,304
Just the two of us.

40
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:24,664
Yue Yiren pulled herself back
from the memory.

41
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:25,744
She lowers her head

42
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:28,104
(and goes on forcing those dull texts)

43
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,504
(into her head.)

44
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:30,864
(She knows)

45
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:32,664
(that they are thinking
about each other)

46
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,384
(although they cannot meet for now.)

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,024
(They are both trying)

48
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:39,424
(to be better for the reunion.)

49
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:47,424
Why are you here so early today?

50
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:50,744
I wanted to finish work faster

51
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:51,744
and pick you up.

52
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:53,904
By the way,

53
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,104
I'm listening to

54
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,624
that audiobook called

55
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:57,264
Lovely Moonlight.

56
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:58,384
Amazing.

57
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:00,584
It's because of your boyfriend.

58
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:01,304
Let's go.

59
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:11,696
=Episode 16=
(Love Is Not About Moving Oneself)

60
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:16,424
Mind the steps.

61
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:20,744
Morning.

62
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:24,664
From now on,
I'll only play games with him.

63
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:27,744
From now on,
I'll only play games with her.

64
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:29,264
You're into the office romance!

65
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:30,104
So what?

66
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:33,184
I sensed something between you
a long time ago.

67
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,904
Why haven't I sensed anything?

68
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:38,744
What can you possibly sense?

69
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:40,184
Well, Mengyao,

70
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:40,904
Mr. Hu.

71
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:42,824
Since you're in a relationship,

72
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:43,864
shouldn't you

73
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:44,984
treat the single ones

74
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:46,144
to a luxurious dinner?

75
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:46,424
Right?

76
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:46,904
Good point.

77
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:47,664
Dinner on you.

78
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:48,384
Dinner on you.

79
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:49,744
Fine. Dinner on me.

80
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,184
The boss lady rules.

81
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:51,664
Dinner on me.

82
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:54,904
I have a question.

83
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:58,024
Is office romance

84
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:01,264
allowed in our company now?

85
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:02,304
Is it?

86
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:03,944
No.

87
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,264
We don't have specific rules

88
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:06,824
saying that it's not allowed.

89
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:09,264
But you can't let it affect work.

90
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:10,824
This rule applies to all.

91
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:12,744
You should find a balance.

92
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:13,744
Rest assured.

93
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:16,024
I'll slack off work anyway.

94
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,904
Come on, Mr. Hu.

95
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:19,904
Be considerate to the single ones

96
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,104
like us.

97
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:23,744
I'll treat the single ones to coffee.

98
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:24,584
Alright.

99
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:25,264
Make an order.

100
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:25,544
Come on.

101
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:26,544
Come on.

102
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:29,224
Miss Bai.

103
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,544
You're finally going to
taste the bitterness of love.

104
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:36,184
Besties are meant to share weal and woe.

105
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:38,744
And me.

106
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:40,664
Go ahead.

107
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:41,384
Go ahead.

108
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:41,784
Which one?

109
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:48,424
(You've been ignoring me the whole day.)

110
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,424
(Coming.)

111
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:00,184
You've worked hard
on our biggest project

112
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:01,344
this year.

113
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,744
Continue in ten minutes.

114
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:03,784
Thank you, Nan.

115
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:08,284
What's wrong?

116
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:28,744
(I'm out of energy.)

117
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:29,864
(I need to charge.)

118
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:41,784
(Okay, work hard.)

119
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:48,264
Look at An Ran.

120
00:05:56,744 --> 00:05:57,984
(Kisses.)

121
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,744
She's smiling at the phone.

122
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:07,024
What does that mean?

123
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:08,304
What?

124
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:26,704
Miss An.

125
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,784
You told us to find the balance.

126
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:31,304
Same for you.

127
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:37,184
Alright, guys.

128
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,584
That's all for me.

129
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,144
Anything else?

130
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:41,864
Here.

131
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:43,984
Our previous draft.

132
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:44,704
- Take a look.
- Okay.

133
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,704
Our art group has some suggestions.

134
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:47,184
Peng.

135
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:47,704
Miss An.

136
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,584
I'd like to optimize the animation.

137
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,344
It's still slightly dull.

138
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:55,224
Let Yaoyao modify the characters.

139
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:56,344
After all, she's...

140
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:56,904
French...

141
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,424
Keep working on the scene effects.

142
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:02,264
Okay.

143
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:03,304
Miss An.

144
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:06,144
All 28 servers of Boyfriend are packed.

145
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:08,584
Shall we set up another ten?

146
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,864
Of course.

147
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:12,144
All 28 servers are packed!

148
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:16,464
Come on, bubble tea.

149
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,024
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

150
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:20,424
Mr. Hu.

151
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:21,464
Come on.

152
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:22,144
Mr. Hu.

153
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:22,784
Where is Chen Rui?

154
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:23,784
I got one for her.

155
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:25,024
She went for market research.

156
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:25,544
For you.

157
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:27,024
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

158
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:27,744
It's iced.

159
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:28,704
You're so considerate.

160
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:30,024
No?

161
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:30,784
He drinks tea.

162
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:32,104
Fine.

163
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:34,384
Healthy style.

164
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,064
This is not fair.

165
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:42,984
I want one too.

166
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:43,504
Shut up.

167
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,784
I can't have bubble tea. I'm on a diet.

168
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:48,144
You're on a diet?

169
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:49,184
Really?

170
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,304
Sweetheart, I need a straw.

171
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:54,144
So cheesy.

172
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:54,864
Mr. Hu.

173
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:55,584
Take this.

174
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,744
Are you done with the audiobook?

175
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:18,704
We recorded twice.

176
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,064
We'll go on later.

177
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:21,984
Seriously,

178
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:23,024
a relationship

179
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:24,664
undermines the passion for work.

180
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:48,704
(Once we get over)

181
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,504
(the awkwardness of a new relationship)

182
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,264
(and enter the sweet period of love,)

183
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:55,184
(it seems possible to do well)

184
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,624
(both in love and career.)

185
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,024
(And our lives become busier.)

186
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:10,704
The novel Lovely Moonlight
was already a hit.

187
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:11,904
I didn't expect

188
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:13,544
that the audiobook would catch up

189
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:15,184
with the novel within two sessions.

190
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:16,184
Yeah, look.

191
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:17,424
We Who Love Voices

192
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,144
hit the headlines right after it's out.

193
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:21,224
Mr. Heisha is indeed handsome...

194
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,264
See? I told you.

195
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,224
The show and the audiobook

196
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:27,144
both went viral.

197
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:29,464
It's going to be
a great year for the studio.

198
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:31,784
The audiobook succeeded
because of the content.

199
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,264
But the contester in the show
is underqualified.

200
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:35,584
But they're keeping him.

201
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:37,104
I won't say yes.

202
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:39,824
These shows tend to

203
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,024
have this problem indeed.

204
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,904
Nan, follow up on that.

205
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,544
The last time I spoke to the producer,

206
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,464
she gave me her word.

207
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:49,024
It should be fine.

208
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,344
Anyway, I won't be their cat's-paw.

209
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:54,184
Nan, keep me updated

210
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:55,104
if they contact you.

211
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:56,144
Alright.

212
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,384
(Off work. Heading to you now.)

213
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:09,904
What's wrong, Shan?

214
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:11,024
You look so serious.

215
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:11,824
Come and see.

216
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:13,984
(No way.)

217
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:15,304
(Why do I remember)

218
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:17,264
(that the author said
in the live stream)

219
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:18,384
(that she hadn't authorized)

220
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,944
(the copyright for the audiobook?)

221
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:23,224
What's going on?

222
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:24,704
Haven't we confirmed

223
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,784
with Southern Lights Copyright

224
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:28,304
several times?

225
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:29,464
It can't be.

226
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:31,784
Stay calm.

227
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,224
I'll ask the legal team.

228
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:34,904
Go figure it out.

229
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:35,584
Alright.

230
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:43,344
I'm running late.

231
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,584
I'm going to get changed.

232
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:45,704
I'll get you to work.

233
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:47,224
No need.

234
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,784
I'll get a cab.

235
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:50,424
Rock, paper, scissors.

236
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:53,984
Bye.

237
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:54,904
Be careful.

238
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:56,464
Slow down.

239
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:01,904
Hello?

240
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:03,704
Qingqing just posted something.

241
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:04,904
Get everyone

242
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:06,264
working on Lovely Moonlight

243
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,424
to my office.

244
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:09,824
(I, as)

245
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:11,744
(the copyright owner
of Lovely Moonlight,)

246
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:12,584
(solemnly declare)

247
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:14,264
(that the audiobook)

248
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:16,144
(based on my novel was produced)

249
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:17,544
(without my permission.)

250
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,024
(Therefore,)

251
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:20,704
(I call on you to respect the original)

252
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:22,664
(and boycott any infringement.)

253
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:29,864
(Come to the studio.)

254
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,984
(Weibo messages)

255
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:33,984
(Weibo messages)
So many messages?

256
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:42,528
(Didn't expect you to be such a person.
So disappointed.)

257
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:46,046
(I thought you are not like this.
Rocked my world.)

258
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:50,934
(It may not be what it appears to be.
Come and clarify.)

259
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,704
Is online opinion still one-sided?

260
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:57,504
Inform

261
00:11:57,504 --> 00:11:58,744
all our voice actors

262
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:00,904
not to express any opinion.

263
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,304
(The innocent will always be innocent.)

264
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:12,104
Mr. Heisha just...

265
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:17,168
(Heisha posted a Weibo:
The innocent will always be innocent.)

266
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:24,584
We've confirmed with Southern Lights

267
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:25,944
at the very beginning

268
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:28,024
that they had obtained the five-year

269
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:28,944
adaptation rights.

270
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:30,904
The audiobook must be included.

271
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:34,104
But the authorization

272
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,264
involves many aspects.

273
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,264
They haven't shown us the original file

274
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,264
of the authorization for an audiobook.

275
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,024
We can't

276
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,784
get hold of their project manager

277
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,264
and can't confirm it.

278
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:44,944
What about the author?

279
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:45,784
We've contacted her.

280
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:47,904
She'd only talk to Southern Lights.

281
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:50,224
Then she should release a statement

282
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:52,584
to clarify that it's not our problem.

283
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:53,224
She refused

284
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:55,184
to do so before we figure things out

285
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:56,864
with Southern Lights.

286
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:58,784
To put it simply,

287
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:00,384
she wants us to pressure

288
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:01,264
Southern Lights.

289
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:03,024
We've prepared a lawyer's letter.

290
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:04,344
But it takes time.

291
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:06,984
What's going on?

292
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,784
It's ranking second on the news list.

293
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:15,784
Oaks Literature stated

294
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:17,104
to withdraw the copyright.

295
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:19,184
What are we waiting for? Clarify it.

296
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:21,384
We have the copyright, don't we?

297
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:23,864
Bro.

298
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:24,984
Your statement

299
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:26,664
negates 100 statements of ours.

300
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:27,904
Look.

301
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:29,664
Because of your comment,

302
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:30,904
everyone is targeting

303
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:32,104
our art studio,

304
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:33,544
accusing us of infringement.

305
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:34,584
They know nothing

306
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,544
about Southern Lights or Oaks Literature

307
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,864
and only target whoever comes out.

308
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,144
The only thing you should do

309
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:46,784
is be invisible.

310
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:47,904
Understand?

311
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:49,584
So you're saying

312
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:51,104
it's Southern Light's fault?

313
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,664
We shouldn't have trusted them.

314
00:13:58,544 --> 00:14:00,864
They're hiding and not giving

315
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:02,344
any comments.

316
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:04,104
We can't get hold of anyone

317
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,344
so we don't know if there's a problem.

318
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:07,984
So our declaration...

319
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:11,744
Also,

320
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:13,784
with all the media watching,

321
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:15,224
it's getting worse

322
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:17,184
and even implicating

323
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,224
Fragment Time Boyfriend.

324
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:22,344
Oh, no.

325
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:23,424
Something happened.

326
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:25,184
What's wrong?

327
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:26,304
Check out the news.

328
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:27,784
The news.

329
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:30,664
Someone is starting to comment

330
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,664
on the infringement

331
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,024
of Mr. Heisha in our game forum

332
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,664
and asking us to fire him.

333
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:35,584
Look.

334
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:38,104
JS Sound Art Studio has made a statement

335
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:39,344
but it didn't work.

336
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:41,024
What should we do?

337
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,464
What does it have to do

338
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:44,304
with their game?

339
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:46,864
They're going after everyone.

340
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,104
Just stay quiet.

341
00:14:54,704 --> 00:14:56,224
(I didn't know Heisha was like that.)

342
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:57,424
(Infringement!)

343
00:14:58,024 --> 00:14:58,944
(He can no longer)

344
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:00,664
(hold his nice image.)

345
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:03,584
(He doesn't care
about his reputation at all.)

346
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:04,504
(Disgusting.)

347
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,504
(He just wants money.)

348
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:07,504
(It's said)

349
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,584
(that the questionable contester)

350
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:11,264
(in We Who Love Voices knows Heisha.)

351
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:12,544
(Think about it.)

352
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:15,024
Hello?

353
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:16,584
I didn't know you were like this.

354
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,024
You think nobody would expose you?

355
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:21,824
Don't drag the studio down
with what you've done.

356
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:23,904
(Internal information.)

357
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:27,264
(It's said that Heisha
is working with the trending game)

358
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:28,704
(Fragment Time Boyfriend)

359
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:30,824
(at an extremely low price.)

360
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,104
(And he seems really close
to the vice president)

361
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,344
(of Gaishi Unparalleled.)

362
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:37,024
(I won't say more)

363
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:38,624
(about it.)

364
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:41,544
(I heard the boss of Gaishi Unparalleled
has hooked up with Heisha,)

365
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:43,624
(and got the investment directly.)

366
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,424
(Such women are the most disgraceful,)

367
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:46,384
(always relying on men.)

368
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:47,304
(They're no good.)

369
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:47,864
(Yeah.)

370
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:49,424
(Such women are the most disgraceful,)

371
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:50,584
(always relying on men.)

372
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,024
(They're no good.)

373
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,784
(Maybe Heisha is living off her.)

374
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:56,784
(When will Heisha retire?)

375
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:58,984
(No way.)

376
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:00,704
(Are there still people
whitewashing him?)

377
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:03,184
(Can you stand out and say something?)

378
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:10,184
Yan Yue.

379
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:12,224
Yan Yue.

380
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:14,624
Can you hear me, Yan Yue?

381
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:16,864
Yan Yue.

382
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:18,744
Yan Yue.

383
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:22,384
Are you okay?

384
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,304
Are you sick?

385
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:37,504
Feeling better?

386
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:53,944
An Ran.

387
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,064
I'm sorry.

388
00:16:58,264 --> 00:16:59,384
It's all my fault.

389
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:02,744
I got you involved.

390
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:04,264
It's not your fault.

391
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:08,104
It's okay.

392
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,064
You were right.

393
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,704
The innocent will always be innocent.

394
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:12,984
Right?

395
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:22,304
Do you think I shouldn't have

396
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:24,464
posted that?

397
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:31,104
Have you consulted your staff

398
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:32,824
before posting that?

399
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:36,344
But they were slandering us.

400
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:40,624
I know.

401
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:42,744
But I think

402
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,584
Jiang Shan and Nan have a plan.

403
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:48,464
They don't want you to post anything.

404
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:51,744
But how can I turn a blind eye

405
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:54,904
to those rumors?

406
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,584
But the problem is

407
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:05,224
you're a public figure.

408
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:06,704
You never

409
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,224
speak for yourself.

410
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,704
An Ran.

411
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:15,944
Do you think I was wrong?

412
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:21,744
It's not the time
to discuss right and wrong.

413
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:22,984
I just think

414
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:27,064
maybe it's better if you can

415
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,624
discuss it with them
before posting that.

416
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:32,464
It may cause less trouble.

417
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:37,744
Do you think I've caused you trouble?

418
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:40,744
Yan Yue.

419
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:43,464
Why would you say that?

420
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:44,704
Don't be petty, okay?

421
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:48,784
Go home.

422
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:51,144
I'd like to be alone for a while.

423
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:58,184
Yan Yue, I'll let you calm down.

424
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:00,464
Have the noodles.

425
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:01,464
See you later.

(Negative comments on
Fragment Time Boyfriend)

440
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,726
(Get a new voice actor.)

441
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:58,416
(Yeah, please.)

442
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:01,778
(Not a tainted voice actor.)

443
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:03,440
(Replace him or we quit.)

444
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,528
(I've been playing for so long.)

445
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,256
(I don't think it's so simple.)

446
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:06,928
(It's wrongdoing.)

447
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:13,424
(Impressive. Why?)

448
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:13,904
(Unacceptable.)

449
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:19,304
Our game

450
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,464
is flooded by negative comments.

451
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:25,584
Will it sabotage the release?

452
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:37,064
Our top priority is to decide

453
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,624
whether to replace Heisha.

454
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:44,344
Before we make any decisions,

455
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:44,688
we should

456
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:46,704
figure everything out.

457
00:22:47,704 --> 00:22:49,864
I agree. Heisha is my brother.

458
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,104
I know him and trust him.

459
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,344
He wouldn't have done that.

460
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:52,944
Yeah.

461
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:56,104
Mr. Heisha helped us with the dubbing

462
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:57,504
without asking for money.

463
00:22:57,864 --> 00:22:58,984
We're partners, right?

464
00:22:59,984 --> 00:23:01,584
Now, our partner is in trouble.

465
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:02,944
We can't abandon him.

466
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,344
Changfeng is right.

467
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,384
I agree.

468
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:08,944
Without Mr. Heisha,

469
00:23:08,944 --> 00:23:10,984
we couldn't have come so far.

470
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:26,784
Lansheng contacted you?

471
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:29,344
They say that the netizens

472
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:31,464
are targeting
Fragment Time Boyfriend now.

473
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,464
The game is going to be released.

474
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:35,344
We should get rid of the trouble

475
00:23:35,344 --> 00:23:36,104
just in case.

476
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:38,264
How ruthless are they?

477
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:40,144
Our game got involved

478
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:41,464
obviously because

479
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:43,264
someone was pushing it.

480
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:45,704
If we replace Heisha right now,

481
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:47,744
it's like confirming the rumors.

482
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:48,624
Yeah.

483
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:50,024
Even I can figure it out.

484
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:54,104
They say that public opinion

485
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:56,224
weighs more than what we can imagine.

486
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:57,504
The game is getting released.

487
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,144
There isn't much time for us.

488
00:24:01,944 --> 00:24:04,624
They contacted you, but not me.

489
00:24:08,104 --> 00:24:10,224
I bet they've become
aware of my relationship

490
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:11,264
with Yan Yue.

491
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:13,584
How about this?

492
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:14,944
Contact Lansheng.

493
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,104
Ask for two or three more days.

494
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:18,864
I will find a solution

495
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:20,864
before the game is released.

496
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:23,624
Sure, I'll bear the pressure.

497
00:24:23,624 --> 00:24:24,224
No problem.

498
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:25,624
If it's up to me,

499
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,664
we should take this chance

500
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:28,784
to replace Heisha.

501
00:24:29,104 --> 00:24:30,384
He doesn't cooperate

502
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:31,904
and keeps causing us trouble.

503
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,504
What do you think?

504
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:35,984
All other judges

505
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:37,624
agree to stick to our script.

506
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:39,144
He's the only one

507
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,624
who never cooperates.

508
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:42,384
I can't work with him.

509
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:44,664
But we

510
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:46,384
signed the contract for the season.

511
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:47,504
Boss,

512
00:24:47,504 --> 00:24:49,024
he's in so much trouble

513
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:50,024
right now.

514
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:52,184
We're replacing
a voice actor with controversy.

515
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,224
What's the problem?

516
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:57,224
Look.

517
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:59,104
This is the game he has worked on.

518
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:01,224
It's getting boycotted.

519
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,704
It's the best moment to get rid of him.

520
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:12,624
(I was planning to download the game)

521
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,304
(after its release.)

522
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,944
(But there's something dirty there.)

523
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,984
(I'll just switch to another game.)

524
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,744
(I never appreciated Heisha's dubbing.)

525
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:21,064
(And now this?)

526
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:22,904
(I won't play until he's replaced.)

527
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,064
I'm sure you're aware

528
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:33,984
that

529
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:35,744
Fragment Time Boyfriend

530
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,824
has been boycotted

531
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:39,504
by many loyal fans because of you.

532
00:25:39,824 --> 00:25:41,224
We,

533
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,224
especially An Ran,

534
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:44,104
don't want to see something like that.

535
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:51,984
I've suggested An Ran

536
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:54,224
find someone to replace you.

537
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:57,704
But she wouldn't do so.

538
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:05,224
An Ran has worked so hard

539
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:07,824
for this game until now.

540
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,864
You know better than anyone.

541
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:13,504
If she insists on keeping you,

542
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:15,184
I believe

543
00:26:15,744 --> 00:26:16,864
the board of directors

544
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:18,584
will not hesitate

545
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:20,344
to fire her and Gaishi Unparalleled

546
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:22,984
and ask for three times
the liquidated damages.

547
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:26,464
Someone is using

548
00:26:26,464 --> 00:26:28,464
your relationship to cause trouble.

549
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:31,224
But you simply can't turn the tide.

550
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:34,864
I think the incident
will continue to develop

551
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:37,104
in an extremely ugly

552
00:26:37,104 --> 00:26:38,224
and embarrassing way.

553
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,184
The one who suffers the most
will be An Ran.

554
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:44,344
The two of you don't even

555
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:47,344
stand a chance against it.

556
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:53,864
Yan Yue.

557
00:26:56,504 --> 00:26:59,184
The best option is to drop out now.

558
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:01,384
You have to find a way

559
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:04,344
to minimize its impact
on the two of you.

560
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:22,624
Where are you?

561
00:27:22,904 --> 00:27:23,304
What?

562
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,744
Don't come to the studio these days.

563
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,104
Stay at home.

564
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:28,664
What's going on?

565
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:29,744
Nothing.

566
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:30,904
Just do as I say.

567
00:27:31,104 --> 00:27:31,744
Nan,

568
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:33,744
the media is swamping us
with phone calls.

569
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:34,584
What do we do?

570
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,504
And that project we signed

571
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:37,784
is getting canceled.

572
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,184
Later.

573
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,440
(We Who Love Voices terminates
collaboration with Mr. Heisha.)

574
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:57,224
(Mr. Heisha has been)

575
00:27:57,224 --> 00:27:58,304
(acting arrogant)

576
00:27:58,504 --> 00:27:59,984
(during the filming)

577
00:28:00,184 --> 00:28:00,984
(and has already)

578
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:02,624
(displeased the staff.)

579
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:04,544
(Fragment Time Boyfriend)

580
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:05,824
(hasn't made any statements.)

581
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:07,504
(Now the pressure is on them.)

582
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:09,144
(Is Mr. Heisha really)

583
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:11,544
(having an affair with this boss lady?)

584
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:27,384
We Who Love Voices

585
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:28,544
is so despicable,

586
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:30,144
hitting a person who is down.

587
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:31,144
So shameless.

588
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:32,024
It's a slander.

589
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:32,904
They're shady but they

590
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:34,784
accuse Heisha
of not cooperating. Impressive.

591
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:37,184
Our reservation page is taken over

592
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:38,384
by malicious comments.

593
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:40,184
They threaten to boycott the game

594
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:41,264
until we replace Heisha.

595
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:42,664
Oh, my god.

596
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:44,384
They have nothing better to do?

597
00:28:48,104 --> 00:28:49,144
What does PR say?

598
00:28:49,784 --> 00:28:52,264
They suggest
we terminate the cooperation.

599
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:18,024
(Come on. Cheers.)

600
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:19,784
I'm only having this.

601
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:33,744
(If I were you,)

602
00:29:34,104 --> 00:29:36,744
(I would stay away from An Ran for now.)

603
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,864
(It's good for you and An Ran.)

604
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,424
(Think about it.)

605
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:27,536
(An Ran)

606
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:30,184
Hello, the number you have dialed

607
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:31,184
is busy.

608
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:33,104
Please try again later.

609
00:30:51,304 --> 00:30:52,144
They say

610
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,904
dreams are expensive here.

611
00:30:57,664 --> 00:30:59,664
I think that makes sense.

612
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,024
Mr. Zhang, if you stop
the promotion now,

613
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:17,744
our game can't be released in time.

614
00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:18,624
Miss An.

615
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:20,904
We're not newbies in this business.

616
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:23,784
You're using
a voice actor with controversy.

617
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,104
Your game may not even be released.

618
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,264
I suggest

619
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:29,744
we pause the promotion for now.

620
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:30,464
That's it.

621
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:31,024
Listen.

622
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:32,504
Hello?

623
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:34,024
Hello?

624
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:42,464
(Miss An.)

625
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:43,384
(The game media)

626
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:44,704
(keep asking us whether)

627
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:46,304
(we're replacing Heisha.)

628
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,424
(I can't stall them anymore.)

629
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:52,664
(Miss An, someone
posted your photo online.)

630
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:59,464
(I heard Heisha and that boss lady)

631
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:00,744

633
00:32:02,184 --> 00:32:03,184

634
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:03,544
(Oh my.)

635
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:04,704

638
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,904
(Boycott tainted voice actor.)

639
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:14,904
Yan Yue, I'm sorry.

640
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,904
I shouldn't have said that.

641
00:33:22,104 --> 00:33:23,184
I was too emotional.

642
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:35,504
How will you make it up to me?

643
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
What do you say?

644
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,264
Cook for me.

645
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:42,904
What should I make?

646
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:43,784
Xiaolongbao.

647
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:45,184
You've made them before.

648
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:46,904
Remember?

649
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:48,864
Of course.

650
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:50,144
It took me all night.

651
00:33:52,144 --> 00:33:54,104
You dare to eat the ones I make?

652
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,264
I'll love them.
