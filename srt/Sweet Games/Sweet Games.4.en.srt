(What does he mean?)

41
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:18,754
(Is he reminding me
of the boundary here?)

42
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:27,234
(No way. Just for the free water?)

00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:40,656
(Call from Mr. Wang.)

44
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:44,074
Hello, Mr. Wang?

45
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,074
Miss An,

46
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:46,514
about Treasure Pavilion,

47
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:47,914
let Heisha join it.

48
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,194
If he doesn't,

49
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:50,554
I'm afraid

50
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:51,994
it may fail with your qualifications.

51
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:52,994
I understand.

52
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,634
(So I still have to do that project.)

53
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:19,394
This is the background of the game.

54
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:21,434
We want to create a paradise

55
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,954
that feels like the Wizard of Oz.

56
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,154
That's

57
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:28,314
all the requirements of Mr. Wang's
new Treasure Pavilion project.

58
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,554
Isn't it a bit far-fetched, Miss An?

59
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:36,194
Miss An,

60
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:38,634
do we really have to
make such a game again?

61
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:42,754
I know.

62
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:47,074
But at the moment, we really don't have
any new investments coming in.

63
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:48,394
What should we do next month?

64
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:53,314
But, Miss An, the last final payment
hasn't been settled yet.

65
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:55,674
What if there's any risk?

66
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:56,874
What should we do then?

67
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:58,754
Don't worry about the final payment.

68
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:00,914
If worst comes to worst,
you still have me.

69
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,674
I've looked at the illustrations.
They are not very difficult.

70
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,234
They won't take much time.

71
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:06,634
I can try.

72
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:08,554
I know, Peng,

73
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:11,354
you're just worried
that we're working in vain.

74
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:14,994
But we really don't have
any other options.

75
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:16,714
Tian Xin,

76
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,674
you're most familiar
with the young people.

77
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:20,354
What's the outlook for this project?

78
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:21,874
I think

79
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,794
it's pretty grounded in the market.

80
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:25,514
There should be
a decent audience for it.

81
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:27,834
Okay.

82
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,354
Then let's hold on and go for it.

83
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:33,474
I'll take charge of the presentation.

84
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:35,434
Then what are we waiting for?

85
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:36,874
Let's get to work.

86
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:38,554
Let's go, Peng.

87
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:39,954
Come, Tian Xin.

88
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:40,634
Hurry up.

89
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,314
You're the artist.
You should move first.

90
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:49,034
For dubbing, do we still use Heisha?

91
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:52,354
I've tried several times.

92
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:53,994
Yan Yue doesn't want to come.

93
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:55,434
I'll go talk to him.

94
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:58,354
Wait. This isn't something he likes.

95
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,914
Then tell me, what do we do without him?

96
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,514
Hello, Mr. Heisha.

97
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:15,794
Hey, can't you show me some respect?

98
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,874
I'm your boss, after all.

99
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:20,154
Hello, boss.

100
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,714
You seem a bit off lately.

101
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:26,114
Do you have something on your mind?

102
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,434
You're in love with someone?

103
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,954
And she doesn't like you?

104
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,634
Who is it? Do I know her?

105
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,434
You don't know her. Stop asking.

106
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:35,754
You've let it slip.

107
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:38,914
You can't escape my sunglasses.

108
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:40,234
Tell you what.

109
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,834
You have to observe girls.

110
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,834
Young girls like romance,

111
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,234
and mature women like warmth.

112
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:55,674
Strong women are very fragile inside.

113
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,314
They need more care.

114
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,794
Girls who are weak on the outside

115
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:02,074
are actually stronger inside
than anyone else.

116
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:06,074
So, no matter
which type of woman you like,

117
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:07,634
they all have weaknesses.

118
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:10,434
First, you need to
understand her completely.

119
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:13,354
Then find her weakness
and win her over.

120
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,714
You can take your time.
Ask me if you don't understand.

121
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:21,874
I don't want to...

122
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,336
We've been buddies for so many years.

123
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:26,474
Helping each other is only natural.

124
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,954
I'll help you solve your love problems,

125
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:31,314
and you will also help me
solve my love problems, okay?

126
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:32,794
How do you have love problems again?

127
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,354
It's the girl
I told you about last time.

128
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:36,274
The one with talent

129
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:38,074
but sings a bit off-key.

130
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:39,714
She's waiting for you.

131
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:40,914
You're already late.

132
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:41,554
Hurry up.

133
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,634
- I...
- Come.

134
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:50,896
(Yan Yue and An Ran's
WeChat conversation)

135
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:35,754
The moonlight tonight

136
00:09:36,394 --> 00:09:38,114
is really nice.

137
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:56,634
(Do you want to come over
and play games?)

138
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,194
I'm working overtime at the company

139
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:06,434
for Mr. Wang's project.

140
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:07,714
I'm not in the mood to play today.

141
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:08,634
You play by yourself.

142
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:12,394
So obstinate?

143
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,954
(It's like When Harry Met Sally.)

144
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,674
(It's like a stream
falling in love with a river.)

145
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,554
(Too many people say they don't care,)

146
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:38,274
(but they always think of someone)

147
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:39,914
(for no reason.)

148
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,354
(I think of you catching a cold
at 71 degrees Fahrenheit.)

149
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,434
(I think of your fuss
over a few dollars.)

150
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:50,714
(Heisha time)

151
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,514
(I think of you taking an hour
and a half to order a sandwich.)

152
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:58,434
(I think of the lingering fragrance
of your perfume after you left.)

153
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:37,114
Guys,

154
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,354
Mr. Wang has sent over
new reference opinions.

155
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,594
We need to make minor modifications
according to the previous requirements.

156
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,234
The clients are quite demanding.

157
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:53,834
Keep up with your hard work.

158
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:54,994
Afternoon tea is on me.

159
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:56,994
Tonight, I will treat everyone
to Japanese food.

160
00:11:57,394 --> 00:11:58,714
No problem, bosses.

161
00:11:58,714 --> 00:11:59,594
No problem.

162
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,514
Has the final payment been settled?

163
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:10,914
So shameless.

164
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:13,954
I'll give him a call.

165
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:28,594
I'll go find him directly.

166
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:26,914
Miss An, Mr. Wang
is not in the company today.

167
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,394
Why don't you go back first?

168
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:30,994
He's not in the company?

169
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:33,314
That's okay. I'm free today.

170
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:34,474
I'll just wait here.

171
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:35,914
What if Mr. Wang comes back?

172
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:41,634
Is it a bit inconvenient?

173
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:43,994
That's fine. I will wait at the door.

174
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:46,154
I'll wait at the door. No problem.

175
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:49,954
Miss Lan?

176
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:51,034
An Ran.

177
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:52,874
What are you doing here?

178
00:13:53,554 --> 00:13:54,874
I came to find Mr. Wang.

179
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:55,994
You too?

180
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:56,674
Yes.

181
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:59,274
That's a pity.
He seems to be out of the office.

182
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,474
Miss Lan, why did you
come so early today?

183
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:04,394
Would you like to come in
for tea first?

184
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:06,074
Isn't he out?

185
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:07,994
Miss Lan,

186
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,714
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

187
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:10,354
Mr. Wang?

188
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,514
When did you come back?

189
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,594
I've been waiting here all along
and haven't seen you.

190
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:16,954
Miss An, you're here too.

191
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:17,674
Yes.

192
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:19,674
I don't have anything important.

193
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,914
I just thought you might be too busy,

194
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:23,274
and you would forget us.

195
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,594
I just have a few words.

196
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:26,114
It won't take long.

197
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:27,674
That's okay.

198
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:29,954
About the modification of the proposal,

199
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:32,274
I'll let Li talk to you about it later.

200
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,834
Then, the final payment for
the World of Imagination...

201
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,554
Mr. Wang, how about this?

202
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:49,474
You deal with Miss An's matter first.

203
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,434
I'll wait for you
in the conference room.

204
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:52,874
No need.

205
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,114
Miss An,

206
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:56,714
this final payment matter

207
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:58,114
is not a big deal.

208
00:14:58,714 --> 00:14:59,314
How about this?

209
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:01,514
I'll let the finance department
arrange it for you right now.

210
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:02,554
That's great.

211
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:05,194
But the most important thing
is the bidding materials.

212
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:07,034
You must not delay me.

213
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:10,034
Don't worry. We are working hard on it.

214
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:11,234
Then I won't see you out.

215
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:12,754
Miss Lan, this way, please.

216
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:26,194
Such a miser!

217
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:21,914
(What should I say?)

218
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:35,914
Who is it?

219
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,074
It's me.

220
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:52,234
The rent receipt.

221
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:56,314
My mom asked me to give it to you.

222
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,194
You are finally willing to talk to me.

223
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:10,194
Why do you have so many packages?

224
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:18,594
Let me bring them in for you.

225
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:21,914
Thank you.

226
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:23,714
Put them here.

227
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,714
Just place them here.

228
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:54,274
Don't move.

229
00:17:59,474 --> 00:18:00,034
Does it hurt?

230
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:07,714
Let me do it myself.

231
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:12,114
Thank you.

232
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:22,754
What's wrong?

233
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:27,914
It's nothing.

234
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:40,354
Hospital, now.

235
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,354
I don't want to.

236
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:46,114
Let's go to the hospital
for an IV or an injection.

237
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:46,954
You will get better soon.

238
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:49,514
I won't go. I have medicine at home.

239
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:50,754
I will just take some medicine.

240
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,954
I don't want to go to the hospital.

241
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,794
How about you take some medicine
and then get some sleep?

242
00:18:56,954 --> 00:18:59,474
I can't. I haven't finished
my proposal yet.

243
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:01,674
Don't worry.

244
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,248
I'll take some medicine now.

245
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:04,874
Taking some medicine will do.

246
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:06,154
There's not much work left.

247
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:08,194
Just a bit of formatting.

248
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:09,874
Look, here's the medicine.

249
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:26,874
Why have you suddenly
become so considerate?

250
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:30,274
What if...

251
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:33,634
What if you faint

252
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:34,674
and something happens?

253
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:36,434
No one will rent this room, then.

254
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:15,354
Why are you smiling?

255
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:18,314
No, I'm not.

256
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:23,194
You are hallucinating from the fever.

257
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:28,474
No. I clearly saw you smiling.

258
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:32,834
Look how sleepy you are.

259
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:34,234
Finish it tomorrow.

260
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:37,194
The medicine must be working.

261
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:38,514
I'm so sleepy.

262
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,834
I better get some sleep.

263
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,514
I'll get up later to continue.

264
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:46,594
I'll wake you up in a bit.

265
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:47,954
You go to sleep first.

266
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:50,074
Thank you.

267
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:19,394
What's that?

268
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:32,114
Wake up and have some water.

269
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,754
Thank you.

270
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,034
Sorry.

271
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:02,514
D-Don't talk anymore.

272
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,954
Finish it and get some rest quickly.

273
00:22:34,514 --> 00:22:35,234
To cool you down.

274
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:38,754
Maybe

275
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:41,234
you should go home first.

276
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,434
I can just set an alarm.

277
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:52,514
I'm putting the trash can
and tissues next to you.

278
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:54,034
I can see you have a runny nose.

279
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:55,874
If your throat feels uncomfortable,

280
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,914
I have some...

281
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,114
(She's young.)

282
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:04,234
(Yet she always takes care of others.)

283
00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:50,794
Do you feel better?

284
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:00,714
Why haven't you left yet?

285
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,514
Your place is too messy.
I can't stand it.

286
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:06,674
So I will tidy it up a bit for you.

287
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:10,634
So, are you leaving after tidying up?

288
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:12,314
Of course.

289
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:15,434
Yan Yue.

290
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:17,434
What is it?

291
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:20,034
Why have you changed so much?

292
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:28,714
When I was a kid,

293
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:30,434
my mom would make me

294
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,154
noodles with vegetables and eggs.

295
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:34,594
She'd put in lots and lots of pepper.

296
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:37,154
I would sweat a lot.

297
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,914
You seem to perk up
when it's about food.

298
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:42,314
You were so sleepy
when you were working.

299
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:43,434
Leave it for tomorrow.

300
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:45,354
It's already 1:30 AM.

301
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:48,354
You and your stomach need to sleep.

302
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:50,994
Okay.

303
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:57,994
Call me if you need me.

304
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,474
But what about my proposal?

305
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:05,754
May I take a look at it?

306
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:10,514
Of course,

307
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:12,394
if you want.

308
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:15,274
You go to sleep now,

309
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:16,554
and I'll take a look later.

335
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:15,074
there's a new spicy duck bone shop

336
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:16,354
at the entry of our block next door.

337
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:16,954
It's doing great.

338
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:19,714
Don't even think about it
before you're recovered.

339
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:25,794
You can buy some without spice.

340
00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:32,714
Slow down.

341
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:41,954

346
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,074
I dreamed last night
that you had a cold.

347
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,514
I don't have a cold.

348
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:00,554
Don't lie to me.

349
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:01,914
Did you go to the hospital?

350
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,954
Mom, I'm really fine.

351
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:06,576
And I've taken medicine.

352
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,264
I even had noodles
with vegetables and eggs.

353
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:11,834
There was a lot of pepper in it,
and I sweated a lot.

354
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:12,674
Wait.

355
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:14,754
You didn't make
the noodles yourself, right?

356
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:15,954

Mom, I'm busy with work right now.

361
00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:28,034
I need to hang up now.

00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:29,594

00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:10,994
Here you are.

369
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:11,874
Thank you.

370
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:22,714
Why are you here?

371
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,834
Why can't I be here?

372
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:26,554
Wait. Why are you here?

373
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:28,274
Didn't you ask for sick leave?

374
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:29,754
Just to buy duck bones?

375
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:31,274
What's up?

376
00:30:34,274 --> 00:30:35,194
Who are they for?

377
00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:36,474
I remember you don't eat spice.

378
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:39,394
You remembered it wrong.

379
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:40,714
You're fooling me.

380
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,154
Every time I offer you spice,
you say it's bad for your throat.

381
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:45,314
Who is it?

382
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:48,914
Is it that fan girl
who came to record last time?

383
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:54,394
Good for you, Yan Yue.
When did this happen?

384
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:55,834
You remembered it wrong.

385
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:57,114
She's my client.

386
00:30:57,194 --> 00:30:58,674
Who are you fooling?

387
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:01,114
When have you ever cared about a client?

388
00:31:05,634 --> 00:31:07,994
I just knew you liked the mature type.

389
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:12,794
Sit.

390
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:22,794
Even though you two
are an idol and a fan,

391
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:24,114
you are a little brat.

392
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:25,874
Do you know
how to win over a mature woman?

393
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:28,914
What are you trying to say?

394
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:33,514
When you found out
that she likes duck bones,

395
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:36,394
didn't you feel something was off?

396
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,554
Can you just say what you mean?

397
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:42,674
A girl

398
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:45,314
won't eat duck bones
in front of a guy she likes.

399
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:47,154
Why not?

400
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:48,434
Why not?

401
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:52,314
Duck bones are greasy.
You have to use your hands

402
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:53,994
and even get your face dirty.

403
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:55,234
Can a girl allow herself

404
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:57,794
to ruin her image
in front of someone she likes?

405
00:31:58,074 --> 00:31:58,754
Am I right?

406
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:03,154
It's just eating food.
Don't make things up.

407
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,954
There's a lot to learn here.

408
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:07,394
Mr. Heisha, you're still too young.

409
00:32:08,114 --> 00:32:09,474
But when it comes to a relationship,

410
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:10,754
you can't force it.

411
00:32:10,914 --> 00:32:12,194
Eye of the beholder, no?

412
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:15,794
But a mature woman like her

413
00:32:15,794 --> 00:32:17,474
often can't resist

414
00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:18,794
the charm of a mature man like me.

415
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,794
You're just too young.

416
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,194
Mind your own business

417
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:24,034
and wait for your girl.

418
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,434
Invite me to dinner another day.

419
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:27,874
I'll give you a proper lesson.

420
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:44,194
An Ran.

421
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,074
An Ran?

422
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:09,754
An Ran?

423
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:11,794
Yan Yue?

424
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:16,314
Sorry. Nobody answered the door.

425
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:17,834
So I let myself in.

426
00:33:18,954 --> 00:33:20,514
You came back so quickly.

427
00:33:20,954 --> 00:33:23,554
Sit for a while and wait for me.

428
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:35,314
Duck bones are greasy.

429
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,314
Can a girl allow herself

430
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,874
to ruin her image
in front of someone she likes?

431
00:34:15,394 --> 00:34:17,474
That kid does a good deed
and then walks away.

432
00:34:40,794 --> 00:34:41,914
Hello, little Tian Xin.

433
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:44,674
Am I supposed to deliver
the proposal to Mr. Wang tomorrow?

434
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:46,394
It's okay. I'll go.

435
00:34:46,594 --> 00:34:48,874
Mr. Wang's secretary messaged me
early in the morning,

436
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,634
asking me to print it out
and deliver it.

437
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:52,074
That will do.

438
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:53,314
When you see her,

439
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:54,834
please tell her

440
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,914
to hurry up with our final payment.

441
00:34:57,274 --> 00:34:58,032
No problem, Miss An.

442
00:34:59,394 --> 00:34:59,754
Okay.

443
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:15,114
You came back so quickly.

444
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:18,394
Sit for a while and wait for me.

445
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,794
(She really doesn't take me for a man.)

446
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:49,634
Miss Li.

447
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:51,514
Tian Xin.

448
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:54,354
This is our company's proposal.

449
00:35:57,914 --> 00:36:00,274
For the final payment,
Mr. Wang wants you to go to his office.

450
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:24,074
Mr. Wang, do you want to see me?

451
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:24,994
Come in.

452
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,394
You've been working hard recently.

453
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:44,394
I've made so many requests.

454
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:45,834
Does it bother you?

455
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:50,154
No, not at all. It's our job
to meet your requirements.

456
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,274
You don't need to be nervous.

457
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:55,674
I think you are very capable.

458
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:57,594
I hope all your company's projects

459
00:36:57,714 --> 00:36:58,714
are handled by you.

460
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:01,994
Young people should have a bigger stage.

461
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:19,274
How's your drinking capacity?

462
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,114
Look at you. Why are you so nervous?

463
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:26,674
How careless you are.

464
00:37:27,674 --> 00:37:29,034
Sorry, Mr. Wang.

465
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:30,794
Well...

466
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:33,194
For the projects,

467
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:35,554
you should contact Miss An.

468
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,114
I have something to do. I'll leave now.
