77
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:24,706

Thank you.

86
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:51,586
You even made a special trip here.

87
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:54,426

I just wanted to
help you look over it in advance.

91
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:00,266
It's not a problem.

92
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,706
Actually, I was nearby.

00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:09,586
Did you

00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:11,386
listen to the teachers
in the kindergarten today?

What's wrong?

102
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,106
Don't I look like a mother?

103
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:26,386
I thought you were unmarried.

104
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:32,986
She is so cute.

105
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:36,026
You are so busy with work

106
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:37,306
and taking care of her.

107
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:38,386
It must be tiring, right?

108
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:40,986
If I say it's not tiring,

109
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:42,146
I am surely lying.

110
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:43,946
Being a single mom

111
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:45,946
is definitely a bit harder.

112
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:53,826
May I ask

113
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:55,106
where her father is?

114
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,426
We broke up.

115
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,106
He thought I was too dominant

116
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,266
and he was unable control me.

117
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,266
He wasn't willing to stay home
and take care of kid.

118
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,506
How can we live like that?

119
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,866
Then in the future...

120
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:10,586
We'll just keep living like this.

121
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:12,306
The child is with me.

122
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,506
I wouldn't mistreat her.

123
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:15,826
Who says a woman

124
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,226
can't live well on her own?

125
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,146
That's true.

126
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:24,386
Give me the documents.

127
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,026
The periodic report is tomorrow.

128
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:29,226
I've already heard

129
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:30,786
your launch

130
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:32,026
is quite impressive.

131
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,386
The results are okay.

132
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:37,066
Mainly thanks to
your consistent support.

133
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:37,986
Without you,

134
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,746
there wouldn't be "Time Boyfriend" now.

135
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,666
Mainly, you worked hard enough.

136
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:44,346
An Ran,

137
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:48,106
looking at you now,

138
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:49,906
I feel like
I'm looking at myself in the past.

139
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:52,986
Very competitive and determined.

140
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,666
It's quite shameful.

141
00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:01,986
After all these years,

142
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:05,346
it seems like
I've just embarked on the right track.

143
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,186
Among all the variables in life,

144
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:13,226
work is the most certain.

145
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,866
As long as you work hard enough,

146
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:15,986
sooner or later,

147
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,226
there will be a reward.

148
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:20,986
Come on.

149
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:23,666
I wish everything goes well tomorrow.

150
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:53,346
Yan Yue,

151
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:56,106
when did you take this?

152
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:58,906
The production team asked me to do so.

153
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,306
How is it?

154
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,186
So cool.

155
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:23,466
Bro.

156
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:56,866
If this happened to you,

157
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,426
I believe you would
make the same choice as me.

158
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:02,546
Something like romance

159
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,106
won't affect your career, right?

160
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,426
Did you two keep in touch afterward?

161
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:25,466
Can you make it this time?

162
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:29,626
I think

163
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,786
I am at least better than
the last time I broke up.

164
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,186
Significant improvement.

165
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:42,906
There aren't any fundamental issues
between you,

166
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,226
but why didn't you keep in touch?

167
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:48,226
I don't know

168
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,066
how to contact him.

169
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:52,186
Why?

170
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,666
Yan Yue stopped doing voice-overs

171
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:57,786
because of me,

172
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:00,866
and my work is a mess.

173
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:02,666
What's the point of a relationship?

174
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,666
What right do I have

175
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:06,306
to contact him again?

176
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:10,426
To adults,

177
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:13,546
if both people are okay,

178
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,106
everything is okay.

179
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,866
But if one person is not okay,

180
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:20,186
you even can't date.

181
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:23,226
We'd better just focus on
what's in front of us.

182
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:28,746
Did you know that
Miss Lan actually has a daughter?

183
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:31,186
I've heard of that.

184
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:32,866
I didn't know before.

185
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:35,306
She thought

186
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:37,106
I broke up with Yan Yue

187
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,466
because I was afraid
that love would affect my work.

188
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:41,426
She just doesn't understand you.

189
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,786
It would be great if you could enjoy

190
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:44,626
both a career and love.

191
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,786
Enjoy both?

192
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,106
It's indeed difficult.

193
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,226
(Comments for Fragment Time Boyfriend)

194
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:08,866
(This male lead is so cute.)

195
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:10,186
(Although he's a bit immature,)

196
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:11,426
(he's quite talented.)

197
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:13,346
(I heard that
the character design of the male lead)

198
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:15,226
(is very similar to
the voice actor, Heisha.)

199
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:16,786
(Although Heisha has retired now,)

200
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:17,666
(looking at it now,)

201
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,986
(Heisha is just being honest.)

202
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,626
(He is after all
a scandalous voice actor.)

203
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,866
(It's right for him to retire.)

204
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:37,106
Pay attention.

205
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,226
First, you have to crush the soil.

206
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:41,666
After crushing,

207
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,306
take out the flowers
we want to cultivate.

208
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:49,426

209
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:51,106
requires a bit of fun.

210
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,746
Don't be all dressed up outside,

211
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,346
and looking like a mess at home.

Hello?

221
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:29,106
Miss An, something's wrong.

222
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:30,306
There's a problem with the game.

223
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:31,226
Come to the company now.

224
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,426
What happened?

225
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:44,786
How did it

226
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:45,986
get attacked out of the blue?

227
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:47,546
Changfeng is investigating.

228
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:49,666
All the loopholes were fixed
before the launch.

229
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,626
It was normal yesterday,

230
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,226
and suddenly like this today.

231
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,226
Before I got off work,
I specifically logged into the game,

232
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:55,306
and set up a CDN defense,

233
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:56,746
even including the Netplay server,

234
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,546
just to deal with such an emergency.

235
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,466
Can you locate the attacker now?

236
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:02,786
The attack was without warning.

237
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,306
The company's firewall perception

238
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:05,306
didn't even alert.

239
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,306
So, it's impossible
to locate the other party.

240
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,986
Could it be another company,

241
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:12,426
seeing our game is so popular,

242
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,866
so they hired a hacker to attack?

243
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:17,666
Probably not.

244
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:19,226
It could just be

245
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:20,666
a common virus
the hacker sprayed and prayed.

246
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:22,306
Isn't it a common risk

247
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:23,986
faced by game companies?

248
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,626
Our top priority now

249
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,546
is to get the game back online
as soon as possible.

250
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:29,986
Changfeng,

251
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:30,906
do you have any other solutions?

252
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,226
I need some time.

253
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:33,786
How many days?

254
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:35,986
Miss An,

255
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,986
there's an email in the work inbox,

256
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:39,106
saying they'll stop attacking the game

257
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:40,546
if we give them 200 thousand yuan.

258
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,866
200 thousand?

259
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,106
It might be a professional hacker.

260
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,986
Should I borrow some money?

261
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:55,426
No way.

262
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:56,666
Why should you do that?

263
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,546
Paying is the worst plan.

264
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,106
Miss An is right.

265
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,466
Paying will only make them extort more.

266
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:05,426
Give me some time to operate.

267
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:06,866
Rui,

268
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:08,666
you know the market better.

269
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,226
Do you know

270
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:11,226
how other companies

271
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,226
resolve this kind of situation?

272
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:13,906
I...

273
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:16,986
I-I don't know.

274
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:20,666
How about this?

275
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,226
Hu Yingjun and I will go to the police.

276
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:23,786
Let's go.

277
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:37,426
Hello?

278
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,306
An Ran,

279
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:39,986
I heard about the game.

280
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:41,546
What countermeasures do you have now?

281
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:44,866
We don't have any for now.

282
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:46,306
I'm still on a business trip.

283
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:47,666
As soon as I land tomorrow,

284
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,866
we'll have a meeting immediately.

285
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:51,746
Okay.

286
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,226
Miss An, get some rest early.

287
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:04,306
Goodbye, Miss An.

288
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:05,466
Bye, Mr. Hu.

289
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,546
Bye, bye.

290
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:07,666
Bye, Miss An.

291
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,226
Bye.

292
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,466
What should we do, bro?

293
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:51,586
We really don't pay?

294
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:53,466
How do we pay?

295
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,346
How much money do we have?

296
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:01,706
They just target

297
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:03,346
small companies with no backing like us

298
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:05,946
and ruin us in one go.

299
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:09,106
We don't even
have the strength to resist.

300
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,946
Isn't this exactly what hackers aim for?

301
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:22,106
After struggling for so many years,

302
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,706
and finally seeing a bit of success,

303
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,186
I thought

304
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:26,226
I finally

305
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:28,106
could stand firm in Hu's family.

306
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:31,586
But who knew such a curveball
would come halfway?

307
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:35,866
"Time Boyfriend"

308
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:38,186
is the fruit of our years of labors.

309
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:41,426
I won't let it fail.

310
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:44,426
Hu,

311
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:46,106
you must believe in yourself

312
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:48,186
and others.

313
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:51,066
We can make it.

314
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:56,866
I believe in you.

315
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:35,388
(Wayward Courage)

316
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:38,706
(I don't like a life
that's predictable.)

317
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,066
(We use courage as a chip,)

318
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,346
(and leave our hometowns ambitiously.)

319
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,186
(But when the real unknown)

320
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,106
(comes rushing in like a dark tide,)

321
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:50,586
(we have nowhere to hide.)

322
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:52,826
(Fear,)

323
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:53,826
(regret,)

324
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:54,826
(and confusion)

325
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:56,866
(push us gamblers into a corner.)

326
00:17:58,466 --> 00:17:59,546
(Only then we realize)

327
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:00,986
(how expensive)

328
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:02,866
(a bill recklessness is.)

329
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:08,186
(What can we use
to pay for recklessness?)

330
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:11,106
(For those drowning in debt,)

331
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:13,946
(if you still have a few guts
in your pocket,)

332
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:16,306
(take them out bravely.)

333
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,066
(The last chip)

334
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:20,866
(may not help you turn the tables,)

335
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:22,186
(but)

336
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:24,706
(at least you are still in the game.)

337
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,466
Let's pay, Miss An.

338
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:04,546
I don't want to accept the conditions
proposed by them.

339
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:07,066
Because of the finances?

340
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,226
Greed is hard to satisfy.

341
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,786
If it happens once,
it will definitely happen a second time.

342
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,426
But what we are considering now is

343
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:18,706
players have been unable
to log in to the game

344
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:19,946
for more than a day.

345
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,946
If this continues,

346
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,466
it will be a complete loss of players.

347
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,706
When it goes online again,

348
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:26,466
all the previous efforts will be wasted.

349
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:28,186
An Ran,

350
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:30,866
do you have a better solution?

351
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,306
Shut down the server.

352
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:44,066
Return all the money charged
to the players,

353
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,346
and turn the game
into a single-player game.

354
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:46,946
When the situation improves,

355
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:47,986
we can go online again.

356
00:19:51,920 --> 00:20:00,496
(Text from an unknown number:
Understood, proceed as planned.)

357
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,306
Rui.

358
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:05,066
What's wrong with you?

359
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,306
You look so pale.

360
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:07,986
Nothing.

361
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,666
I probably didn't rest well yesterday.

362
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,666
Eat something.

363
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,226
Thanks.

364
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:12,186
I finally know the reason.

365
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:14,226
Why?

366
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:17,986
Our bandwidth

367
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:19,546
has been consumed by attack packets
from different

368
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:20,186
addresses.

369
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,106
This has caused the server
to not function properly.

370
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,186
It is a large-scale organized attack.

371
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:28,106
What should we do now?

372
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,466
Either strengthen
the system's protection,

373
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:36,826
resolving the hacker attack issue first,

374
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:38,426
or switch the server.

375
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,546
But if they want to ransom,

376
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:43,346
even if we change a server,

377
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:46,066
we will only face more severe attacks.

378
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:53,066
Shutting down the server
will affect revenue.

379
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:55,986
We absolutely wouldn't agree.

380
00:20:57,986 --> 00:21:00,306
Why don't you
choose to upgrade the server

381
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:02,586
or collaborate with
big companies directly?

382
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:03,986
Like Gaishi Group.

383
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,786
Collaborating with big companies,

384
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,826
we will only lose our say.

385
00:21:08,186 --> 00:21:09,466
Moreover, "Time Boyfriend"

386
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:10,586
will likely be turned into

387
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:11,706
another game by them.

388
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:13,426
Upgrading the server

389
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,826
also can't solve the root problem.

390
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:18,306
Extortion is a crime in itself.

391
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:18,986
I understand why

392
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,546
companies with the same experience as us

393
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,866
don't dare to stand up.

394
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:22,706
But I...

395
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:24,706
I'm willing

396
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,786
to take the risk.

397
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,106
I'm also willing to stand up.

398
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:28,426
If there's a chance,

399
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,226
I want to clean up

400
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:31,546
all the demons and monsters
in this industry.

401
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:35,986
Take the risk?

402
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,426
How?

403
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,546
You don't even know
who your opponent is.

404
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:46,106
We are just in the initial stages
of being attacked.

405
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,586
If we go offline directly,

406
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:49,426
they will definitely
let down their guard,

407
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:50,426
and then reveal their weakness.

408
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:52,666
The internet is not a lawless place.

409
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,066
We just need time.

410
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:55,826
Alright.

411
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:57,826
Even if we implement your method,

412
00:21:58,226 --> 00:21:59,346
once you find them,

413
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:00,986
countless new games will have launched.

414
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:02,706
Who will still remember
"Time Boyfriend"?

415
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:03,666
An Ran,

416
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:05,786
I need to remind you.

417
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:06,986
Lansheng

418
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:09,346
is in the business of investing,

419
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:11,346
not charity.

420
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:16,426
An Ran,

421
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:18,586
"Fragment Time Boyfriend"

422
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:20,466
is the only and the one

423
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:21,826
independently designed game made by you.

424
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:23,066
I think for its meaning to you

425
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:24,666
and Gaishi Unparalleled,

426
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,466
no one knows it better than you.

427
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:29,466
I hope you can consider it carefully.

428
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,346
It's precisely because
"Fragment Time Boyfriend"

429
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:37,866
and Gaishi Unparalleled

430
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,346
are of extraordinary significance to me.

431
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:41,986
That's why

432
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:43,866
I made this decision.

433
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,386
Switching to a single-player game
is just temporary,

434
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:50,386
but it is currently the best method.

435
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:57,786
Mr. Hu.

436
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:00,426
In fact,

437
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,906
you are the biggest shareholder.

438
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,266
I want your opinion.

439
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:12,546
Miss Lan,

440
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:13,906
Mr. Pei,

441
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:16,626
although I am the biggest shareholder

442
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:17,746
of "Fragment Time Boyfriend",

443
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:18,786
An Ran

444
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:20,746
is the soul of "Time Boyfriend."

445
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:22,626
I support An Ran's decision.

446
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,346
Refund the players' recharges

447
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:26,106
and temporarily switch to
single-player operation.

448
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:30,226
Okay.

449
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:33,346
Since you've already made this decision,

450
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,506
then let's do as you propose.

451
00:23:37,426 --> 00:23:39,026
But we also have rules in our company.

452
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:41,386
When a public relations crisis arises,

453
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:43,546
we have the right to take back
the decision-making power

454
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:45,626
of the project
from the CEO of the invested company,

455
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:47,666
so that our invested company

456
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,626
can smoothly overcome the crisis.

457
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,226
So Mr. Hu,

458
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:54,026
next,

459
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:55,986
you may need to cooperate with Mr. Pei

460
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:58,866
to let us take over

461
00:23:59,226 --> 00:24:00,546
Gaishi Unparalleled for now.

462
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:05,226
An Ran,

463
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:07,666
you also need a rest.

464
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:19,626
An Ran,

465
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,106
I advise you to reconsider.

466
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:37,426
"Fragment Time Boyfriend"
has announced its server shutdown.

467
00:24:37,746 --> 00:24:39,746
I heard it was attacked by hackers,

468
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:40,866
and they didn't want to
accept the ransom,

469
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:42,266
so they had to shut down the server.

470
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,506
That's tough, isn't it?

471
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:44,746
I haven't even registered yet.

472
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:45,626
Can I still play it?

473
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:46,506
Yes, you can,

474
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:48,026
but you can only play offline.

475
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:52,266
How popular it was
when Heisha was there.

476
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:53,106
Don't bring it up.

477
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,904
(Xinjia City)

478
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:29,746
I'll go now.

479
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:30,986
Take your time.

480
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,226
Yan Yue.

481
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:45,146
Yan Yue.

482
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:53,386
You Mai.

483
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:55,146
It really is you.

484
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:57,146
I thought you wouldn't recognize me.

485
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:58,546
After so many years,

486
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:00,026
you haven't changed a bit.

487
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,146
You came to Xinjia City,

488
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:02,786
and you didn't even
greet us old classmates?

489
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:04,226
It's not nice.

490
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,546
Why did you suddenly come here?

491
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:13,546
Actually, I've heard
some things about you.

492
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,746
Y-You really plan to

493
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:16,666
just retire like that?

494
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:22,906
Those people are really boring,

495
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:24,426
making up nonsense
on the internet all day.

496
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:26,906
How have you been recently?

497
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:29,226
Me?

498
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:32,106
I just established
an animation studio last year.

499
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:34,266
Congratulations. Your dream came true.

500
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,226
There is still a long way to go.

501
00:26:38,386 --> 00:26:40,786
Would you like to come visit my studio?

502
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:42,946
To add a bit of grandeur

503
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,226
to my little cappy studio.

504
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:46,666
I-I'd better not.

505
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:47,506
It's settled then.

506
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:49,986
I have to go.

507
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:52,226
It's a deal. I'll contact you later.

508
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,226
Bro, don't go.

509
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,146
What are you guys around me?

510
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:14,346
An Ran,

511
00:27:14,786 --> 00:27:16,986
you've worked hard for this game,

512
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,226
and they just kick you out so easily.

513
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:23,506
Don't misunderstand.
I'm on temporary leave.

514
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:25,666
Look, I can even go on vacation.

515
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,146
Yan Yue left, and you left too.

516
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:31,786
Are you relieved
leaving "Time Boyfriend"

517
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:36,746
in his hands?

518
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:37,786
What's wrong with me?

519
00:27:37,986 --> 00:27:39,226
Are you relieved?

520
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,106
She's right.

521
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:48,226
Help me hold a folder.

522
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,266
You're right.

523
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:01,506
I'm not relieved.

524
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:02,786
Right?

525
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:06,746
So, I need you to help me supervise him.

526
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,266
Miss An, I'll send the daily report

527
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,386
to your mailbox.

528
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:26,266
I'll upgrade the security system
as soon as possible.

529
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:28,986
I'll go to the police station after work

530
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:30,386
to see if there are any updates.

531
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:31,626
I...

532
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:34,266
I'll go with Wu.

533
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:38,786
That's great.

534
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:40,546
So go to work.

535
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:44,626
I'm leaving.

536
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:46,106
On my vacation.

537
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:50,106
Dismissed.

538
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:51,866
Dismissed, dismissed.

even on vacation.)

556
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:32,706
Dad, how come you're here?

557
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:35,026
Can I not come?

558
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:37,106
Your mother and I were both missing you.

559
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:39,946
So this is where you live?

560
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,266
Didn't I tell you?

561
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,226
Rent a better place.

562
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:49,346
Look at the bathroom and kitchen,

563
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:50,706
all connected to your bedroom.

564
00:32:50,706 --> 00:32:52,266
What's the smell of
the quilts and mattresses?

565
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:53,786
You haven't thrown the trash.

566
00:32:56,946 --> 00:32:59,346
Why don't you
open the windows for ventilation?

567
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:03,706
Have you had breakfast yet?

568
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:06,866
Why are you eating takeout again?

569
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,106
I bought it yesterday.

570
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,706
Tell me what you want to eat.

571
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:17,186
Spicy noodles.

572
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,346
Your mom has brought them for you.

573
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:23,706
The noodles will be ready in a while.

574
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:25,106
Wash up.

575
00:33:58,106 --> 00:33:59,506
Here come the noodles.

576
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:01,986
Here.

577
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,386
Eat while it's hot.

578
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:26,706
Still the same taste, right?

579
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:34,186
Take your time.

580
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:45,706
Why are you crying?

581
00:34:53,746 --> 00:34:55,346
I am here, right?

582
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:03,946
Our Ran has grown up.

583
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:06,946
If you want to
have a pair of strong wings,

584
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:10,106
you must face it with tenacity.

585
00:35:10,946 --> 00:35:12,186
These are the bumps

586
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:14,466
that one must experience in life.

587
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:19,026
I know my own daughter.

588
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:21,466
I believe in you.

589
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:27,186
Eat up.

590
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:32,546
I want to eat braised pork for lunch.

591
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:33,706
Okay.

592
00:35:35,186 --> 00:35:38,026
I will make you braised pork for lunch.

593
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:39,706
Eat up.

594
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:07,506
Ran,

595
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,706
I have a few words to say to you.

596
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:15,506
Even if you're busy at work outside,

597
00:36:16,186 --> 00:36:17,426
you can't always stay up late.

598
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:19,346
Eat less takeout.

599
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:20,986
Take good care of your health.

600
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:25,946
Here, take this.

601
00:36:25,946 --> 00:36:28,026
No, no, Dad. I can't accept this.

602
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,106
It's only natural to accept
what your parents give you.

603
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:33,146
Besides, it's not easy
being alone outside.

604
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:34,506
If you don't take this,

605
00:36:35,186 --> 00:36:36,746
can your mother rest easy?

606
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:38,666
Take it.

607
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:42,946
Rest early. I'm leaving now.

608
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:44,506
Dad, you're leaving now?

609
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:46,466
Your mother has something to do
and can't leave.

610
00:36:47,866 --> 00:36:49,266
She's also worried at home,

611
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,146
so I have to rush back

612
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:52,466
and report your situation to her.

613
00:36:53,186 --> 00:36:55,386
Then tell her
everything is fine with me.

614
00:36:55,386 --> 00:36:56,746
- Okay.
- You guys take care of yourselves.

615
00:36:58,186 --> 00:36:58,786
Alright.

616
00:36:59,186 --> 00:36:59,946
Go back.

617
00:37:06,346 --> 00:37:07,626
(We were rebellious,)

618
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:10,226
(thinking our parents' wings
were shackles.)

619
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:12,626
(After struggling to break free,)

620
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,666
(we wanted to roam freely in the world.)

621
00:37:15,746 --> 00:37:16,826
(After being whipped)

622
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:19,786
(by the harsh reality, we realized)

623
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:22,906
(that our parents are still behind us,)

624
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:24,386
(watching,)

625
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:25,826
(guarding,)

626
00:37:26,586 --> 00:37:27,506
(and protecting us.)

627
00:37:50,906 --> 00:37:53,506
Hey, old classmate. It's me, You Mai.

628
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:54,546
I know.

629
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:55,946
Are you free later?

630
00:37:55,946 --> 00:37:57,866
I invite you out for a drink. My treat.

631
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:00,466
Don't be silent.

632
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:02,746
I have something important to say.

633
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:04,546
My friends and I

634
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:07,466
are making animations.
Traditional Chinese style. It's reliable.

635
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:08,946
I'm now the sound director,

636
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:10,266
but I lack

637
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:12,426
a voice acting master like you
to do the dubbing.

638
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:13,786
What do you think? Do you want to come?

639
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:15,346
I'll pass.

640
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,706
Don't reject me so soon.

641
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:20,626
You need to do some new projects,

642
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:22,746
change your mood, and make new friends.

643
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:23,626
When you are busy,

644
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:25,506
won't you forget
all those unhappy things?

645
00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:27,786
Let me think about it.

646
00:38:28,226 --> 00:38:30,146
Alright, then I'll invite them out.

647
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:33,666
I said, "Let me think about it."

648
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:35,946
Alright, you think.

649
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,186
I'm on my way to find you.

650
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:38,026
