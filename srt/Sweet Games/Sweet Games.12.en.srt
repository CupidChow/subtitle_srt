Yes. It is on the shelf.

26

Thanks a lot.

(Chaos in Love)

37
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:26,217
The beta version was a roller coaster ride,
but in the end, it was successful.

38
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:29,257
Our official version
will be available soon.

39
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:35,137
Our animations and character designs
have received rave reviews from players.

40
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:38,257
Let's applaud Yaoyao and Peng.

41
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:40,057
Thank you all.

42
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:42,657
The credit mainly goes to Yaoyao.

43
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,777
Come on, don't be modest.
Let's drink to that.

44
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:48,817
But our storyline
needs to be more grounded.

45
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:51,497
Tian Xin and I
will continue to work on this.

46
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:52,937
- No problem.
- Changfeng.

47
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:54,657
In terms of programming,

48
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:56,417
you need to check again carefully to see

49
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:57,697
if there are any more bugs.

50
00:03:58,217 --> 00:03:59,697
- Understood.
- Wu.

51
00:04:00,217 --> 00:04:01,937
You're in charge of the interview.

52
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,297
Your find the right person.

53
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:04,657
-I'll interview them.
- Okay.

54
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:08,377
We outsourced
our promotional video as well.

55
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:10,497
It will be followed up by Mr. Hu.

56
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:13,217
Special care should be taken to
ensure the safety of our materials.

57
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,817
Why am I in charge of this?

58
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:18,697
Firstly, we're short-staffed.

59
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,257
Secondly, the more capable you are,
the more responsibility you bear.

60
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:24,057
If you put it that way, no problem.

61
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:24,937
I will do well.

62
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:26,657
I want to participate too.

63
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,097
That's great.

64
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:34,057
- Yaoyao can give professional opinions.
- I can.

65
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:37,857
Does anyone have any questions?

66
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:38,777
- No.
- No.

67
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,497
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

68
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:45,217
Thanks.

69
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,537
Three days have passed.

70
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:05,057
Mr. Hu. You fell asleep?

71
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:07,977
No, I'm working.

72
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:10,497
I'm here to talk to you
about the publicity campaign.

73
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:16,977
Why don't we have
a lunch meeting somewhere?

74
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:18,417
I don't have time.

75
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:20,537
An Ran said
the promotional video team leader

76
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:21,377
is coming.

77
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,537
There is no time to eat
because there is so much to read.

78
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:33,817
Why don't you help me read some?

79
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:35,537
Then we can discuss it later.

80
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,537
Okay, no problem.

81
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:44,537
I think we can make
some adjustments to the color.

82
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,737
What's wrong with
our current color scheme?

83
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,737
Color can convey emotion.

84
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:54,977
The colors in our promotional video now

85
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,137
are a bit too scattered.

86
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:58,617
It may cause inaccurate
emotional transmission.

87
00:05:58,777 --> 00:05:59,977
Fragment Time Boyfriend

88
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:02,057
is an uplifting game.

89
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,817
We hope that all of our players

90
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:06,457
can feel the sweetness
and warmth of love.

91
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:09,057
So I propose
that we use more warm yellow

92
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:11,497
and pink to convey this emotion.

93
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:14,577
And we want all female players

94
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:16,937
to feel immersed

95
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,337
in Fragmented Time Boyfriend.

96
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:21,057
So I propose that the style
of our promotional video

97
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:22,857
be similar to that of the game.

98
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:25,657
I will send you a sample
for your reference later.

99
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:32,317
Good job.

100
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,697
Goodbye, thank you.

101
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,937
- Happy to work with you.
- Bye.

102
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:45,177
It's getting dark.

103
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:47,817
I'm starving. Isn't it time for dinner?

104
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:51,057
You've worked hard. Enjoy your meal
and get a reimbursement invoice.

105
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:54,257
Let's eat together
and summarize the meeting's content.

106
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:58,377
What are you talking about?
Exploit workers late? It is impossible.

107
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,497
- Off duty.
- No.

108
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,097
- What I mean is...
- Get the invoice.

109
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,697
Dull.

110
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:16,737
I am worn out. That promotional
video is too much for me to handle.

111
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,177
This is the job you took on yourself.

112
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,497
I wasn't exploiting you.

113
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:23,617
I'll testify. Miss An
has been very happy recently,

114
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,057
we are all very relaxed.

115
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,497
She has no time to exploit you.

116
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,617
Isn't it? Miss An.

117
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:31,737
That is why they say love is the
nourishment of life. I am so envious.

118
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:34,177
You two... I...

119
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:36,057
I'm blushing.

120
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:39,737
I'll go get another one.

121
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,497
Sis, I have realized

122
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:46,057
that love has to be realistic.

123
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:48,417
What's wrong with you and him?

124
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,617
Look. Heisha.

125
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,937
Isn't Mr. Heisha getting too good?

126
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,497
Some people must be
very envious of you, Miss An.

127
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,177
But, while we are on the subject,

128
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:04,017
how come you have time today

129
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,257
to mingle with us singles?
Where's your boyfriend?

130
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,937
He's recording a show.

131
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:11,057
You can visit him.

132
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:16,297
That's not really good, right?
Going there would cause some havoc.

133
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,417
What if his fans are there?
That would be so embarrassing.

134
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,257
Right. I recently saw on the internet

135
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:25,937
that some fans are crazy and scary.

136
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:27,817
You two have to keep it low-key.

137
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:32,457
What will happen? Will it go public?
Will it become a hot topic?

138
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:35,577
What's there to be afraid of?
There is nothing to be afraid of.

139
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:37,857
But, An Ran, I must remind you

140
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,857
that with Yan Yue's looks,

141
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:43,177
he will undoubtedly win the hearts
of many girls once the show airs.

142
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:47,857
I'd say you should
keep a tight leash on him.

143
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:49,857
What does Miss An have to fear?

144
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,177
Where else would Mr. Heisha

145
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:53,617
find a girl as beautiful, kind,

146
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:56,617
and capable as Miss An?

147
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,617
You're a good talker.

148
00:08:58,617 --> 00:08:59,737
Have you heard?

149
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:01,617
Heisha went to record a variety show.

150
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,617
The media saw him today.

151
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:05,617
They said he's incredibly
handsome in person.

152
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:08,497
Really? I'm so envious
of those contestants.

153
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,737
I really want to see Heisha too.

154
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,097
Don't move, Mr. Heisha.

155
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:31,937
Okay, sorry.

156
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:35,857
Hey, please come out for a while.

157
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:39,057
Coming. Mr. Heisha,
please wait a moment.

158
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,497
Hello, what are you busy with?

159
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,177
Getting ready for pre-recording.

160
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:54,737
Don't be nervous.

161
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:57,057
Just take it as you speak to me.

162
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:00,617
Work might end late today.

163
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:03,737
- See you at home after you're done.
- Okay.

164
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:07,737
Wait, I have a question.

165
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,177
What do guys usually like?

166
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,297
Why are you asking this?

167
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:15,057
It is because Bai Mengyao

168
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:17,297
forced me to help her woo Hu Yingjun.

169
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:20,977
Yingjun? But I don't know what he likes.

170
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,617
Then what do you like?

171
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:26,417
I like An Ran.

172
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,097
I'm asking you seriously.

173
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:37,097
He usually likes playing games.

174
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,097
His screensaver is a game character.

175
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:45,057
Got it. Then just have
Bai Mengyao invite him to play games.

176
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,937
Okay, you get back to work.

177
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:50,337
- Good luck with the recording, bye.
- Bye.

178
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:56,977
Mr. Heisha, let's continue.

179
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:04,057
- Can I ask you a question?
- Okay.

180
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:09,177
What kind of surprises
do girls usually like?

181
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:14,057
- Mr. Heisha, don't move your head.
- Sorry.

182
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:19,297
- Mr. Heisha, get ready for recording.
- Okay.

183
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:21,897
Okay.

184
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:36,937
(If you adore him, invite him to a game.)

185
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,097
I just heard a rumor

186
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:51,577
that one of this year's
contestants is a fan of Heisha.

187
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:53,137
If so, she must have targeted Heisha.

188
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:54,217
No way.

189
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:56,577
I also heard she is only 19 years old.

190
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:57,617
19 years old?

191
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,417
I heard that she will be joining
JS Sound Art Studio later this year.

192
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,297
That's so amazing.

193
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:02,777
Yeah, so amazing,

194
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:04,457
Jiang Shan's studio?

195
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,617
I'm so envious of her.

196
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:16,915
(Heisha fan group)

197
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:24,617
What does it matter to me?

198
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:25,977
I don't care.

199
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:27,737
It has nothing to do with me.

200
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,057
But, as a girlfriend,

201
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,417
shouldn't you support

202
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,177
your boyfriend's career?

203
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,594
(Fan group application question,
Heisha's hobby)

204
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:45,042
(Camping)

205
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:48,144
(Camping
Wrong)

206
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:51,098
(Recording)

207
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,485
(Recording
Wrong)

208
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,744
(Heisha's hobby, Xiaolongbao)

209
00:12:58,657 --> 00:12:59,737
Xiaolongbao?

210
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:02,704
(Xiaolongbao)

211
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:07,649
(A Xiaolongbao)

212
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:19,056
(Heisha fan group
Heisha is so handsome!)

213
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:21,817
(Breaking news,
Heisha finished recording today.)

214
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:26,337
(He must be tired.
I want to make pear soup for Heisha.)

215
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:42,257
Mr. Heisha, you might need to
take off your headphones first.

216
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,217
We will keep them for you

217
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,337
and return them to you later.

218
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:49,936
Okay.

219
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,377
Let's start. Get ready.

220
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:57,457
Mr. Heisha, I am curious

221
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,377
what drew you

222
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:01,497
to accept our program's invitation.

223
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:04,497
Because I promised Zhou Qing.

224
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:08,257
You are free to elaborate and say more.

225
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:12,897
Actually, I have always felt that

226
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:18,017
people may overlook voice in their
daily lives, but it is all around them.

227
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:20,337
So I am hoping
that through this program,

228
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:21,897
people will be able to understand it

229
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:24,697
and hear some distinct voices.

230
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:29,057
Then, what type
of contestant in our program

231
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:30,657
are you most likely to select?

232
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,817
People who are obsessed with voice

233
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:37,377
- and love it.
- Any more?

234
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:43,057
Those who have
distinct voices and are adaptable.

235
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,777
What about other than voice?

236
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:51,057
Isn't this a voice program?

237
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:55,577
Yes, you're right,
but you can also discuss

238
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:57,777
the contestants'
characteristics, for example.

239
00:14:58,337 --> 00:14:59,897
Very humorous? Very serious?

240
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:01,257
Very good at creating atmosphere?

241
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:02,697
I don't have any thoughts about this.

242
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:07,297
I have another question.

243
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,857
Previously, you were
a mysterious voice actor

244
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:11,377
who did not reveal
your face to the public.

245
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,057
But you recently revealed your true self

246
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:16,657
at Mr. Jiang's tenth anniversary

247
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:18,897
debut reading meeting.

248
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:22,017
What made you decide to

249
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:23,377
show your face to the public?

250
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:26,297
That probably has
nothing to do with the program, right?

251
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:32,177
Yes, let's end the recording for today.

252
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,297
- Alright. Thank you, Mr. Heisha.
- Thank you.

253
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:39,177
Can I have my headphones?

254
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:40,457
Headphones.

255
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,577
- Alright.
- Thank you.

256
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,297
Why did you finish work so early today?

257
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:00,777
You must be tired.

258
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,177
- I'm not tired.
- What are you doing?

259
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:05,937
What is wrong with me carrying you?
What were you doing just now?

260
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,177
I'm preparing pear soup
for you to soothe your throat.

261
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:11,817
You can even make pear soup now.

262
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:39,657
I really miss that tent where we did

263
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:40,937
our outdoor team building.

264
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:46,057
There, we can sit quietly
and gaze at the stars

265
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:48,017
while enjoying the breeze.

266
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:52,297
We should go camping again

267
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,377
if we have time.

268
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:58,137
If we go out alone again,

269
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:01,417
I can show you how I camp.

270
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:02,937
Is it very different?

271
00:17:03,017 --> 00:17:04,017
Of course it's different.

272
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:06,057
When I go camping,

273
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:10,537
(I go to completely natural areas.)

274
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,057
(If there is time, I will go further.)

275
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:15,177
(If not, I will go closer.)

276
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:18,177
(Sometimes I listen to
the wind in the woods,)

277
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:20,897
(the sound of water, and the sound
of being blown by the night wind.)

278
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:23,057
(Listening to these sounds)

279
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,377
(is similar to listening to music.)

280
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:31,537
(Sometimes it is just to clear my mind)

281
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,257
(and not think about anything.)

282
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:35,777
(If I feel bored after a few days,)

283
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,657
(I know the city is calling me.)

284
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:42,777
(My heart's social soul
has moved again, so I am back.)

285
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,937
This is my usual camping life.

286
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:52,057
Listening to this makes me
want to sleep in a tent tonight.

287
00:17:55,537 --> 00:17:56,377
Happy to accompany.

288
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:59,057
This is my tent, who let you accompany?

289
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:04,057
- Isn't this my balcony?
- Right.

We also don't have a professional
HR person, so we don't know what to do.

- Go for it.
- Go for it.

- It's time to get off work.

Going out to play?

323
00:21:13,177 --> 00:21:14,017
Play what?

324
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:17,537
Play games.

325
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,417
Doesn't Jun like playing games the most?

326
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:20,457
Talk to me properly.

327
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:24,457
I'm losing this game because of you.

328
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:26,057
Don't play. Let's go.

329
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:28,177
You were already losing.
Look, you have already lost.

330
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:31,697
When did you start liking to play games?

331
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:35,417
Well. When playing with a pro like you,

332
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:37,817
I naturally started to like it.

333
00:21:39,377 --> 00:21:41,297
If you say so,

334
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:42,937
then teaching you is a piece of cake.

335
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:45,537
- Then let's go.
- Go where?

336
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:47,937
A good place.
You'll know when we get there.

337
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,057
Give me back my phone first.

338
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:50,457
I will return it when we arrive. Hurry.

339
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:52,177
The car I ordered is at the door.

340
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,257
What is wrong with you today?

341
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:55,177
Look, the car is there waiting for us.

342
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:56,697
What's wrong with you today?

343
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:58,177
That place is really good.

344
00:21:58,177 --> 00:21:59,057
If we are late,

345
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:00,697
it will be taken by someone else.

346
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:03,417
What's the situation?

347
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:05,417
Are they...?

348
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:07,057
Something's wrong.

349
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:08,537
Yes, indeed.

350
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:11,657
I got different information

351
00:22:11,657 --> 00:22:13,297
(App market, Mr. Wu)
than what you said.

352
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:16,457
Are you going to
change the beta version?

353
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,697
Yes, please don't hang up.

354
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:19,817

00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,297
(Is the promotional video
team urging that much?)

360
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,577
(Yes, they said they would not proceed)

361
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:41,177
- (without the money.)
- Did you send me?

362
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:46,617
I just sent you the introduction

363
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:49,017
to the entire project.
Have you received it?

364
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:52,417
(Have you seen the message yet?
Hurry up, they are urging.)

365
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:56,657
Not yet received. You just said
the plot line is being changed.

366
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,497
When will the final version be out?

367
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:02,017
Next week. Friday at the latest.

368
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:08,457
(Are you arriving?)

369
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:13,137
First, we will examine
the latest proposal.

370
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:14,937
We'll contact you if there's anything.

371
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:17,857
Okay, thank you.

372
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:25,497
(I'm almost there.)

373
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:44,377
What do girls like?
Of course it's romance.

374
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,257
The more romantic, the better.

375
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:48,417
The scene doesn't have to be big.

376
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,137
But it has to be to her liking.

377
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:05,257
(Transfer 50,000 yuan to Hu Yingjun)
(Accepted)

378
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,657
Hu Yingjun, why are they urging so much?

379
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:11,297
(You've been blocked by the receiver)

380
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:19,504
(Hu Yingjun)

381
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:22,657
Hello, Hu Yingjun, why did you block me?

382
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,417
Why would I block you?

383
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:29,777
Speak something.

384
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:31,537
- Hello.
- Hurry up.

385
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:32,657
Hello.

386
00:24:35,777 --> 00:24:37,137
If you don't speak, I'll hang up.

387
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,897
Hello, I want to report a crime.

388
00:24:56,657 --> 00:24:58,137
I think I'm being scammed.

389
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:01,777
What's the situation?

390
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:06,537
How about it? Surprised, right?

391
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:11,417
You probably rarely
visited an internet cafe.

392
00:25:11,737 --> 00:25:13,937
This place is a bit small.

393
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:15,417
How is this small?

394
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:18,417
It is ideal for two people.

395
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:21,057
This atmosphere, this lighting,

396
00:25:21,657 --> 00:25:24,777
this big screen, and me.

397
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:28,657
Is there another reason
you asked me out today?

398
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,417
- No.
- Really?

399
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:39,417
- Yes.
- All right, sit inside then.

400
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,657
No need, I'll just watch you play.

401
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:51,657
You sit here.

402
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:52,937
Sit beside me. How to watch there?

403
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:05,417
Has it started yet?

404
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:08,657
Not yet, it's updating. A new version.

405
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:14,297
Wait until the update is completed.

406
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:21,417
Shouldn't you
wear headphones? Here you go.

407
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:43,017
- Actually, I...
- What did you say?

408
00:26:50,257 --> 00:26:51,417
It's so hot.

409
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:55,137
Don't you think so?

410
00:26:57,937 --> 00:26:58,857
I'm fine.

411
00:26:58,857 --> 00:27:05,657
You... It's so hot.

412
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:10,657
I reserved this booth.
You went to the wrong booth.

413
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:13,537
No, I reserved it.

414
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:16,617
Impossible,
let's go out and talk. Come on.

415
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:22,537
Booth number three.

416
00:27:22,777 --> 00:27:23,937
It's correct. Look.

417
00:27:24,897 --> 00:27:26,137
I reserved here too.

418
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:28,897
Then you should talk to the shopkeeper.

419
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,137
We can't resolve this.

420
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:32,897
Talking to the shopkeeper is dull.

421
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:35,297
I just wanted to chat with you.

422
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:42,137
I see. Chat with my boyfriend then.

423
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:43,417
This is my boyfriend.

424
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,257
Your girlfriend?

425
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:49,137
No, colleague.

426
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:54,897
He's not your boyfriend.

427
00:27:55,497 --> 00:27:57,737
So, what are you doing here, girl?

428
00:27:57,737 --> 00:27:58,777
It's none of your business.

429
00:27:58,897 --> 00:28:01,257
You two aren't a couple.

430
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:03,417
I will book another booth.
You play with me.

431
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:06,657
Let me tell you,
speak to me respectfully.

432
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:07,657
Was I disrespectful?

433
00:28:07,657 --> 00:28:09,057
I'm pretty good at the game too.

434
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:10,137
What does your game skill

435
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:11,017
have to do with me?

436
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,657
What are you looking at?

437
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,537
You're pretty and I can't even look?

438
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,617
Hu Yingjun,
you're still playing? Come out.

439
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:20,017
He bullied me.

440
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,657
I booked this booth.

441
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:22,777
And you two are having fun.

442
00:28:22,777 --> 00:28:23,777
Who was bullied?

443
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:24,897
Are you being reasonable?

444
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:25,777
Just now I...

445
00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:27,937
Don't interfere.
Isn't this a minor issue, buddy?

446
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:29,537
We booked the same booth, right?

447
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:36,177
Here's the deal.
Book another booth, eat, drink,

448
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:37,657
and play whatever you want today,

449
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:39,017
I will pay. Is that okay?

450
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:41,137
Why should it be?

451
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,137
Just leave it to me.

452
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:44,417
Okay, buddy, you're sensible.

453
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,297
Is this amount okay?

454
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:52,137
- Hu Yingjun!
- Received?

455
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:55,777
- Buddy, is she really your girlfriend?
- No.

456
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,297
Girl, can I add you on WeChat?

457
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,417
- I'll invite you out to play later.
- Get lost.

458
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:06,137
You have quite the temper.

459
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,617
Hu Yingjun, are you an idiot?

460
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:09,177
Why are you giving him money?

461
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:12,897
What's wrong with giving money?
Money solves problems.

462
00:29:12,897 --> 00:29:13,857
It's called making peace.

463
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:15,777
Money can't solve everything.

464
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,657
Did you hear what he said about me?

465
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:19,777
Yes, I heard.

466
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:21,137
Such people can't be treated harshly.

467
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:22,297
I know you have a bad feeling.

468
00:29:22,457 --> 00:29:23,697
Let's not cause any trouble.

469
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:27,937
Who knows what he might do
if you argue with him?

470
00:29:28,657 --> 00:29:29,937
It's not your money I'm giving.

471
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,217
Isn't the problem solved now?

472
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:36,657
Go back to your game.

473
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:44,417
What day is it today?

474
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:46,057
It doesn't seem to be our birthdays.

475
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:48,257
Today marks one month

476
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:50,137
since we've been together.

477
00:30:52,697 --> 00:30:55,057
One month? Time flies.

478
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:00,777
Did you arrange all this?

479
00:31:01,857 --> 00:31:07,777
- Yes, do you like it?
- I do.

480
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:12,057
Should I start planning
for the second month's

481
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:13,657
celebration now?

482
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:16,657
Do you prefer romantic or exciting?

483
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:28,097
It's okay, you can answer it.
It's fine.

484
00:31:33,777 --> 00:31:37,137
- Hello.
- An Ran? This is the police station.

485
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:38,417
Please come and take a statement.

486
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:40,537
- Now?
- Yes, now.

487
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,417
Can I come later?

488
00:31:43,897 --> 00:31:45,017
It's best to come now.

489
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,017
Okay.

490
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:57,657
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing. Let's eat.

491
00:31:57,897 --> 00:31:58,857
Come on, eat.

492
00:32:01,657 --> 00:32:04,137
What happened? Tell me quickly.

493
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:14,737
That person isn't replying anymore.

494
00:32:23,017 --> 00:32:24,457
- What's the matter?
- Let's go.

495
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:26,137
- Where to?
- To the police station.

496
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:31,457
But you prepared so much food, all...

497
00:32:31,457 --> 00:32:33,457
It is okay. The second, third,

498
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:34,857
and fourth months are still ahead of us.

499
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:36,784
Let's go.

500
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,697
Let's go.

501
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:46,937
That's alright.

502
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:48,857
Didn't the cop just say?

503
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:51,537
You must install
the anti-fraud app. Be obedient.

504
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,017
I just feel that I'm so stupid.

505
00:32:56,937 --> 00:32:58,697
I'm already this old,

506
00:32:58,697 --> 00:33:00,177
yet I still got scammed.

507
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:10,699
(Transfer 50,000 to An Ran)

508
00:33:11,217 --> 00:33:11,977
Why?

509
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:16,457
I sent you the message,

510
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:17,977
which led to you being scammed.

511
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,657
Besides, I'm your boyfriend.

512
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,657
My money is your money.

513
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:26,537
Moreover,
isn't it my duty to protect you?

514
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:34,212
(Return Yan Yue's transfer)

515
00:33:37,657 --> 00:33:40,777
Yan Yue, I can't accept your money.

516
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:46,657
Sometimes I really envy you.

517
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:49,497
You are the type to act on whim

518
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,417
and do not worry about the consequences.

519
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:53,537
And you live very freely.

520
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:56,657
You're good at what you do.

521
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:00,177
But me?

522
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:06,857
I am an ordinary person
who is constantly falling

523
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:08,697
while pursuing my dreams.

524
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:17,657
So I'm really sad today.

525
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:21,057
I'm angry with myself.

526
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:23,697
Making money is already difficult.

527
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,457
Why would I fall for a scam?

528
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:34,777
I can't accept your money.

529
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:39,017
I should be the one
to bear this responsibility.

530
00:34:40,737 --> 00:34:42,657
Having you by my side is already great.

531
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:48,177
Okay, I got it.

532
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:54,217
My An Ran is an independent woman.

533
00:34:55,257 --> 00:34:56,537
Let's not talk about this today.

534
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:02,977
Today is a special day.

535
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:05,217
You prepared so much,

536
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:07,417
but I ruined it.

537
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:11,977
It is fine. After all,
what I did today was quite unusual.
