Now how should I

00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:01,746
combine these two characters?

40
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:05,466
The bluebird flying back and forth
is too monotonous.

41
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,026
Why not add another character?

42
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,066
More?

43
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,786
There are already eight characters.

00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,546
Where are we going to find
so many voice actors?

45
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,266
By the way, where did You Mai go?

46
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,466
Didn't he say
that the voice-over work was on him?

47
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:20,066
His little studio
has only been open for a few days.

48
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,466
I don't know
if the employees he found are reliable.

49
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:25,746
We're here.

50
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:26,546
You Mai, here.

51
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:28,546
Right here.

52
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:38,706
We're here.

53
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,266
Have a seat.

54
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:42,306
Thank you.

55
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:43,586
Why are you all standing here?

56
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:44,066
Sit.

57
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,026
Have a seat.

58
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,186
Let me introduce you.

59
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,266
This is my college classmate,

60
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,026
voiceover master, Yan Yue.

61
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,346
Super capable.

62
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,026
I invited him
to do voice-overs for our animation.

63
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,586
They are the ones I told you about.

64
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,266
The members of our animation team.

65
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,396
This is Lin Ran,

66
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:03,186
Bluebird's planner,
producer and director.

67
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,706
This is Mengmeng, our screenwriter.

68
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:07,706
And Xiao Yuan, our illustrator.

69
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:09,426
Hello, master.

70
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:12,026
Now our "Bluebird" is saved.

71
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:13,306
Great, You Mai.

72
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:14,866
Complete the mission successfully.

73
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:18,586
Your friend is really handsome.

74
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:19,986
He's my type.

75
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:22,866
Let's talk about work.

76
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:24,706
It's not conflicting.

77
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:27,786
Yan Yue, right?

78
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,986
What are you doing here?

79
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:32,466
Distracting myself.

80
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,066
How long do you plan to do so?

81
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:36,586
Haven't decided yet.

82
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:38,706
What's your sign?

83
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:40,146
What do you usually like to do?

84
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:41,306
By the way,

85
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,026
what kind of girls do you like?

86
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:45,306
Aren't we here to talk about animation?

87
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,746
Right, right. Let's talk about it.

88
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:50,026
Screenwriter, share our story with him.

89
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,306
Our "Bluebird"

90
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,746
is based on love mythology.

91
00:04:55,186 --> 00:05:00,306
The bluebird is
the mythical messenger of love,

92
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:03,186
which can convey longing between lovers.

93
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,306
But the bluebird in our story

94
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,186
is different.

95
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,906
Our protagonist is a little bluebird
that doesn't understand love

96
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,186
or longing.

97
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:14,026
While delivering letters to a lover,

98
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:16,466
it experiences love and separation.

99
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:19,066
Eventually, it understands what love

100
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,346
and longing are.

101
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,306
Yan Yue, what do you think of the setup?

102
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,306
Yan Yue?

103
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,146
Master?

104
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,186
Well, I've roughly understood
the plot and setup.

105
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,746
Which character
do you want me to voice over?

106
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,586
You can do whichever you want.

107
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,266
If you're willing to do more,

108
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:43,186
that would be great.

109
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:43,986
Best.

110
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:45,426
Best.

111
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,024
(Voice Studio)

112
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:10,466
Does Miss Jasmine still live in town?

113
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,466
(Voice over content)

114
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,586
I've been entrusted by someone

115
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:13,706
and flew from across the sea

116
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:17,026
to deliver something
called "longing" to her.

117
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:19,306
But

118
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,426
how would the sea breeze know?

119
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,866
Not at all.

120
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:24,706
Wind chimes never lie.

121
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,146
Master is indeed a master.

122
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:32,266
Look, he can voice over
two characters easily.

123
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:35,466
The person I've found.
In one word, reliable.

124
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:39,106
Yan Yue.

125
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:41,626
Could you do the last line again?

126
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:43,226
This time, could you make it
more energetic?

127
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,426
Okay.

128
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:44,986
Alright.

129
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:47,866
Lin Ran.

130
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:49,986
Lin Ran.

131
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:52,666
When are those two voice-over actors

132
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,626
you found coming?

133
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:55,226
Yeah.

134
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:58,186
I'll give them a call.

135
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,226
What is longing?

136
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,546
Sea Breeze says
it will blow people's thoughts,

137
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,746
and see what they are thinking
and longing for.

138
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:07,426
Thank you, Yan Yue.

139
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:09,186
Impressive.

140
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:11,746
Oh, my.

141
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:12,746
What's wrong?

142
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,866
They're not coming.

143
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,306
How could they do this?

144
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,426
Doing whatever they want.

145
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:22,746
Where can we find

146
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,666
other voice actors at the last minute?

147
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:27,186
We have to deliver it in three days.

148
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:28,106
You Mai,

149
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:30,506
can you contact other voice actors?

150
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:32,746
It's not a matter of money now.

151
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,626
I can use my own money now.

152
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:37,186
There's still a problem.
We only have one or two days left.

153
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,626
Even if I work as busy as a bee,

154
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,866
I can't finish the post-production.

155
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:40,306
Right.

156
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:41,066
You Mai,

157
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,426
can you find anyone else?

158
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,426
Didn't they promise us at the time?

159
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:47,986
Now is not the time to reason with them.

160
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,626
This is the fruit of
two years of our labors.

161
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:53,866
We've already overcome
so many difficulties.

162
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,626
I don't want to give up like this.

163
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,066
Alright, alright, let's find a solution.

164
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,506
Why do you continue since it's so hard?

165
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:10,546
Because they are waiting for me
to pay their salaries.

166
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:11,946
Them?

167
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,666
They said

168
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:17,306
dreams are expensive in this city.

169
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,426
I think they're right.

170
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:36,866
I'll voice over
the other characters as well.

171
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,066
You've heard it all?

172
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:44,746
Yan Yue.

173
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,746
But we still have six characters.

174
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:51,306
And one of them has a lot of lines.

175
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:55,106
Let me try.

176
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:58,306
The number of the lines
of the other characters combined

177
00:08:58,946 --> 00:08:59,986
is actually about the same

178
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:01,626
as that of the two characters
I voiced today combined.

179
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,546
By pulling an all-nighter,
we can get it done before dawn.

180
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,986
Are you willing to help us, Yan Yue?

181
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:15,546
I just

182
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,946
don't want to see your efforts wasted.

183
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,186
My buddy.

184
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:23,106
Reliable, right?

185
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:23,746
Reliable.

186
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:57,226
Feelings

187
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,226
and longing,

188
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:00,426
endless as they are.

189
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:18,986
Thank you, Yan Yue.

190
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:19,826
Thank you.

191
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,066
No need for thanks.
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

192
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:24,186
If time isn't so tight,

193
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,226
actually, there's a lot of room
for improvement.

194
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,186
It's already exceeded our expectations,

195
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,546
but I didn't expect

196
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,186
that you would help us voluntarily.

197
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,866
Come on, breakfast is here.

198
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:35,546
Thank you, Director Lin.

199
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,746
It's not for you.

200
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,626
Yan Yue, I don't know what you like,

201
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:42,626
so I bought various breakfast.

202
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:47,626
I don't have much appetite. I'll pass.

203
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,866
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

204
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,746
Your headphones are so beautiful.

205
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:03,546
I'll take my leave.

206
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:04,986
Yan Yue.

207
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:07,826
See you tomorrow.

208
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:19,426
So hot.

209
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:25,986
Stop daydreaming.

210
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:27,386
Call them to come and eat.

211
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,546
Let's eat.

212
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:38,546
Come in.

213
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:45,826
Mr. Hu.

(Application for Resignation)

215
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:54,666
W-What do you mean?

216
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:56,426
I want to resign.

217
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:06,986
Please sit.

218
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:09,186
Sit.

219
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:13,186
Listen to me.

220
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,866
I know the wages aren't high now,

221
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:17,546
but we've already had an investment.

222
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,186
The project will definitely
get bigger and bigger.

223
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,306
As you're an old employee,

224
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,186
we'll definitely give you...

225
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,186
By then...

226
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:23,546
It's not about the salary.

227
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:27,626
I might

228
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:29,746
not be suitable for this company.

229
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:37,426
Did someone bully you?

230
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:38,746
Did they ostracize you?

231
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:39,546
They didn't invite you?

232
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,066
No, no.

233
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:42,866
They are kind to me.

234
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,866
I just want to go back to my hometown.

235
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:47,546
Back to your hometown?

236
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:52,426
I want to change careers.

237
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:17,186
Chen Rui,

238
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,746
why are you suddenly packing up?

239
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:23,306
What's wrong?

240
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:24,666
What's happening?

241
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:27,426
I plan to resign.

242
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:28,986
Why do you want to leave?

243
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:30,106
You didn't know?

244
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:32,826
It's out of sudden.

245
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:33,986
Yes.

246
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:36,546
During this time,

247
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,106
thank you for taking care of me.

248
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:06,106
We lost one more.

249
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:10,226
This is a sign of doom.

250
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:11,306
Knock the wood.

251
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:12,426
What a crow's beak.

252
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,986
Hu Yingjun is indeed unreliable.

253
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,546
He didn't even try to retain her.

254
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,546
Actually, I've recently noticed Chen Rui

255
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:24,186
doesn't seem quite herself

256
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:26,186
like she's preoccupied.

257
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:29,306
Did she meet any difficulties?

258
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:32,746
Did someone bully her?

259
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:34,186
Possible.

260
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:39,626
What are you doing?

261
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:41,866
Why are you all looking at me?

262
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:43,306
I'm so kind.

263
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:44,746
If you go on like this,

264
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,186
be careful I might
leave in a huff as well.

265
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:52,666
Childish.

266
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,186
But then again,

267
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,306
I can understand why Chen Rui left.

268
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:01,306
After all, our company
is in dire straits.

269
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:04,106
But I don't think Chen Rui
is that kind of person.

270
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:07,186
But with Chen Rui gone,

271
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,546
our company's marketing department

272
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:11,106
disbanded on the spot.

273
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,866
And she taught me a lot too.

274
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:18,346
Alright,

275
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,106
let's go.

276
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:20,106
Back to work.

277
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:21,706
Once a person leaves,

278
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:22,626
there's more work.

279
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:24,346

has brought about significant progress.

342
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:27,586
I was worrying about you at home.

343
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:29,226
I was afraid you wouldn't want to talk,

344
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,706
yet also afraid you'd be too pent up.

345
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:35,106
So, I brought you
a bag of skincare products.

346
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:36,946

00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,346
It's not bad.

351
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:47,826
No, it's not.

352
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:49,346
You must have not moved on.

353
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:50,346
Let's have a drink.

354
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:51,106
Let's have a drink.

355
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:51,586
And talk.

356
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:52,266
Let's go.

357
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:52,746
I'm not drinking.

358
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:53,586
Let's go.

359
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:57,586
Come on.

360
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:07,106
Tell me.

361
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:08,986
You've been busy all these years,

362
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:10,826
and now that you've suddenly stopped,

363
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,346
you don't know what to do, right?

364
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:19,346
Haven't you thought about
going home for a few days?

365
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:20,946
After all, your parents are there.

366
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:28,226
Let me tell you something
that's really embarrassing.

367
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,106
Just a few days ago,

368
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:32,226
my dad came.

369
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,706
He came to give me money.

370
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:38,466
He probably guessed
that our company was in trouble,

371
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:40,466
and didn't know
how to bring it up with me.

372
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:41,706
He just put a bank card

373
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,346
in my hand and left.

374
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,346
That felt pretty bad, didn't it?

375
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,706
I was reminded of
when I first started my business.

376
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,946
I was afraid to see my parents.

377
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:58,466
I was afraid

378
00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:00,346
that they would nag me to go home.

379
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:02,466
I was even more afraid of them
forcing me to get married.

380
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:04,826
In short, we'd end up arguing
at the drop of a hat.

381
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,106
When I talked to them about my dreams,

382
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:08,346
they didn't understand.

383
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:10,706
I even felt that
I was being melodramatic.

384
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:14,586
Anyway, that's why
I avoided them for a few years.

385
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:17,826
I didn't like going home either.

386
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:20,226
I always felt

387
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:22,866
it was not time to return home in glory.

388
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:24,586
And do you know

389
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:27,946
my parents said they wanted
to visit me a few days ago?

390
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:29,946
I didn't let them come.

391
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,306
I was thinking

392
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:33,826
I must make some achievements

393
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,106
before I let them come.

394
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:41,946
When I went home
for the new year last year,

395
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,586
I suddenly noticed they were different.

396
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:47,226
They didn't care

397
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:48,706
how my job was going,

398
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:50,586
or how much money I made.

399
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:52,346
They only cared

400
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:54,466
if I was doing well.

401
00:21:58,226 --> 00:21:59,986
Maybe it's because
they're getting older.

402
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:03,586
Now I often think about them.

403
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:09,106
As for Yan Yue,

404
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:11,226
do you plan to tell them?

405
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,706
Just forget about it.

406
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,106
Don't add to their burdens.

407
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:20,466
I'm in my thirties now,

408
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:23,346
but I am still learning
how to be a good daughter.

409
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,106
Let's report the good news
and not the bad.

410
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:30,346
An Ran,

411
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,066
are you really alright?

412
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:44,106
What's with

413
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:45,946
Yan Yue exactly?

414
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:48,186
Where has he gone without a word?

415
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:49,946
He went too far.

416
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:55,826
Have you tried to find him?

417
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,826
Here, drink.

418
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:11,986
Let's not talk about this.

419
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,186
Tell me

420
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,706
how the company is doing recently.

421
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:19,346
You are still thinking about work?

422
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:22,706
Any clues about the hackers?

423
00:23:24,706 --> 00:23:25,466
No.

424
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:28,706
Changfeng has been tracking for days

425
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:30,346
but still hasn't caught any trace.

426
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:31,986
I think

427
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:35,346
only relying on
technical tracking won't work.

428
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:44,226
We could try to
expand the scope of the clues.

429
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:51,346
(When you truly
experience what longing is,)

430
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,826
(he will come to your side.)

431
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:55,106
(Sir,)

432
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:57,466
(does the bluebird
really exist in the world?)

433
00:23:58,986 --> 00:24:01,706
Prince Charming's voice sounds so good.

434
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,466
So many voices,

435
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:04,946
each with its own charm.

436
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:06,586
Fantastic.

437
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:09,706
Why hasn't he debuted?

438
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:11,346
What do you know?

439
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:14,586
But I lost something.

440
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:16,346
Should we

441
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:17,706
modify it?

442
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:19,706
Why?

443
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:21,946
Even his dry voice

444
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,826
is attractive.

445
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:24,826
Lady,

446
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,946
Xiao Yuan is talking about the scene.

447
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:27,946
Scene.

448
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:29,346
Can't you be serious?

449
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:31,946
Scene.

450
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,346
Yes, it needs adjusting.

451
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:34,826
H-Hurry and adjust it.

452
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,904
(Concern from Hu Yingjun)

453
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,186
It's all right.

454
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:43,866
We made it.

455
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:44,626
We did it.

456
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:47,866
Finally succeeded.

457
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:49,306
I suggest

458
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:50,706
we must celebrate today.

459
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:51,626
(Because my stay)

460
00:24:52,306 --> 00:24:53,346
(would only affect her.)

461
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:53,946
Fried chicken.

462
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:54,306
Fried chicken.

463
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,106
I'll listen to them.

464
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:56,066
Whatever.

465
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,546
To "Bluebird".

466
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:03,826
Dig in.

467
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:04,546
Come on, Yan Yue,

468
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:05,626
eat more.

469
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:06,586
Okay.

470
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:08,346
I'll try this first.

471
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:12,466
It's good.

472
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:14,466
Why are you even guarding the food?

473
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,986
Keep nice things right in front of you?

474
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:16,626
Wait.

475
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:17,946
Who's guarding food?

476
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:19,706
Enjoy.

477
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:21,466
Were you

478
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,746
very popular at school, Yan Yue?

479
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:24,106
No.

480
00:25:25,186 --> 00:25:26,546
Don't believe him. He's being modest.

481
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:28,426
I remember when I first met him,

482
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,946
his hands were tired
from receiving love letters.

483
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:32,346
Did you

484
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:33,466
have a girlfriend in college?

485
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:37,706
Let me think about this for him.

486
00:25:38,986 --> 00:25:40,106
I remember

487
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,986
he was always alone,

488
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:44,186
and he loved going to the library.

489
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:46,466
I don't know what he was doing there.

490
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:47,586
In Broadcasting Department,

491
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:49,626
they don't need to
be in the library all the time.

492
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:51,746
But I've never seen him
in a relationship.

493
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:53,186
I thought

494
00:25:53,306 --> 00:25:55,746
he had seen through the world
at a young age.

495
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:56,866
And, I was really...

496
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:57,746
What about now?

497
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:58,746
Do you have a girlfriend?

498
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:08,186
I vote for him having one.

499
00:26:08,186 --> 00:26:09,826
I saw his previous Moments

500
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:11,586
full of love, which made me jealous.

501
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:12,866
What Moments?

502
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,306
I didn't see it.

503
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:15,826
Show us.

504
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,186
Why should I show you?

505
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:18,546
Stingy.

506
00:26:18,546 --> 00:26:20,226
You think I can't
collect information on my own?

507
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:20,866
Alright, alright.

508
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:21,466
You can.

509
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:23,466
There are so many girls in this world.

510
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:25,946
Maybe this person is right beside you.

511
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:28,986
Close at hand.

512
00:26:29,826 --> 00:26:30,546
Lin Ran.

513
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:31,306
Lin Ran.

514
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:32,826
Don't be stunned. Toast.

515
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:33,586
Cheers.

516
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,826
Cheers.

517
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:37,346
Sorry,

518
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:38,826
I have something to do. I have to go.

519
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:40,066
Wait,

520
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:41,346
Yan Yue.

521
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:42,746
Bro.

522
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:43,826
Yan Yue!

523
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:44,746
Yan...

524
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,346
What's going on?

525
00:26:48,426 --> 00:26:49,706
You shouldn't bring it up.

526
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:51,066
Dig in.

527
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:52,866
Stop looking.

528
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,106
Hacker attack.

529
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:18,800
(Heisha's Recordings)

530
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:33,026
As long as I haven't finished
the wishes I owe you,

531
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,386
I will stay with you.

532
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:37,026
Answer your summon,

533
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,386
and appear at any time.

534
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,906
But you don't have to worry.

535
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:42,666
If you encounter danger,

536
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,266
I'll accompany you,

537
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:46,466
and fight side by side with you.

538
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,266
On this lonely night,

539
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:51,266
I hope that you, busy as you are,

540
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:53,626
have an extra hour of love every day.

I wonder what

586
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,026
brings Mr. Zhao here this time.

587
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:14,386
He wants to acquire us.

588
00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:25,666
Hey, Tian Xin,

589
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:26,746
are you free now?

590
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:28,746
There's something
I need to discuss with you in person.

591
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,346
Miss An,

592
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:39,266
what's wrong? Is there anything?

593
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:40,626
Why did you call us over urgently?

594
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:41,746
No need to take out computer.

595
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,106
I just want to ask

596
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:44,986
how the company is doing recently.

597
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:47,266
Chen Rui left.

598
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:48,956
Chen Rui left?

599
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:51,106
She said the work was too tiring.

600
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,866
She wants to go back home and rest.

601
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:54,546
Is she coming back then?

602
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:57,226
She probably won't come back.

603
00:31:59,266 --> 00:31:59,906
By the way, Miss An,

604
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:02,626
what's the matter?
You're in such a hurry.

605
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:03,266
You haven't said it yet.

606
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:05,346
I called you here

607
00:32:05,346 --> 00:32:07,026
to ask you for a favor.

608
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,546
Help me investigate

609
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:10,986
Gaishi Group's acquisitions
over the past decade.

610
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:13,066
In fact, I've already asked Wu

611
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,466
to have his friend to help.

612
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,146
But I have to rely on you for the rest.

613
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:17,466
No problem.

614
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:20,026
But why suddenly investigate this?

615
00:32:21,346 --> 00:32:24,466
Right now, we can't
directly track the hacker.

616
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:27,066
But I've been investigating
for the past ten years,

617
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:29,506
the companies that have had
the same experiences as us.

618
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:33,186
I noticed that several of them
were acquired by Gaishi Group

619
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:35,146
shortly after the incidents occurred.

620
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:37,666
What a coincidence, right?

621
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:38,986
Not at all a coincidence.

622
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:40,306
Trust me,

623
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:41,586
they definitely did it on purpose.

624
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:44,586
So let's not tell anyone for now.

625
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:47,466
The most important thing
is to find the evidence.

626
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:52,026
Tian Xin, assist Changfeng.

627
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:54,746
Let's do more research
and look up some information.

628
00:32:55,146 --> 00:32:56,506
First, tell me the results.

629
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:57,466
Then we'll make plans.

630
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:58,306
Okay.

631
00:32:58,306 --> 00:32:58,746
Yes.

632
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:24,306
Yan Yue.

633
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:27,386
Yan Yue.

634
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:44,306
Why didn't you go to the premiere?

635
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:45,986
I was sleeping.

636
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:46,986
You...

637
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:49,306
Yan Yue, are you sick?

638
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:51,386
I'm fine.

639
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:55,346
I came to tell you good news.

640
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:58,106
Today, "Bluebird"
was screened at Lin Ran's school.

641
00:34:58,106 --> 00:34:59,306
The response was very good.

642
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:01,826
Congrats to you guys.

643
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:03,826
We made this film ourselves.

644
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:04,746
Why are you congratulating us?

645
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:07,306
Our teacher

646
00:35:07,386 --> 00:35:09,466
is a weird old man
who never praises anyone.

647
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:10,466
But after watching the movie,

648
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:11,226
he asked me

649
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:13,586
where I found
such an excellent voice actor.

650
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,346
Now everyone in our school

651
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:16,626
is asking me about you.

652
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:18,586
You didn't tell them my name, did you?

653
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:20,146
Don't worry.

654
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:21,826
I told her not to tell anyone.

655
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:22,906
And another thing.

656
00:35:23,146 --> 00:35:25,066
Bluebird is going to participate in
the online animation competition.

657
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,106
We have a great chance
of being nominated.

658
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:31,266
You'd better remove my name.

659
00:35:31,906 --> 00:35:32,666
Why?

660
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:38,386
Yan Yue.

661
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:41,346
Are you okay?

662
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:45,106
You have a fever.

663
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:08,386
You're awake.

664
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:17,826
Take the medicine first.

665
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:25,066
Thank you.

666
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:37,266
Why haven't you gone home yet?

667
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:38,866
You...

668
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:40,626
Are you still not feeling well?

669
00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:42,986
I'm fine now.

670
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,906
I was planning
to ask you to a play today.

671
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:53,586
Let's do it next time.

672
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:56,386
Where is You Mai?

673
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:57,626
You Mai.

674
00:36:58,866 --> 00:36:59,746
He

675
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:01,346
fell asleep outside.

676
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:09,346
By the way,

677
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:11,106
you said earlier

678
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,306
to remove your name
from "Bluebird" for the competition.

679
00:37:13,626 --> 00:37:14,226
Why?

680
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,066
I don't want any unnecessary trouble.

681
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:19,866
Why would there be unnecessary trouble?

682
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,306
You have so many questions.

683
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:26,866
Is it because of your ex-girlfriend?

684
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:34,586
You Mai said
you might have a girlfriend.

685
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:37,066
But you might have broken up.

686
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:38,666
I'm really curious

687
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,666
what kind of girl you like.

688
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:44,346
You really have a lot of questions.

689
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:47,146
So,

690
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,986
can I pursue you?

691
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:04,866
(Welcome to)

692
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,826
