(To be precise,)

(the premise of security is)

27
00:02:10,594 --> 00:02:12,434
(that you have a safety line.)

(Inside the line, you are free.)

29
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:18,714
(Outside the line, you are at a loss.)

30
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:22,314
Standards for safety lines vary widely.

31
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:25,434
Some people have strange safety lines.

32
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:33,394
(I thought being afraid of the dark)

33
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,714
(was an old routine in a romance novel.)

00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,754
(But some people feel safer with light.)

35
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:47,794
(Some feel safer without sharp things.)

36
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,834
(And some feel safer)

37
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:58,434
(when discarding old stuff.)

Do you have any questions
about today's investment plan

for new energy appliances?

45
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:35,274
I have no problem.

46

Cindy, you take the team to follow up.

47
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:38,234
Okay.

48
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:39,594
That's all for today's meeting.

I have many things to be familiar with
since I just joined the company.

It's great to work with you all.

53
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,234
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

54
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,234
Mr. Pei.

55
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,354
I have prepared the car for you

56
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:57,434
to attend the summit tonight.

57
00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:58,954
Okay, thank you.

58
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:13,634
Be serious.

59
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:14,954
You're rising.

60
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,234
You should take on good projects.

61
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:18,434
But you don't even care.

62
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,234
Now I can only ask Shan for help.

63
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:24,074
I have to take your uninterested jobs.

64
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:25,794
It's signed by Shan.

65
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:26,994
Let him sign it himself.

66
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,034
Are you kidding?

67
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,994
Nan and I have reviewed this project.

68
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:31,714
Not bad.

69
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:35,314
Just read it.

70
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:37,674
No, I'm not interested.

71
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:38,594
Come on.

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,944
Have a quick read.

73
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:48,594
Have you ever seen such a good idea?

Tianqi Culture.

78
00:04:58,554 --> 00:04:59,634
Doesn't it say so on it?

79
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:05,274
We have another good project

80
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:06,474
called Treasure Pavilion.

81
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,914
We've already started bidding.

82
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:09,034
This project is much larger

83
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:10,874
than the previous ones.

84
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:14,034
I think your team is very creative.

85
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:16,714
Are you interested in the bid?

86
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:19,754
I'm working overtime
for Wang's bidding project.

87
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,914
I'm not in the mood to play today.
You play by yourself.

88
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:23,874
What should I do with this proposal?

89
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:26,994
Can I see your demonstration document?

00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:37,274
There's a problem with this project.

92
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:43,634
What's wrong with it?

93
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,274
I've checked it many times with them.

94
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:48,434
Nan.

95
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:51,714
Do me a favor.

96
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:55,874
Hello, Mr. Liu.

97
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:57,994
Our studio's voice actor wants

98
00:05:58,114 --> 00:05:59,834
to meet with you.

99
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:02,554
No.

100
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:03,874
The point is,

101
00:06:04,274 --> 00:06:05,874
the more details they know,

102
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,834
the more creative he will be.

103
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,354
It's good for his dubbing work.

104
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:14,394
Okay, see you later.

105
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,954
Okay, bye.

106
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:20,114
Done.

How's the balance-sheets this month?

108
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,514
(Missed Call Yan Yue)
More spending than last month.

109
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:29,034
We're about to overspend.

110
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:30,354
Has the final payment been settled?

111
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:33,514
I have already given them the invoice.

112
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:35,344
But they have not paid yet.

113
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:37,434
He's tricky.

114
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:39,874
I'll go find him again tomorrow.

115
00:06:40,114 --> 00:06:43,874
Miss An, you've already talked
to him many times.

116
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:46,354
And they made us lose the bid

117
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:47,834
for Treasure Pavilion.

118
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,554
Should we...

119
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:54,834
We can't be against them.

120
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,074
We don't have enough evidence.

121
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:59,954
We might not win even if we sue them.

122
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:03,514
Let me think of another way.

123
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,394
What's wrong with Tian Xin?

124
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,994
I asked her when I left work last night.

125
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:14,634
She said she was fine.

126
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,274
Look at her. Does she look okay?

127
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:20,394
She's absent-minded every day.

128
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,074
She can't even hear you.

129
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:24,394
I don't know what happened.

130
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:28,954
How's your alcohol tolerance?

131
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:31,120
Look at you. Why are you so nervous?

132
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:33,914
I hope I can handle
all projects with you.

133
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:41,264

What's going on?

140
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:14,354
What's wrong?

00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:14,874
What's wrong?

What's going on?

00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:17,354
What's wrong?

144
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:18,754
Why are you crying?

145
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:20,514
Why are you crying?

146
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:21,554
What happened, Tian Xin?

147
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:32,880
He keeps sending me messages

148
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:36,114
and some weird pictures.

149
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:38,194
A few days ago,

150
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,234
he asked me out for a drink

151
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,194
in his house.

152
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,554
But I'm afraid it will affect
our project if I don't go.

153
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,368
How can you be so silly?

154
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:50,794
How cheeky!

155
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,074
How dare he.

156
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,394
Does he think he can walk all over us?

157
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:55,394
We must take revenge.

158
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:57,074
What should we do?

159
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,514
He will attend
the industry summit tonight.

160
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:04,194
Industry leaders will be there.

161
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:05,634
I can get the invitation.

162
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:08,394
Deal with him.

163
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:09,234
Do it.

164
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:13,074
An Ran is with you?

165
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:14,634
We're going
to settle accounts with Wang.

166
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,354
Isn't she sick? How?

167
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,074
The address.

168
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:18,394
Why are you coming?

169
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:19,474
Send it to me.

170
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:20,514
Alright.

171
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:21,874
I gotta go.

172
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,394
You need help.

173
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:34,714
Why didn't you come to me?

174
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:38,154
Mr. Wang, the project
has been handed over to Mr. Zhang.

175
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:41,874
But I want
to hand this project over to you.

176
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:45,754
It is a key project.

177
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:48,194
Girls should learn

178
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:51,594
to use their own advantages.

179
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,274
Understand?

180
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:53,794
Mr. Wang.

181
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:55,754
What are you doing?

182
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,434
What are you doing?

183
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:00,954
Heisha.

184
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,074
Do you have any shame?

185
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:05,154
What do you mean?

186
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,394
You explain to me

187
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:09,296
why Gaishi Unparalleled's game plan

188
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,074
is in the proposal of another company?

189
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,314
Stay out of this.

190
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:17,714
You used connections

191
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:19,514
to plagiarize An Ran's plan.

192
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:21,834
You must explain it to me today.

193
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,394
Who do you think you are?

194
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:26,594
It's none of your business.

195
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,634
Aren't you just a voice actor?

196
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,194
I can blacklist you. Got it?

197
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:31,394
And An Ran,

198
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,274
you two take yourselves too seriously.

199
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,514
Hey, what are you doing?

200
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:57,394
You send messages to girls
in the middle of the night

201
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:58,874
and harass girls.

202
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,274
You think

203
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:01,434
you can do whatever you want?

204
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:02,834
You try to be a scum

205
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,434
instead of a decent person?

206
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:06,834
Beauty,

207
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:09,634
show me your evidence.

208
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:11,194
Shame on you.

209
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:14,954
Open your eyes.

210
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,314
Look.

211
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:19,154
So what? Is this illegal?

212
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:20,834
How dare you say that

213
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,274
after this?

214
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:24,714
You think you're handsome?

215
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:27,874
In this case,

216
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,714
I don't think you want to do business

217
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:31,834
and the final payment, right?

218
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:34,154
You know you haven't paid yet, huh?

219
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,954
Don't try to threaten me with this.

220
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:38,634
I'm telling you.

221
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,194
Even if I can't get the final payment,

222
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:43,634
I will seek justice for my colleague.

223
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:44,834
And,

224
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:47,154
I will let everyone in the industry

225
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,274
know your disgusting behavior.

226
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,594
I'm so scared.

227
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:53,744
Here's the evidence.

228
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,074
Why is your company's project plan

229
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:56,834
exactly the same

230
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,154
as Gaishi Unparalleled's?

231
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:03,474
It cannot be used as evidence.

232
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,154
This is just a coincidence.

233
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,594
What does it have to do with me?

234
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:09,714
Listen to this.

235
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:11,234
Mr. Liu,

236
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:13,674
we're interested
in your project, Treasure Pavilion.

237
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:15,714
But we're afraid of wasting time.

238
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:18,874
So we want to know if it is reliable.

239
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:20,314
Don't worry.

240
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:23,074
The CEO of Tiansheng Corp
gave me this project.

241
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:23,914
A good project.

242
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:25,914
Let me tell you a secret.

243
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:28,514
Mr. Wang of Tiansheng
is my brother-in-law.

244
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:30,594
This case is already mature.

245
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,176
You guys think about it.

246
00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:34,192
That's it.

247
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:35,714
You scum.

248
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,314
You harass my workmate
and plagiarize my plan.

249
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:39,634
I will beat you up.

250
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:43,314
We can call the police now

251
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:45,154
unless you agree to a few conditions.

252
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:49,274
First, publicly apologize
to the girls you have harassed.

253
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:52,754
Second, pay the planning fee
of Treasure Pavilion to them.

254
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:57,714
Third, settle the final payment
of Gaishi Unparalleled.

255
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:09,834
I promise you.

256
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:18,434
Why did you stop me?

257
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,114
Why not knock him down with one punch?

258
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:23,274
Well,

259
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:24,634
I must share the good news

260
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:26,434
of defeating him with everyone.

261
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,274
Oh, we should check on Tian Xin.

262
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:29,074
I'm leaving.

263
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:29,714
Okay, goodbye.

264
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:30,514
Goodbye.

265
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:35,514
Are you okay?

266
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:38,634
How come you're here?

267
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:40,394
I asked Hu Yingjun.

268
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:42,154
I came to help.

269
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:48,034
You were quite brave just now.

270
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:50,754
Good thing you guys arrived in time.

271
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:54,314
An Ran.

272
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:57,104
Miss Lan, you're here too.

273
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:01,034
I really didn't expect

274
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:03,554
he was that kind of person.

275
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:07,074
You saw it?

276
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:11,314
I respected him in this industry.

277
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:14,074
None of us expected it.

278
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,634
But much to my surprise,

279
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:17,954
you are so brave

280
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:20,194
that you can meddle in such things.

281
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:23,154
It's what I should do.

282
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:28,434
I remember you were working on a project

283
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,674
called Fragment Time Boyfriend.

284
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:32,554
Is it still going on?

285
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:35,354
Yes, it is.

286
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,474
And we updated the character design
a few days ago.

287
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:39,674
Would you mind showing it to me?

288
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,434
Great, I'll send it to you tomorrow.

289
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:43,474
Okay.

290
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,474
Miss Lan.

291
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,674
You came just in time.

292
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,994
Let me introduce him to you.

293
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:56,434
This is our new director
at Lansheng Investment,

294
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:57,714
Pei Jun.

295
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:00,234
This is An Ran from Gaishi Unparalleled.

296
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:01,874
You guys get to know each other.

297
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:04,194
Miss An.

298
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:19,554
An Ran, if you need anything,

299
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:20,914
just go directly to Mr. Pei.

300
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,034
He is in charge of investment
in small and medium-sized enterprises.

301
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:28,114
Miss An will have a cooperation with us.

302
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,314
I hope you two work well.

303
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:30,554
Don't worry, Miss Lan.

304
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:32,354
Then I'll go in first.

305
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:33,554
You two can talk.

306
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:43,914

329
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:54,514
I see.

332
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,834
We need to wait for the report.

333
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,424
You rest for a while.

334
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:20,674
Or let's not wait.

335
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:22,154
Let's just go home.

336
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:23,674
It's reassuring to know the result.

337
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:25,034
Hang in there.

338
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,914

339
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,674

00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,114
It's nothing.

00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,594
I don't like arguing.

When I hear others arguing,

343
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:50,864
I will get uncomfortable.

344
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:58,074
It's okay
if you don't want to talk about it.

345
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:01,994
Don't talk about me.

346
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:03,314
Are you feeling better?

347
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,434
I think so.

348
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,394
Much better.

349
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,034

00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:18,714

352
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,114
I'll go get the report.

353
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:36,314
Okay.

354
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:37,194

No need.

00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:28,834
Your medicine.

377
00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:34,834
Thank you for today.

378
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:35,914
Good night.

379
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:37,034
Good night.

380
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:32,914
See you.

381
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,394
Thank you all.

382
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,314
Hi, I really like your painting.

383
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:46,554
Can we make friends?

384
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:47,994
My name is Pei Jun.

385
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:49,834
My name is An Ran.

386
00:22:58,554 --> 00:22:59,634
(It often happens.)

387
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,554
(When we fall in love,)

388
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,280
(we will be at a loss.)

389
00:23:04,994 --> 00:23:07,314
(Dopamine pushes us
beyond our comfort zone.)

390
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:10,754
(But at certain moments,)

391
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:14,114
(we realize all our confidence)

392
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:15,714
(is just an illusion.)

393
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:19,194
(Advancing or retreating,)

394
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:22,594
(there's no proper distance.)

395
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:31,194
What am I doing?

396
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,794
Get in the car. I can give you a lift.

397
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,034
I'm taking the bus today.

398
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:53,634
I'm going to the other direction.

399
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:55,154
So I won't be going with you.

400
00:26:14,714 --> 00:26:15,354
Pei Jun.

401
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,234
Mengyao, enter from that side.

402
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:18,194
Okay.

403
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:27,314
I ordered your favorite latte.

404
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:27,834
Is that okay?

405
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,354
Yes, thank you.

406
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,914
You haven't changed at all
after all these years.

407
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:34,954
Thank you.

408
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:36,674
But you're completely different.

409
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:38,914
You used to follow Ran around.

410
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:40,434
After a trip to France,

411
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:41,514
you're a different person now.

412
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:42,674
Yes.

413
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,154
When I just arrived in France,
I felt awfully out of it.

414
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:47,954
I didn't expect
I would feel the same way at home.

415
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:50,194
Yes, I felt the same when I went abroad.

416
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:52,034
Life abroad seems easy.

417
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:53,314
But actually, I felt so stressed.

418
00:26:54,314 --> 00:26:55,514
When did you come back?

419
00:26:55,554 --> 00:26:56,674
I came back recently.

420
00:26:57,794 --> 00:26:59,674
When I just walked around,

421
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:02,554
I saw the restaurants
we used to go to together.

422
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,674
They're still there.

423
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,274
And I started thinking about those times

424
00:27:05,914 --> 00:27:08,074
when life was so simple and happy.

425
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:10,314
Time flies.

426
00:27:10,554 --> 00:27:11,920
Back then, An Ran and I...

427
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:18,954
Pei Jun.

428
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:23,034
So why did you break up with An Ran?

429
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:25,714
Didn't she tell you?

430
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:26,834
No.

431
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:29,554
She didn't tell me when I asked her.

432
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:33,274
You two were a perfect match.

433
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:34,434
So many people envied you.

434
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:35,714
You two were the model couple.

435
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:39,194
How could it end up in a breakup?

436
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:44,794
It was probably
because of some small things.

437
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:47,034
Maybe we both didn't understand love

438
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:48,314
at that time.

439
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:49,914
So it ended up that way.

440
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:53,514
But I've thought a lot abroad.

441
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:56,112
I was too hasty in my decision.

442
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:58,554
I made a mistake.

443
00:27:59,154 --> 00:28:01,776
Love is complicated.

444
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:06,274
So, what are your plans?

445
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,514
To be honest,

446
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:12,954
I came back for Ran.

447
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:15,714
I want to apologize to her in person

448
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,914
and win her back.

449
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:22,514
Mengyao, can you help me?

450
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:25,554
Sure.

451
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:31,274
Peng, do you think

452
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:33,794
this scene might be a bit dull?

453
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:39,434
I want to redo the lighting

454
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,034
and add some new elements in the scene.

455
00:28:42,794 --> 00:28:43,674
But,

456
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:45,554
I haven't figured out how to do it yet.

457
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:47,714
No worries. You can do it.

458
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:52,074
By the way, how do you feel
about working with Yaoyao?

459
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:55,194
She's super talented.

460
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:56,554
Her painting is stylish.

461
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:58,794
I've seen her new character design.

462
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,434
I want to modify our old design

463
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:02,794
to match hers.

464
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,074
Good.

465
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:07,274
I didn't expect Bai Mengyao
to get used to this job so quickly.

466
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:08,554
Let's go.

467
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:13,674
It's time to find Yan Yue.

468
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:23,674
I made an appointment with a client.
You go by yourself.

469
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:26,954
Which client?

470
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,434
I'll call the client.

471
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:32,816
We'll talk about it later.

472
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:36,434
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

473
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,554
What are you reading?

474
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,354
How about dinner tonight?

475
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,754
We can talk about something.

476
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,434
About what?

477
00:30:08,754 --> 00:30:09,954
An Ran said she wanted

478
00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:11,914
to establish a long-term cooperation
with you.

479
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:13,674
You think...

480
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,034
Let her talk to me.

481
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,154
Wait a minute.

482
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:21,434
She brought it up.

483
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:22,674
I didn't understand.

484
00:30:24,194 --> 00:30:25,904
How about I call her over?

485
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:28,554
We talk about it tonight?

486
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,794
Please.

487
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:53,936
Hello, Miss Lan.

488
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,354
Really?

489
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:58,914
Okay, we'll definitely prepare well.

490
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:00,514
That's great.

491
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,304
Friends,

492
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,152
I have good news to tell you.

493
00:31:12,474 --> 00:31:13,874
Miss Lan of Lansheng Investment

494
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:16,208
is very optimistic
about our Fragment Time Boyfriend.

495
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:20,394
She gave us the opportunity
to make a proposal to Lansheng.

496
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:24,834
But,

497
00:31:25,194 --> 00:31:26,634
the senior executives of Lansheng

498
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:28,554
are worried about our ability

499
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,074
to independently develop games.

500
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,914
Why?

501
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,794
Because we don't have any mature works.

502
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:36,034
So,

503
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,674
I proposed a plan to Miss Lan.

504
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,034
During the time
we're preparing our proposal,

505
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:43,954
we'll make a demo.

506
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:45,794
In this way,

507
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,674
our proposal will be more compelling.

508
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:53,554
Good idea.

509
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:55,834
So we don't have to show a presentation.

510
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:57,514
We make something

511
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:59,034
to prove our strength.

512
00:32:00,274 --> 00:32:02,154
Good for you.

513
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:04,434
Thank you.

514
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:08,074
But this demo,

515
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:09,554
four boyfriends,

516
00:32:09,714 --> 00:32:11,914
apart from drawing,
we need to dub it, right?

517
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:15,954
It's a problem.

518
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:18,434
Didn't you want to work with Heisha?

519
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:20,354
Yan Yue can help.

520
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:37,474
I don't think so.

521
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:40,634
We've troubled Mr. Heisha so many times.

522
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:41,914
No worries.

523
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,874
We can pay him.

524
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:44,994
To express our sincerity,

525
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:45,994
how about giving him shares?

526
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:50,234
I can help with the dubbing.

527
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:53,104
Who said I wouldn't do it?

528
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,394
Mr. Heisha is here.

529
00:32:57,914 --> 00:32:59,154
I don't need the shares.

530
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:01,394
But I have a condition.

531
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,994
Miss An is in charge of my dubbing work.

532
00:33:07,114 --> 00:33:10,634
After all, Miss An is my fan.

533
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:12,434
She knows my dubbing best.

534
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:18,514
Of course.

535
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:20,754
What about one more condition?

536
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:22,354
No dubbing in the morning.

537
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:24,754
That's not necessary.

538
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:33,394
We must be confident, right?

539
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:35,234
Alright, I will do a good job.

540
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:35,994
Miss An, bye.

541
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:36,914
Bye.

542
00:33:36,994 --> 00:33:37,754
See you, Miss An.

543
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:38,514
Bye.

544
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:39,914
See you.

545
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:41,034
- Bye.
- No problem.

546
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:46,954
Go home?

547
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:51,120
I'm going to the supermarket.

548
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:52,874
You go home first.

549
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:05,354
You go home.

550
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:33,840
It's raining so heavily.
I have no umbrella.

551
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:11,194
Ran.

552
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:13,194
Sorry, I'm late.

553
00:36:13,314 --> 00:36:13,834
That's okay.

554
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,434
It's raining heavily.

555
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:16,834
Are you hungry?

556
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:19,314
I booked a table at a restaurant.

557
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,114
Okay.

558
00:36:20,474 --> 00:36:20,994
Let's go.

559
00:36:55,641 --> 00:37:00,249
♪The movie told an undulating
and complicated story♪

560
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:07,961
♪And there is only one possibility
between us♪

561
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:14,521
