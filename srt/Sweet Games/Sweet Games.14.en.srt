00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:41,258

Hello, everyone.

- Hi, Mr. Hu.

79
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:45,498
Mr. Hu.

80
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:49,498
Hi, why did you come almost at noon?

00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:07,258

to discuss art issues with you.

89
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:43,818

Everyone needs to be there.

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,018
Shouldn't I also join you?

92
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:51,018
That's not your job.

93
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,938
We'll report to you
about our conclusion.

94
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:57,498
Come on. Let's have lunch.

95
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:30,378
I've known Mr. Liu from Mingyang Corp
for many years.

96
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:33,058
Lansheng wants
to deepen cooperation with them

97
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:35,018
through Fragment Time Boyfriend.

98
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:36,618
If successful,

99
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:38,738
they will invest a lot in it.

100
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:41,200
That's great.

101
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,738
So, we must strike
while the iron is hot.

102
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,018

00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:03,058

we will return tomorrow.

107
00:09:07,018 --> 00:09:08,018
You have something else to do?

108
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:09,738
I-I just remembered.

109
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:12,178
I have a meeting tomorrow night.

110
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:16,178

111
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:19,178

115
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,178
I got something big to tell you.

116
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:06,378
Bai Mengyao got mad at me.

117
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:07,738
What did you do?

118
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:13,178
Just do whatever she wants.

119
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:16,058
In a while, we will

120
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,178
- I gotta go.
- tell you our thoughts on this project.

121
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:18,738

122
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:21,938

123
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:23,858
from Mingyang Corp.

124
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,738
This is Miss An
from Gaishi Unparalleled.

125
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:26,498
Hello, Mr. Liu.

126
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:27,818
An Ran, nice to meet you.

127
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,818
Fragment Time Boyfriend

128
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:32,938
has always been our key project.

129
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:36,498
We are committed to creating a game
that reflects modern love relationships.

130
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:38,818
It's a healing game for urbanites,

131
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:40,738
aiming at women longing for love.

132
00:10:41,138 --> 00:10:43,058
We have conducted a beta version.

133
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:45,298
The results were very good.

134
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,224
(RECORDING)

135
00:11:08,178 --> 00:11:10,738
I thought being in love

136
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,618
was a remarkable thing.

137
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:15,778
I can walk across the hills.

138
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:18,298
But, until today,

139
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:19,658
I just realized it.

140
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:22,618
After eating the flesh of Monk Tang...

141
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:24,498
People can become immortal.

142
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:27,378
The difference
between love and being loved

143
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:29,098
is probably...

144
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,218
We say goodnight to each other.

145
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:32,538
You start sleeping,

146
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:33,858
and I start missing you.

147
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:35,978
To be, or not to be...

148
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:38,608
To be, or not to be...

149
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,058
That is the question.

150
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:42,538
Many years later,

151
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:45,298
if we are both not married,

152
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,098
it's really a pity.

153
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,778
It's really a pity.

154
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,938
It's too pitiful.

155
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:56,298
Our children will surely succeed.

156
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:06,418
Alright, everyone, let's call it a day.

157
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:08,418
Thank you all. Have a break.

158
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:09,618
Thank you for your hard work.

159
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:11,058
Please rest in the lounge.

160
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:12,538
- That's it for the meeting.
- Okay.

161
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:19,858
Miss Lan.

162
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:22,058
We barely ever meet.

163
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:23,538
Why don't we have a dinner?

164
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:24,858
It is my treat.

165
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,058
You can taste our Dongchuan cuisine.

166
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,618
My pleasure.

167
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:31,618
But here's one thing.

168
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,378
(Dongchuan, flight at 5:50 p.m.)
Since we're here,

169
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:36,498
when can we sign this letter of intent?

170
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:38,538
Miss Lan.

171
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,538
You still don't like to wait.

172
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:41,858
Don't worry.

173
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,738
I'll let my legal team draft it later.

174
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:45,978
We can go over it tomorrow morning.

175
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:47,098
That's great.

176
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:48,738
I hope we can work well together.

177
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:49,858
- Let's work well together.
- Let's work well together.

178
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:51,178

Mr. Heisha.

182
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:35,298
This is the script
for the next competition.

183
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,938
Let's go over it now.

184
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:47,618
Why are the voting results

185
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,178
already written in here?

186
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:51,738
This was decided

187
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:53,298
by the program team beforehand.

188
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:55,178
But I haven't even

189
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,618
seen the performances
of the contestants.

190
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:58,098
Why can they vote before that?

191
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:02,778
Mr. Heisha,
please don't make it difficult for us.

192
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:04,298
I don't.

193
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,098
I must be responsible
for the competition.

194
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:08,298
It is unfair to other contestants.

195
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:10,858
How about this?

196
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:12,658
You read the script first

197
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:14,298
and prepare for the program recording.

198
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:15,538
I'll go back and discuss it.

199
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:31,538
The car is here.

200
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,538
Here it is.

201
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,178
See you then.

202
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:36,778
See you, Mr. Liu.

203
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:38,738
See you tomorrow morning.

204
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:39,338
Alright.

205
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,098
We'll be there.

206
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:41,538
See you.

207
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:49,418
Are you drunk?

208
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:50,938
I'm fine.

209
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:55,178
Miss Lan, your car is here.

210
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:56,738
Okay, I have another appointment.

211
00:14:56,738 --> 00:14:57,618
I'll go first.

212
00:14:57,618 --> 00:14:58,738
You go back to the hotel.

213
00:14:58,738 --> 00:14:59,618
Be careful.

214
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:00,978
We have a meeting tomorrow.

215
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:02,058
Don't worry.

216
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:02,858
No problem.

217
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:03,538
Alright.

218
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:04,418
Bye.

219

Hello, Miss An.

00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:49,658
I want to confirm with you.

260
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:51,138
You booked a table at our restaurant

261
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:52,498

262
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:54,738

I have a meeting at 9 a.m.

272

273
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:40,418
is definitely better than
that of others.

274
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:42,658

281

282
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:00,298
We've been expecting you.

283
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:00,978
Welcome.

284
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:01,898

He's an art specialist.

286

Hello, everyone. My name is Chen Rui.

Alright.

291
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,258
That's your desk over there.

292
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:16,138
I'll take you to see it.

293
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:21,138
Good morning, have some milk tea.

294
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:22,178
Come on.

295
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:22,658
Mr. Hu.

296
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:23,418
Where's Bai Mengyao?

297
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:24,898
She hasn't come yet.

298
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:27,298
A new colleague, right?

299
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:28,178
Hello, I'm Hu...

300
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,778
Hello, Mr. Hu. I'm Chen Rui.

301
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:31,018
Hello.

302
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:32,778
Mengyao is here.

303
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:34,898
Good morning, beauty.

304
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:37,898
Let me
introduce a new colleague, Chen Rui.

305
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:38,898
Hello.

306
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:40,258
I'm a concept artist.

307
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:41,418
Just call me Mengyao.

308
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:42,298
Hello, Mengyao.

309
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:43,298
I'm Chen Rui,

310
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:45,378
mainly responsible for the marketing.

311
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,578
Beauty, have some milk tea.

312
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:51,138
Sorry. Mr. Hu doesn't care
about manners.

313
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:52,258
Don't mind him.

314
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:54,018
Have some milk tea.

315
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:55,778
Thank you.

316
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:56,658
Not at all.

317
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:00,898
Have some milk tea.

318
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:01,658
Come on.

319
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:02,418
Have some milk tea.

320
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:04,178
Smells good.

321
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,138
Mr. Hu.

322
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:07,898
Let's talk at the meeting room.

323
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:19,138
What is it?

324
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,378
Are you hungry?

325
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,258
How about I order some food?

326
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:26,018
Please confirm the character design.

327
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:38,258
It's okay.

328
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:41,498
I've given my revision suggestions.

329
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:45,498
Alright.

330
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,618
When does the promotional film team
need the final draft?

331
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:58,738
Mr. Hu, please be serious.

332
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:07,618
I forgot.

333
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:08,258
Well,

334
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:09,618
I'll confirm it later.

335
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:11,418
Alright.

336
00:22:11,658 --> 00:22:13,618
If there are no comments,
I'll go for revision.

337
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:14,538
Mengyao.

338
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:17,778
Can we be clear on something?

339
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,258
Of course.

340
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:24,898
I just made my point about my work.

341
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,178
Miss Lan has always had a good taste.

342
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:41,298
We haven't met for many years,

343
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:42,538
but now when we meet again,

344
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:44,178
you have brought us such a good project.

345
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:45,178
Thank you so much.

346
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,498
I also want to take this opportunity

347
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:49,378
to cooperate with you again.

348
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:50,858
To be honest,

349
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:52,138
the project Fragment Time Boyfriend

350
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,018
is Lansheng's top priority this year.

351
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:55,658
I'm personally optimistic about this.

352
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:57,658
As you can see,

353
00:22:57,658 --> 00:22:59,258
these young people

354
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:01,138
are creative and energetic.

355
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:03,018
They can create innovative stuff.

356
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,538
This is how we can precisely tap
into the young market.

357
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:06,178
Yes.

358
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:08,258
You have a good taste.

359
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:11,138
Why don't you

360
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:13,138
reconfirm this letter of intent?

361
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:14,298
My legal team has revised it.

362
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:15,898
If there are no problems,

363
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:17,498
we can sign it directly.

364
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:18,138
Okay.

365
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,778
I hope we work well together.

366
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:36,898
Miss Lan.

367
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:39,418
Is there anything else?

368
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:41,778
I want to leave first.

369
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:43,498
I have some important things to do.

370
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,538
Go ahead.

371
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:47,138
You do your things.

372
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:48,018
Thank you, Miss Lan.

373
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:48,898
See you.

374
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:50,778
Take care.

375
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:55,418
Okay, we're about to start recording.

376
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:56,378
Field staff,

377
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:57,858
please mute your phones.

378
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:02,538
Okay, please get ready.

379
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:03,418
We're about to start.

380
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:10,138
(An Ran, when will you return?)

381
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:27,538
(Passengers heading to Bowen,)

382
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:29,778
(we regret to inform)

383
00:24:30,498 --> 00:24:33,378
(your flight AY1314 has been delayed)

384
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:35,498
(due to weather conditions.)

385
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:37,978
(We sincerely apologize for this.)

386
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:48,458
Hello?

387
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:49,898
Hello, Miss An.

388
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:51,538
You haven't arrived
at the restaurant yet.

389
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:53,738
Do you still need us
to hold your reservation?

390
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:55,018
Yes, please.

391
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:56,898
We'll be there soon.

392
00:24:57,138 --> 00:24:58,538
Could you please wait a bit longer?

393
00:24:59,018 --> 00:24:59,498
Okay.

394
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:01,778
Your birthday cake has also arrived.

395
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:03,018
See you later.

396
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:04,738
Thank you.

397
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,018
Mr. Heisha, you haven't left yet?

398
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:35,378
I'm about to leave.

399
00:25:35,498 --> 00:25:36,858
- Thank you.
- You've worked hard.

400
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,696
(Yan Yue)

401
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,258
Hello, An Ran.

402
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:51,178
Yan Yue.

403
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:53,018
I'm sorry.

404
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:56,138
First of all, I remember your birthday.

405
00:25:56,658 --> 00:25:57,658
And I planned

406
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:59,658
to come back
this afternoon to surprise you.

407
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,138
I know it's pointless
to say anything now.

408
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:04,098
I was indeed delayed this afternoon.

409
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:06,258
I'm at the airport now.

410
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:09,658
But the flight has been delayed.

411
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:11,658
I'm sorry.

412
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:12,978
It's okay.

413
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:15,018
When will you arrive? I'll pick you up.

414
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:17,018
How about this?

415
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:18,418
I've booked a table.

416
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:20,138
Could you go to the restaurant first?

417
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:22,258
I should be boarding soon.

418
00:26:22,258 --> 00:26:24,978
I should arrive around 10 p.m.

419
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:27,018
Let's meet at the restaurant.

420
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:29,738
Okay, I'll wait for you.

421
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,498
Okay.

422
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:43,378
Mr. Heisha.

423
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:45,018
I'm glad you're here.

424
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:47,258
We need an additional recording
for a backup interview.

425
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,058
Didn't we finish recording?

426
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:49,818
Yes, we did.

427
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,538
But you didn't follow the script,

428
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,298
so it doesn't match

429
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:54,818
with our live voting results.

430
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:56,298
It's difficult
for the post-production team.

431
00:26:56,938 --> 00:26:58,698
Could you please record a few more?

432
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:00,138
Please do me a favor.

433
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,578
Xiaoting, come here.

434
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,418
Please redo Mr. Heisha's hair.

435
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:03,938
Hold on.

436
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,338
I remember I've told you many times.

437
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:09,498
I only say what I want to say.

438
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,778
The contestant you want me

439
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:13,018
to evaluate is less capable.

440
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:14,898
His vocal conditions
are far worse than his opponent's.

441
00:27:15,498 --> 00:27:17,178
Even if you let me repeat it
a million times,

442
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,418
my words will still be the same.

443
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:20,178
Mr. Heisha,

444
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:21,618
contestants have their strengths

445
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:22,898
and weaknesses.

446
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:24,378
Why don't you bring up his strengths

447
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,098
and talk more about them?

448
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,658
Then problem is solved.

449
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:28,498
I'm sorry.

450
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,618
I have important things to do.

451
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,658
Today's recording has already ended.

452
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:33,258
I have to go.

453
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:34,978
Mr. Heisha,

454
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:37,018
if you leave now,

455
00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:38,378
I can see this as a breach of contract.

456
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:41,978
According to our contract,

457
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:44,298
you invited me as a voice judge,

458
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:45,618
not an actor.

An Ran,

543
00:33:31,698 --> 00:33:32,938
while you were on a business trip,

544
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:35,858
I thought about
what you said to me that day.

545
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,458
I want to tell you

546
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:41,098
I'm determined

547
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:43,458
to be with you.

548
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,178
No matter when we get married

549
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:47,938
and have children,

550
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:49,898
I respect your decision.

551
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:53,418
I want to be with you for nothing else.

552
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:55,898
I just want

553
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:59,378
to have you for as long as I can.

554
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:10,458
Thank you for saying this to me.

555
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,818
Actually, for a couple, it's hard

556
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,498
to take a step forward,

557
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,418
yet it's so easy to take a step back.

558
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,138
In fact, before this,

559
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,858
I had no expectations

560
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:25,738
about love at all.

561
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,098
Now, I've met you,

562
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:33,898
and I've made up my mind

563
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,458
to fall in love again.

564
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:39,338
I understand

565
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:41,258
what your mother said before,

566
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:44,338
but what I want to say is

567
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:47,818
I...

568
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:51,938
I want to be with you

569
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:54,618
for the rest of my life.

570
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:07,858
Thank you, An Ran.

I hope to be with An Ran forever.

Yueyue, you want
to talk about An Ran, right?

598
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:15,138
Mother, I've thought it through.

599
00:37:16,624 --> 00:37:19,378
An Ran is the right girl for me.

600
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,480
Because of her,

601
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,400
I was able to come out of a closed world

602
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,040
and became a whole self.

603
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,400
I don't care where she's from,

604
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,440
how old she is,

605
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,560
whether she's successful,

606
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,880
or whether she's a good homemaker.

607
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,680
Those are not problems for me.

608
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,240
I like her.

609
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,880
Actually, no matter who I choose,

610
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,720
or what kind of life I live,

611
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,120
I think

612
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,960
I should make my own decisions.

613
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,720
This is what you've always taught me.

614
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,600
So,

615
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,160
I hope you can understand me.

616
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm afraid you'll regret it
in the future.

617
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
If I give up on An Ran,

618
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,120
I'll regret it the next second.

619
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,360
An Ran

620
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,440
has talked to me.

621
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,720
She told me

622
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,160
she has confidence in herself

623
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,720
and in you.

624
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,800
So...

625
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,080
So I won't stop you.

626
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,680
However,

627
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,240
An Ran didn't want me to tell you

628
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,360
she came to see me.

629
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,080
Okay, I get it.

630
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,240
I'll keep it a secret.

631
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,640
You silly boy.

632
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,800
An Ran.

633
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,120
Does it sound good?

634
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,600
Yes.

635
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,560
Look, does it look like me?

636
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,480
Exactly the same.

637
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,240
I think

638
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,160
if the bad sounds can't be eliminated,

639
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,080
we can create some beautiful sounds.

640
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,640
(From being in love to living together,)

641
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,440
(don't worry too much
about things before they happen.)

642
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,440
(It took Jesse and Celine a decade)

643
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,960
(to get there.)

644
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,160
(You have to fight time.)

645
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,640
Look, your skin is so good.

646
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,120
No need for retouching.

647
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,160
Auntie, your smile is beautiful.

648
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,720
Really?

649
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,840
You look so young.

650
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,880
If only I had a daughter.

651
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,200
When I go out with Yan Yue,

652
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,400
he's so quiet and boring.

653
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,360
That's him.

654
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,640
Please understand him.

655
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,880
If you don't mind,

656
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
I'll go shopping
and visit different places

657
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,600
with you.

658
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
That would be great!

659
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,440
If you have nothing else to do,

660
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,800
let's do a facial together.

661
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,600
Okay.

662
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,960
Could you send me these pictures?

663
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,400
Okay, I'll send them to you right away.

664
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,040
Looks good.

665
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,920
I'll send it all to you.

666
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,640
Okay, Yan Yue looks so much like you
when he smiles.
