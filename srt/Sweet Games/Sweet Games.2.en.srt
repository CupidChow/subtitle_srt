- Okay.

When I rented the house to you,

79
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:03,706
I didn't come to see it.

80
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,706
It's different from the picture.

81
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:07,506
We tidied up the office.

82
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:08,586
Now it looks good.

83
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:11,146

Good morning, Mrs. Hu.

87
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,866
Good morning, Mr. Hu.

00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:24,226

Gaishi Unparalleled?

93
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,186
I named it.

94
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:58,106
The name

95
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:00,386
means we aim to make

96
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:03,426
Fragment Time Boyfriend
the best romance game on the market.

97
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,466
It also means

98
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,106
our irreplaceable friendship.

99
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:10,768
Mrs. Hu, look at
how dedicated Mr. Hu is.

100
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:12,866
No offense.

101
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:16,176
But you work so hard every day
without making money.

102
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:17,866
Why do you have to?

103
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,746
Mom.

104
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:19,706
Ignoring the rest,

105
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:22,106
with your current financial situation,

106
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:24,586
can you afford such an office?

107
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,106
If you

108
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:30,266
hadn't offered us
such a high-end office,

109
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,586
we wouldn't be talking
about dreams here.

110
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:33,906
An Ran,

111
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,666
your parents and I are old neighbors,

112
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,066
but I want to tell you,

113
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,226
you can't rely on dreams for a living.

114
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:42,786
Mrs. Hu,

115
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,746
after several years of polishing,

116
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:47,386
our project has reached
the production stage.

117
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:49,506
Now we just lack a key amount of funds

118
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:50,946
to keep on.

119
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,226
We've done research.

120
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,626
This game will be definitely popular.

121
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:56,506
It's very difficult

122
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:58,506
to develop a new game

123
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,946
with just a few of you.

124
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,786
You've been seeking investors.

125
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,266
Have you seen a penny?

126
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,106
Mom, what's not difficult now?

127
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:10,226
If you don't believe in me,

128
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,226
you should believe in her ability.

129
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,186
Well then,

130
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,066
starting next month,

131
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:17,466
you'll give me the rent

132
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:19,066
for this office.

133
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:21,946
I'd like to see your abilities.

134
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:30,426
Are you really my mother?

135
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:33,040
Asking for rent
isn't like adding insult to injury?

136
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,146
You just lack our money?

137
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:38,466
Isabella has already delayed
our rent for a long time.

138
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:40,066
Already very considerate.

139
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,146
Hello, Mr. Wang.

140
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,386
Yes, I'm interested.

141
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,746
So the details are...

142
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:55,266
I see.

143
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:56,746
No.

144
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:57,506
Sure.

145
00:06:58,346 --> 00:06:59,226
Thank you.

146
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,226
Then, we'll wait for your news.

147
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:02,826
Alright.

148
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,346
Here's a job.

149
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:06,666
What job?

150
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,386
Mr. Wang from Tiansheng.

151
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:09,786
We met at the alumni meeting.

152
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,346
They have a job

153
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:12,546
and want to outsource to us.

154
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:13,466
Are you crazy?

155
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:15,506
Ignoring our own game

156
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,066
and working for others?

157
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:20,466
How do you think we can get money?

158
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,066
We need money for the game

159
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,626
we're working on, salaries and rent.

160
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,066
I've heard

161
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,186
Mr. Wang is picky

162
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,586
and often late in payment.

163
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:29,866
He is stingy and unreliable.

164
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:30,866
Can it work?

165
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,346
We have to do it

166
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,146
even if it's not very efficient.

167
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,266
First earn the money,

168
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:38,146
and then fulfill the dreams.

169
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:20,106
(It's been many years.)

170
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:21,706
(Is she still the same?)

171
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:23,786
(Is she simple?)

172
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:25,626
(Is she peaceful?)

173
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:28,546
(Or is she gentle?)

174
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:31,946
(After this reunion,)

175
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,346
(will nothing really happen?)

176
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,746
Hey, what are you doing?

177
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:42,466
Yo, hey.

178
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:43,946
Off work yet?

179
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:45,626
Have you eaten?

180
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,186
(Assassin, catch the assassin.)

181
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:02,466
(The firelight gradually gathers
at the base of the tower.)

182
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:05,066
(A man leaps into the room.)

183
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:07,946
(A noticeable stumble)

184
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:12,266
(throws him onto her slender body.)

185
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:15,866
(The two of them fall back
into the corner together.)

186
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,306
Have you eaten?

187
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:19,666
Have you eaten?

188
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:26,786
(Jiang Shan's voice
is still so magnetic.)

189
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,786
(Why do I feel it is a bit hoarse?)

190
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,266
(Did he not rest well?)

191
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,026
(Is it Jiang Shan's voice?)

192
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:33,386
(It's not hoarse.)

193
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,626
(That's popular vocal fry.)

194
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:38,426
Isn't this the exclusive vocal fry
of Jiang Shan?

195
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:43,946
Too noisy.

196
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:48,146
The first rule here

197
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:49,626
is to keep quiet.

198
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:53,026
I'm sorry. Then I'll turn it down a bit.

199
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:54,426
The sound over 50 decibels

200
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:55,866
is noise.

201
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,026
How can this be considered noise?

202
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,946
At most, it's vocal fry.

203
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:08,866
Miss An,

204
00:10:09,186 --> 00:10:10,426
after our discussion,

205
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,426
we think we should give you a chance.

206
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:15,226
The holiday event planning
for World of Imagination

207
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,226
is almost done.

208
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:18,386
We're counting on you for it.

209
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:19,146
Thank you.

210
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,786
Mr. Wang, rest assured.

211
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,386
We won't let you down.

212
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:28,146
Hu Yingjun, meet
at the usual spot in 30 min.

213
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:33,986
How's the move going?

214
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,226
Just so-so.

215
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,786
The landlord is tough,

216
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:38,026
but the house is good.

217
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:39,906
That's good.

218
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,426
Landlords aren't easy either.

219
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:45,866
Do you know how hard it is for us?

220
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:48,546
We're taking on work, aren't we?

221
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:51,266
As soon as Mr. Wang pays,

222
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:53,426
with the ability of our company,

223
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:54,666
we can make it.

224
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,546
Easy for you to say.

225
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,466
But we will do production and dubbing

226
00:10:58,466 --> 00:10:59,706
simultaneously.

227
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,906
We haven't found a voice actor yet.

228
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:04,106
It's just dubbing. Is it that hard?

229
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,346
Let me tell you,

230
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:08,426
our game

231
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:11,666
is actually the same
as radio dramas and audiobooks.

232
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,586
The plot and characters

233
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,346
are conveyed through sound.

234
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,666
Sound is the soul.

235
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:19,986
And the actor must be professional

236
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,906
and also have a certain influence.

237
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:25,226
Why don't you just invite Jiang Shan?

238
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,266
I wish.

239
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,906
But he's a celebrity.

240
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,226
How can we afford it?

241
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,386
Boss, big surprise.

242
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,466
I got the vice-captain of my game team.

243
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:39,786
The dubbing is solved.

244
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,426
He can do it for us.

245
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:42,466
A netizen?

246
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:44,906
Hu Yingjun,

247
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,466
we need to attach importance
to a contractor's work.

248
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:50,586
You can't just casually
find someone to do it.

249
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,026
Don't look down on him.

250
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,226
He's a voice actor,

251
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:55,786
and it took me begging him.

252
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,146
Voice actor?

253
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:58,946
I know about all the voice actors.

254
00:11:59,026 --> 00:11:59,506
Who's it?

255
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,266
Heisha, from Jiang Shan's studio.

256
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:06,226
Didn't he dub an animation last year

257
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,306
called...

258
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:08,786
You Above All Else.

259
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:09,666
Yes.

260
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,906
Where are you? He's almost here.

261
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,626
I'm at the door now.

262
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,386
Hu Yingjun is quite capable.

263
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,666
He's done a good job
integrating resources.

264
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:24,666
Heisha.

265
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,666
Although he's not Jiang Shan,

266
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,586
he is a master too.

267
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:30,986
Not bad.

268
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,106
Tian Xin, the proposal given
by Mr. Wang.

269
00:12:44,186 --> 00:12:45,066
Already done.

270
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,346
Peng.

271
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:49,266
Forget it.

272
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:50,506
Changfeng,

273
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,826
how is the program
given by Tiansheng Corp?

274
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,186
It's a piece of cake.

275
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:55,506
It just needs modification.

276
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:57,066
Wu,

277
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:58,506
the deposit.

278
00:12:59,026 --> 00:12:59,666
It's in.

279
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:00,306
Yeah!

280
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,186
Hu Yingjun, where's the master?

281
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:04,986
Didn't you see him?

282
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:07,106
Shouldn't you go to greet him?

283
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:09,546
He's my close friend. No need for it.

284
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:12,186
Here he is.

285
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:13,666
Let me introduce him.

286
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,426
This is my close friend

287
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,706
and top voice actor, Mr. Heisha.

288
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:19,866
This is our vice president

289
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:21,426
and also my partner, An Ran.

290
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,226
How can you be Heisha?

291
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:29,426
Why can't I be?

292
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,546
Can I delay

293
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:39,986
paying the rent for a few days?

294
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:43,066
How long?

295
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:44,626
Too noisy.

296
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:46,106
The first rule here

297
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,506
is to keep quiet.

298
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:52,186
You wait.

299
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:54,386
You sure you want him?

300
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:56,066
Do you have any other options?

301
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:58,746
Right?

302
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,106
Don't worry. He's my sworn buddy

303
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:01,986
in the game.

304
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,186
Let me tell you.

305
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,306
He's my landlord living next door to me.

306
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:08,746
Is that true?

307
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,826
That's even better.

308
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,626
Fate is inexplicable.

309
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,426
Inexplicable?

310
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,066
Do you know he is tricky?

311
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:21,066
He's not energetic and friendly at all.

312
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:23,546
I'm rambling.

313
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,986
From a professional perspective,

314
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,506
you can't choose close friends.

315
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,386
Come on.

316
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,746
If it's not someone you know,

317
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:31,986
you can handle it?

318
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,746
What stage is the company at?

319
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:37,426
It can't continue.

320
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,746
Check the contract
and I'll give it to him.

321
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:48,066
Hu Yingjun.

322
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:51,146
(Working Time)
We unconditionally cooperate with him?

323
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:52,026
His time matters,

324
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:53,066
but ours doesn't?

325
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:53,746
Stop.

326
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:55,306
Keep it down.

327
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,626
Can you invite Jiang Shan?

328
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:01,426
And didn't you see this clause?

329
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:02,946
Party B shall do dubbing for free

330
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:05,986
(Payment)
during the cooperation.

331
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:07,146
For free.

332
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:11,106
Isn't he your sworn buddy?

333
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,426
What's wrong?

334
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,426
Nothing. We're discussing the contract.

335
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,226
Let's enter.

336
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:25,986
Is there any other problem?

337
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,386
Miss An?

338
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,106
No, there isn't.

339
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:33,680
Mr. Heisha, glad to work with you.

340
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,666
You don't seem glad.

341
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:39,746
How could that be?

342
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:43,066
I'm a loyal fan of yours.

343
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,226
It must be a pleasure to work with you.

344
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:46,626
Then you must have heard

345
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:47,946
my show, right?

346
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:50,426
Yes, I listen every day.

347
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:52,066
What was your favorite part

348
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:53,546
of my show last night?

349
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,546
Yesterday, I was a bit busy.

350
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,066
I didn't get a chance to...

351
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:00,746
And the day before it?

352
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:04,506
I didn't...

353
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,986
I'm really your fan.

354
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,986
I know the origin of your name.

355
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,266
You know it?

356
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:18,746
It's from the comic
Disaster Star Lovers.

357
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,808
(Disaster Star Lovers)

358
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,866
The knight in it is called Heisha.

359
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:36,866
Look, Mr. Heisha is so busy.

360
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,626
We'd better start working now.

361
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:40,546
I'll call them for a meeting.

362
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:45,746
I'll go too.

363
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:55,746
Hu Yingjun,

364
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:59,226
this is
the top-quality project you said?

365
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:01,826
There's not much difference

366
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,426
between projects, is there?

367
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,866
Here, and here,

368
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:10,066
and here.

369
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:12,826
Unclear character design and theme.

370
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:16,466
And here, getting players to top up
isn't about robbing them.

371
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:18,226
Bottom line?

372
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:21,106
I can't do it.

373
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:22,466
Mr. Heisha,

374
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:24,746
our project's flawed,

375
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,266
but it has much room for improvement.

376
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:27,906
Right.

377
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:30,306
I can revise the plan again,

378
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:32,986
and many details
have not yet been perfected.

379
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:34,666
Mr. Heisha,

380
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,506
we attach great importance to it.

381
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:39,146
Otherwise, we wouldn't invite
an expert like you.

382
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:41,266
Right.

383
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,266
This...

384
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:44,368
You said...

385
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:45,026
The character design.

386
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:46,746
Right, the character design...

387
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,106
Anyway, Miss An
will oversee it the whole way.

388
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:52,906
Right, we promise

389
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,386
to polish it into a work

390
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:55,866
worthy of your efforts.

391
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:56,866
Right.

392
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:02,666
Since you are my fan,

393
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:04,346
I'll reconsider it.

394
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,466
But Miss An,

395
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:10,026
please make sure you're truly my fan.

396
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:13,746
Absolutely genuine.

397
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:25,146
(Is it really bad? Is it?)

398
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:27,280

(Dialogue Plan 1)

400
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,586
(He was right.)

401
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:37,066
(It's a bit hasty.)

402
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:39,536
(Duan Aotian Dialogue Plan 1)

403
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:43,746
Miss An,

404
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:46,626
there may be thunderstorms today.

405
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:49,346
Shall we get off work early today?

406
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:51,746
Let's get off work today.

407
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:52,186
Okay.

408
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:54,288
(So quickly.)

409
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:55,946
We are leaving.

410
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:56,866
Bye.

411
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:58,106
Bye.

412
00:18:58,426 --> 00:18:59,466
See you tomorrow.

(Double Fare)

414
00:19:08,706 --> 00:19:11,186
The cab fare doubles when it rains.

415
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,986
Hey, Hu Yingjun, have you left?

416
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:16,946
I'm getting a car with Yan Yue.

417
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,906
Can you give me a lift?

418
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:22,906
Okay, wait for me.

419
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,906
Why is it you? Where's Hu Yingjun?

420
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,386
He left.

421
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:50,266
Get in.

422
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:52,266
Thanks, Mr. Heisha.

423
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:05,146
Your car is so new.

424
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:08,866
Has anyone ever sat in this seat?

425
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:11,146
I know.

426
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:13,546
As you are so handsome,

427
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,146
this seat must be packed.

428
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:23,906
Why do you always wear headphones?

429
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:35,306
Well,

430
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:37,066
when can our work

431
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,146
officially start?

432
00:20:39,386 --> 00:20:40,146
Well,

433
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:42,066
we live so close now,

434
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,426
and we'll work together.

435
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:45,386
What a coincidence.

436
00:20:45,386 --> 00:20:46,746
Do you remember

437
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:48,026
what happened that night?

438
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:55,506
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

439
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,586
It was wrong to throw up at your home.

440
00:20:57,986 --> 00:20:58,786
That's all?

441
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:00,106
What?

442
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,986
(What exactly happened that night?)

443
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:07,586
Well,

444
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,466
can we talk about it later?

445
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:14,586
By the way,

446
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:16,906
for the modifications
you proposed today,

447
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:18,986
we'll make them and send them

448
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,226
to you tonight.

449
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,346
I remember what I said

450
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:23,826
is I will reconsider it.

451
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,106
Focus on driving,

452
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:28,986
and we'll talk later.

453
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,346
A bit quiet. Let's listen to a song.

454
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,986
(It's unbearably cold late at night.)

455
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:02,746
(Cheng Yuling took off her makeup,)

456
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:05,106
(with only a thin coat.)

(Duan Aotian Dialogue 2)
(Wang Xu told her to wait.)

458
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:10,506
(He went to get his Ford
parked far away)

459
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:11,786
(to pick her up.)

460
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:12,506
Hello.

461
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,586
Yan Yue doesn't dub in the morning,

462
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,506
and Jiang Shan's studio

463
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:18,266
has been booked

464
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:19,306
for the next three afternoons,

465
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,346
except the mornings.

466
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,586
Other studios are twice as expensive.

467
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,066
Book the morning.

468
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:25,226
Okay.

469
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:26,186
And,

470
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,426
go listen to Yan Yue's program.

471
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:30,946
Don't just say it.

472
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:32,706
Don't blow your cover.

473
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:35,586

(Heisha talks about many classic works.)

482
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:05,986
(He's definitely a literary youth.)

for three years.)

484

to be so professional.)

Can we dub tomorrow morning?

499
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:47,946
I didn't agree.

Not really.

What kind of music
do you usually listen to?

531
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:25,986
Actually, I like to listen
to some programs too.

I listen to your show on time every day.

534

And I also watch
the movies you talk about.

535
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,146
I've printed out the lines

536
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:39,786

in the morning.

564
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:40,106
Even I haven't managed to do this.

565
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:42,066
I'll go record first.

566
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:44,546
Jiang Shan is inside.

567
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,306
Jiang Shan is recording?

568
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,546
Yes, he's been recording all night.

569
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:50,706
Why are you so excited?

570
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:52,706
Aren't you my fan?

571
00:30:53,306 --> 00:30:54,946
Yes, of course.

572
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,186
You like him too?

573
00:30:59,346 --> 00:31:00,546
Of course,

574
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,826
I like you.

575
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:05,346
Do you want to take a picture with him?

576
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:06,306
Really?

577
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,186
No.

578
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:10,026
I have a friend.

579
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:11,586
She's been his fan.

580
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,826
I'll Photoshop her head onto mine.

581
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:29,946
You're here so early today.

582
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:32,346
Who is this?

583
00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:34,986
This is An Ran, my fan.

584
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:38,706
Nan.

585
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:41,426
He has quite a lot of female fans.

586
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:45,186
Don't you have a date today?

587
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:46,786
When did I have a date?

588
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:48,946
When don't you have a date?

589
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:51,586
I forgot.

590
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:54,066
I should have a date today.

591
00:31:54,306 --> 00:31:54,946
Go ahead.

592
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:56,866
Alright, you guys chat. Bye.

593
00:31:57,866 --> 00:31:58,426
Bye.

594
00:31:58,826 --> 00:31:59,386
Bye.

595
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:06,066
Are we gonna dub or not?

596
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:07,186
Yeah.

597
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:08,306
Yeah.

598
00:32:08,746 --> 00:32:09,066
Yeah.

599
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,666
Why is your face so red?

600
00:32:12,986 --> 00:32:13,586
I'm hot.

601
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:15,186
Hot?

602
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:16,346
Aren't you?

603
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:25,626
You sure you can finish it this morning?

604
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:27,026
Do you want more time?

605
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,706
Just this morning. We can finish it.

606
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:38,986
I don't know

607
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:41,066
why you appeared in this world,

608
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,386
but since you have unsealed me,

609
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:45,466
I'll pay you back equally.

610
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:47,066
Mr. Heisha,

611
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,426
can you cheer up a little more?

612
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:50,706
Okay, I'll try.

613
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:52,586
I don't know

614
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:54,306
why you appeared in this world,

615
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:56,346
but since you have unsealed me,

616
00:32:56,546 --> 00:32:57,426
I'll pay you...

617
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:00,866
Sorry. Again.

618
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,426
Mr. Heisha,

619
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:05,706
your voice today sounds like...

620
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:08,226
It's hoarse when I don't sleep well.

621
00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:14,706
Well,

622
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:18,066
I feel like he's eaten too much today.

623
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,906
Not smooth.

624
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:24,106
I don't know

625
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:25,986
why you appeared in this world,

626
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:27,346
but...

627
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:28,346
Mr. Heisha,

628
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,106
do you want a throat lozenge

629
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:33,426
to ease the discomfort?

630
00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:36,106
Sorry,

631
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:39,146
you shouldn't eat sweets
during the recording.

632
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:39,906
It's sticky.

633
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:41,866
Sorry, I didn't know.

634
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:44,906
My throat is sore.

635
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:48,386
Don't.

636
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:51,386
Come on.

637
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:02,626
Again.

638
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:07,146
As long as the wish
I owe you is not fulfilled,

639
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:09,466
I will always stay by your side,

640
00:34:10,226 --> 00:34:12,586
answer your call
and appear at any time.

641
00:34:12,752 --> 00:34:13,466
However,

642
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,146
you better think again
about what you wish for.

643
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:19,666
Don't worry.
Heisha finds his state quickly.

644
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:22,546
It's so easy to work with him.

645
00:34:23,106 --> 00:34:24,546
All the dangerous things

646
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:25,626
can't harm you.

647
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:28,226
So, in this world,

648
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:30,906
only the strong can survive to the end.

649
00:34:31,386 --> 00:34:32,626
But don't worry,

650
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:34,426
if you encounter danger,

651
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:35,946
I will accompany you

652
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:37,786
and fight with you.

653
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:40,586
Okay, next one.

654
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:44,186
So many.

655
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:47,866
Why can't you do it when I'm with you?

656
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:09,066
(The girl took two steps back.)

657
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:12,666
(She unfurled her costume
and draped it over herself.)

658
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:15,746
(In an instant,
she put on a flirty look.)

659
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:18,992
(Even without headgear and makeup,)

660
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:22,186
(she instantly became gorgeous.)

(Wang Xu wanted to get closer,)

664
00:35:33,946 --> 00:35:36,186
(but for a moment
he was lost in thought.)

665
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:41,904
(Updates
from the followed Weibo accounts)

666
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:46,626
Hello.

667
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:48,586
Good, Miser An.

668
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:50,586
I heard you let Yan Yue finish

669
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:51,786
two days' work this morning.

670
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:53,746
How about my abilities as a CEO?

671
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,106
Did you hear the applause?

672
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,466
Did you listen to his show?

673
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:01,866
Not yet.
Why are you like an alarm clock?

674
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:04,306
Do it. What if he asks you again

675
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:05,346
like that day?

676
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:06,106
You fake fan.

677
00:36:06,386 --> 00:36:07,312
Alright.

(Heisha Time)

679
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,146
(Today one listener asked me)

680
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:17,946
(if tomorrow would be better.)

681
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:19,826
(I don't know.)

682

(A teacher once said)

683
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:23,426
(the surest in life)

684
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,346
(is uncertainty.)

685
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:28,666
(We can only do what's right now,)

686
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,306
(have a good sleep,)

687
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:32,546
(and have expectations for tomorrow.)

688
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:34,626
Stop being so arty.

689
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:38,426
What the listeners need is relaxation.

(Do you prefer the knight Heisha or the prince?)

695
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:51,024
(I prefer the knight as the princess is
not the prince's one and only.)

696
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:54,826
Hello, Yan Yue.

697
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:55,786
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

698
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:57,426
An urgent matter.

699
00:37:57,946 --> 00:37:59,866
What name will you use for the dubbing?

700
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:04,946
I've decided.

701
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:06,666
I'll use

702
