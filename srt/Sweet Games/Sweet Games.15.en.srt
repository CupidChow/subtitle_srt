Hello, An Ran.

34
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,458
Yan Yue, I'm going home
for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

35
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,778
Can you help me with my parcels?

36
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:35,578
Right now?

37
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,218
Yes, it's right at the doorstep.

38
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:38,458
Thank you, muah.

39
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:38,898
Alright.

40
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:57,218
Dad, Mom.

41
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:58,138
Ran.

42
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,178
My sweetie!

43
00:02:59,178 --> 00:02:59,898
I'm home.

44
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:00,738
Ran.

45
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:02,018
You haven't been eating properly.

46
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:02,698
You've lost weight.

47
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:03,778
I haven't been eating properly?

48
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,418
So I came home to let you fatten me up.

49
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,618
I'll take it.

50
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:07,578
Dad, you have backache.

51
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,338
My girl is so thoughtful.

52
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,018
- Go.
- You're home.

53
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:12,658
Go inside.

54
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:13,858
What have you made for me?

55
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:15,578
All your favorites.

56
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:15,898
Really?

57
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:17,618
Let's go.

58
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,418
Take it slow.

59
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:18,898
It's fine.

60
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,458
Let's go.

61
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:20,738
Go.

62
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:21,658
Alright.

(The Temptation of Going Home)

64
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,738
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?

65
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,458
You're on vacation.

66
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:57,458
Didn't Bai Mengyao invite you out?

67
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,338
Don't mention it.

68
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,778
I don't know what got into her recently.

69
00:04:01,778 --> 00:04:03,178
She's been giving me the cold shoulder.

70
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,018
Think about it.

71
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:08,898
At the company,

72
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:09,938
she laughs and talks

73
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:11,018
with other colleagues.

74
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:11,738
But once she sees me,

75
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:13,138
the corners of her mouth drop.

76
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,458
And we used to have a chat

77
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:17,138
after talking about work.

78
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:19,938
But now, unless necessary,
she doesn't say one more word.

79
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:21,578
She doesn't even spare me a glance.

80
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:22,738
Tell me,

81
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:24,938
how can a person change so drastically?

82
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:27,858
Why do you care so much?

83
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:31,418
Why?

84
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:35,378
You care?

85
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:38,498
What?

86
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:42,218
You like her?

87
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:48,338
I don't know.

88
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:51,778
So when she ignores you,

89
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:54,018
it hurts.

90
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:03,018
Don't you know the trick
of playing hard to get?

91
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:05,298
Playing hard to get?

92
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,738
How can you be so clueless?

93
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:10,618
A girl who was very close to you

94
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:12,938
suddenly becomes aloof one day,

95
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,218
keeping you at an arm's length.

96
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,898
Aren't you perplexed,

97
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,018
wondering what you did wrong?

98
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:19,618
See.

99
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:21,178
This is how you've let her

100
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:23,178
steal your heart.

101
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:25,618
Hi.

102
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:30,418
You're fully energized today.

103
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:32,178
Thanks.

104
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:39,778
So, you mean

105
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:41,458
she's playing games with me?

106
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:44,738
Not exactly.

107
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,498
It's a methodology.

108
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:47,858
The key point is

109
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,418
that you said she's normal
with everyone else,

110
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,338
except you.

111
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,458
What does it mean?

112
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,418
It means that you are special to her.

113
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:57,138
You're not like the others.

114
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:00,058
Quite serious.

115
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,498
Let's all have lunch together

116
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,338
and discuss the project
while we're at it.

117
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:07,498
What are we gonna eat?

118
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:08,138
I'll treat.

119
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:17,738
Really? You don't know about it.

120
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:19,898
You do?

121
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:29,098
Annoying.

122
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:32,618
I think

123
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:35,298
right now you need to figure out

124
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,418
what you actually think.

125
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,098
It does feel like

126
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,098
it's not quite the same

127
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:52,898
as before.

128
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:16,658
- It's you!
- It's you!

129
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:18,658
This is the culprit
of my financing failure.

130
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,098
Now courting a rich woman
is called financing, huh?

131
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:22,098
Be careful, An Ran.

132
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,098
Your partner is a conman.

133
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:24,418
He lives off women.

134
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:25,458
(I live off women?)

135
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,098
(Besides, do I live off your family?)

136
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:27,978
(Anyway, you're a leech.)

137
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:35,298
I

138
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,098
never dated

139
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,178
before going to France.

140
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,298
Do you believe it?

141
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:41,658
Really?

142
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:45,098
I had a crush
on a senior for four years.

143
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,298
I didn't dare to say I liked him
until we graduated.

144
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,858
I was afraid that if he knew it,

145
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:51,338
he would come to refuse me.

146
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,338
Don't get a stiff neck,

147
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:04,018
okay?

148
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:18,778
Je t'aime.

149
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:22,538
The

150
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,218
ta

151
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:27,538
me?

152
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:29,178
Smart.

153
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,538
(Why don't you ask what this means?)

154
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:33,298
(What does it mean?)

155
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:36,978
I love you.

156
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:55,538
Two.

157
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:02,898
Put some strength into it.

158
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:03,738
Again.

159
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:06,658
Again.

160
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:08,658
Again.

161
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:11,218
Think of me as

162
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,218
the person you hate the most.

163
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:12,738
Come on.

164
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,258
The person you hate the most.

165
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,098
How long do you plan
to crash at my place?

166
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:16,978
I'm leaving right away.

167
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,738
When is "right away"?

168
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:26,418
I'm leaving now.

169
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:27,978
I'm going out for some exercise.

170
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:30,098
You're going to see
Bai Mengyao, aren't you?

171
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:33,218
You know everything, don't you?

172
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,618
I want to learn boxing too, coach.

173
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:08,658
What a coincidence.

174
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:09,338
You're here

175
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:11,218
to learn boxing too.

176
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:12,738
Why are you here?

177
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:20,858
I'm here to box.

178
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:22,018
What's wrong?

179
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,418
I am only allowed

180
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:25,098
to dominate in video games,

181
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,098
not the real world?

182
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:30,098
How about it?

183
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:31,538
Do I feel a bit like a boxing master?

184
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:36,298
Are you tired?

185
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:38,618
Do you want some water?

186
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,418
You're already tapped out, Mr. Hu?

187
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:42,658
What are you saying?

188
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:43,738
I am not.

189
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,098
Then,

190
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,898
why don't we fight on the stage?

191
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:50,858
Scared?

192
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,858
No worries.
Then I'll go fight with the coach.

193
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:54,738
Coach.

194
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:55,658
No.

195
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:57,538
Hit me.

196
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:02,658
Come on, don't go easy on me.

197
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:07,778
- Don't.
- Hit me.

198
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:09,218
Not so invincible now?

199
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:11,338
- You haven't eaten?
- Please don't.

200
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:13,418
No face punches, please.

201
00:12:13,418 --> 00:12:14,778
No face punches.

202
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:15,658
No face punches.

203
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:20,618
Are you chickening out?

204
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,098
Just you wait.

205
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:52,418
Take a break.

206
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:54,538
Thanks.

207
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:05,898
An Ran went home.

208
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,218
Are you bored being alone?

209
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:08,898
I guess it's alright.

210
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:10,418
Alright?

211
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:12,738
Then let me and my little fists

212
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:15,098
keep Mr. Lonely company.

213
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,658
You've gone mad, haven't you?

214
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:19,978
You don't understand.

215
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:22,418
I'm fighting

216
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,538
for my love life.

217
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:24,898
I don't care what it is for.

218
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:26,298
Just don't ruin my furniture.

219
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:28,978
As if only your stuff is valuable.

220
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:32,978
You even got a glorious injury.

221
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:36,778
A real man

222
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,738
should shed blood and sweat

223
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,458
for the girl he loves.

224
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:42,778
Just you wait.

225
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,418
Once I've mastered boxing,

226
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,658
I'll dominate the ring
and win the beauty.

227
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:47,898
Gross.

228
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:23,024
(Express mail sent by An Jianguo
to An Ran with home address)

229
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,085
(Distance: 203 kilometers
Takes 2 hours and 38 minutes)

230
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:10,098
You're here.

231
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:15,738
Are you serious?

232
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:17,418
Bai Mengyao,

233
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,018
I'm your training partner today.

234
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,258
If I whine, I'll change my name.

235
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:22,778
Alright.

236
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:25,418
Just don't get beaten up
and run away again.

237
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:26,858
Just you wait.

238
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,738
You've been practicing
a lot recently, huh?

239
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,378
Are you okay?

240
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,258
You just bumped into her. Apologize!

241
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:58,498
What's it to you?

242
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,018
This is a boxing gym.

243
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:02,338
Isn't it normal to bump into each other?

244
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:04,898
And it's a pretty girl.

245
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,018
I didn't notice just now.

246
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:08,098
How about I practice with you

247
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,898
as an apology?

248
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:10,378
You...

249
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:11,898
Mind your language.

250
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:12,498
Are you crazy?

251
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:14,098
Hey you, keep it down.

252
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:16,258
Can't take it?

253
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:18,018
Up for a round?

254
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:20,898
Hu Yingjun,

255
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:22,018
forget it.

256
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:24,418
Hello, Shan.

257
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:25,738
Where are you?

258
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,418
I'm now at the gate
of An Ran's old house.

259
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,378
I was wondering why I couldn't find you.

260
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,618
Alright, I'll just tell you.

261
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:36,258
Our studio has a new audiobook project

262
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:37,418
called Lovely Moonlight.

263
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:39,498
This is our biggest project

264
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:40,738
this year.

265
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,378
You have to come back to dub it.

266
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:44,258
Got it. Bye.

267
00:17:56,313 --> 00:18:01,616
(Yan Yue)

268
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,098
Son,

269
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:27,218
why are you

270
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:28,738
standing here in this hot weather?

271
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:29,898
Go upstairs.

272
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:31,498
I don't live here.

273
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:32,978
You don't live here?

274
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:36,498
You can't stand here
even if you don't live here.

275
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:37,738
Lots of people

276
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:38,898
use this path.

277
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,738
You're blocking the way.

278
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:41,898
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:43,258
Are you okay?

280
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:44,298
I'm fine.

281
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:45,738
Stop. Don't move.

282
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:46,458
My back.

283
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:47,498
I'll help you.

284
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:49,018
Old problem.

285
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,378
Shall I help you upstairs?

286
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:51,378
Thank you,

287
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:53,098
son.

288
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:54,258
Slow down.

289
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:00,018
Ran,

290
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:01,098
get up.

291
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,658
You're sleeping with the TV on
in broad daylight again,

292
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,258
just like your dad

293
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,258
who always wastes.

294
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:09,258
Look at you.

295
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:10,898
All you do at home is eat

296
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:11,538
and sleep.

297
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,418
You gave up dieting again.

298
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,858
Can I just have
a little more sleep at home?

299
00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:21,058
Look at what you do all day.

300
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:22,618
You're not

301
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:25,258
sleeping like a 30-year-old girl at all.

302
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:26,898
That's no lady.

303
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:28,738
Tossing and turning.

304
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:30,018
Let me tell you.

305
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:31,378
If you keep this up,

306
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:34,138
you'll never find
a boyfriend in this life.

307
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,258
Who says I can't find a boyfriend?

308
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:40,138
It must surprise you if I have one.

309
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:42,418
I beg you to surprise me.

310
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:43,498
Get up.

311
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:51,418
I'd better sleep in.

312
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:54,338
Come on. Sir, be careful.

313
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:56,498
Son,

314
00:19:57,138 --> 00:19:59,098
you're here to visit, right?

315
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:00,898
I'm here to see my girlfriend.

316
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:05,178
I saw that you were on the phone.

317
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:07,138
Did you have an unpleasant conversation?

318
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,138
No.

319
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:11,218
Wait, in this building,

320
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:14,018
there's no girl your age.

321
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:16,258
How about this?

322
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,218
Sit at our house for a while.

323
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:19,018
Then

324
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,378
call your girlfriend, okay?

325
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:22,498
Okay, thank you.

326
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:23,778
Be careful.

327
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:26,378
Sir, take your time.

328
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:27,378
Thank you.

329
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:28,898
Here we are.

330
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:32,218
S-Sir,

331
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,098
you live in room 307?

332
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:35,418
Yeah.

333
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:37,418
I seem to have forgotten my key.

334
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:39,858
I'm coming.

335
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:42,098
Come in.

336
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:43,338
Come in, son.

337
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:44,538
This is...

338
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:45,138
Dad.

339
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:45,538
Hello.

340
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:46,818
Didn't I tell you

341
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:47,458
that your back...

342
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:56,978
Hello, my name is Yan Yue.

343
00:20:58,138 --> 00:20:59,218
Yan Yue.

344
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:01,338
Have you had lunch yet?

345
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:02,258
Yes.

346
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:10,018
You're growing, so you digest quickly.

347
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:12,018
Have some fruit.

348
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:12,898
I washed it.

349
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:13,498
Yeah.

350
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,138
Thanks, Mrs. An.

351
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:17,138
Yan, where are you from?

352
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:18,498
What do you do?

353
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:20,218
I'm from Bowen.

354
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:21,618
I'm currently working
as a dubbing artist.

355
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:23,258
Dubbing,

356
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,738
like for movies and TV shows,

357
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:26,498
right?

358
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:27,538
Right.

359
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:30,218
Mainly for games, audiobooks,

360
00:21:30,218 --> 00:21:30,898
radio dramas,

361
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,018
and sometimes some animations.

362
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:34,978
Young people know so much more.

363
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:38,658
I'm good.

364
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:45,338
What were you saying?

365
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:46,418
Nothing much.

366
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:51,618
It is the Mid-Autumn Festival,

367
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:52,618
and her uncle is coming.

368
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:55,138
Since you're here,

369
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,738
Yan,

370
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,378
why don't you stay for dinner tonight?

371
00:21:59,738 --> 00:22:00,498
Sure.

372
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:01,778
Thank you for everything.

373
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,858
I'll cook you some of my best dishes.

374
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:06,378
Let's start preparing now.

375
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:08,258
Ran, come help me.

376
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:08,858
Go.

377
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:09,378
Me?

378
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:10,618
Come on.

379
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:11,858
Don't be so lazy.

380
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:13,378
Yan, I'll leave you two.

381
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:15,578
Come.

382
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:16,298
Son.

383
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,618
How is your back now?

384
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:20,658
Much better.

385
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:24,378
Is he really your boyfriend?

386
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:29,258
How old is he?

387
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,258
25.

388
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,258
25? Isn't that too young?

389
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:37,138
Is he reliable?

390
00:22:38,018 --> 00:22:38,858
Yes.

391
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:39,898
More reliable than me.

392
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:42,098
What about Pei Jun?

393
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:43,538
Didn't he come back?

394
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:45,498
He even called us.

395
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:46,978
Hasn't he contacted you?

396
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:48,858
Can you not mention him, please?

397
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,858
Alright. I won't mention him.

398
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:53,618
Mrs. An,

399
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:55,138
is there anything I can help with?

400
00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:56,378
No need.

401
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:57,138
You are a guest.

402
00:22:57,138 --> 00:22:57,898
Go sit down.

403
00:22:58,218 --> 00:22:59,418
There is.

404
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:01,018
Right, Mrs. An.

405
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:02,018
Leave it to us.

406
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:02,898
You can rest over there.

407
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:05,618
Can you two handle it?

408
00:23:05,938 --> 00:23:08,098
Those potatoes and carrots
have to be peeled.

409
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,138
And I need to season
these chicken wings.

410
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:11,858
The fish hasn't been cleaned yet.

411
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:14,258
Look at these vegetables.
They are not ready yet.

412
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:15,978
No problem.

413
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:17,018
Yan Yue is a great cook.

414
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,098
I wouldn't say a great cook,

415
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,738
but I can show you a trick or two.

416
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:21,898
Just leave it to us.

417
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:23,978
Great cook?

418
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:26,138
Alright,

419
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,018
I'll leave it to you.

420
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:36,978
Why did you come here?

421
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,778
I wanted to see your hometown.

422
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,218
Then why didn't you tell me

423
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:44,418
in advance?

424
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,498
I wanted to surprise you.

425
00:23:47,498 --> 00:23:49,418
I'm afraid it was more like a shock.

426
00:24:01,258 --> 00:24:02,418
What do you think of this?

427
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:05,498
He's just too young.

428
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:08,778
The boy is quite considerate.

429
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:10,498
Earlier downstairs,

430
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:11,498
my back was giving me trouble,

431
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:13,258
and he helped me up.

432
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:17,858
I have to say,

433
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,618
boys like him

434
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:21,258
are young,

435
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:22,738
but they may be

436
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,378
quite reliable.

437
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:27,578
Besides, Ran isn't young anymore.

438
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:29,698
She can't afford to delay.

439
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:32,738
Come on.

440
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:33,618
Give it to me.

441
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:34,978
No need.

442
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:36,498
- Give it to me.
- I can do it.

443
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:38,018
- Just watch.
- I can.

444
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:38,898
Just watch.

445
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:48,218
Jiankang.

446
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:48,976
Greetings.

447
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:50,898
- Take it.
- Oh you shouldn't.

448
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:51,658
Put it here.

449
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:53,658
Jiankang,

450
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:55,538
Ran's boyfriend is here.

451
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,618
You've got a big mouth.

452
00:24:57,778 --> 00:24:59,098
Be more careful later.

453
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:00,578
Ran has got a boyfriend?

454
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:01,738
Keep it down.

455
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:04,058
Keep it down.

456
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:06,178
You'd better not say too much later.

457
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:07,178
I'm telling you.

458
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:09,058
Don't ruin Ran's show.

459
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:12,938
Is it good?

460
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:29,498
Mr. and Mrs. An, thank you

461
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,258
for letting me spend
the festival with you.

462
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:33,138
Here's to you all.

463
00:25:33,138 --> 00:25:34,258
Wish everyone a happy festival.

464
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:35,338
Good.

465
00:25:35,338 --> 00:25:36,098
Happy festival.

466
00:25:36,098 --> 00:25:37,098
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

467
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:37,698
Cheers.

468
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:38,578
Cheers.

469
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,378
I-I'll start then.

470
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:43,138
Let me taste it first.

471
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:45,098
Ah you.

472
00:25:49,418 --> 00:25:49,978
I gotta say,

473
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,258
your cooking has improved

474
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,258
during the time I'm not here!

475
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,138
You can apply for a restaurant chef.

476
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:55,978
Really?

477
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:58,138
Yan Yue did all this.

478
00:26:01,738 --> 00:26:02,898
Let me try.

479
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:09,498
How is it?

480
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:13,258
The cooking time

481
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:16,498
is well-controlled.

482
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:20,738
- Let me try.
- Good.

483
00:26:23,858 --> 00:26:26,538
I didn't expect
your cooking to be so good.

484
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:28,738
You've got some skills
at such a young age.

485
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:29,738
Thank you for the compliments.

486
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:31,738
Ran,

487
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:34,018
when will you cook some good dishes

488
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:35,778
for me and your dad?

489
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:38,818
I'm not opposed to it.

490
00:26:39,338 --> 00:26:39,938
Mrs. An,

491
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,618
I usually cook for An Ran.

492
00:26:42,898 --> 00:26:44,378
Do you two live together?

493
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:46,138
No.

494
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,018
That's not what he meant.

495
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:49,138
We live very close to each other.

496
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:50,898
You brat.

497
00:26:54,498 --> 00:26:55,258
Mr. and Mrs. An,

498
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:57,018
An Ran has a regular schedule.

499
00:26:57,018 --> 00:26:58,018
She works diligently

500
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,098
and has no bad habits,

501
00:26:59,258 --> 00:27:00,258
just except

502
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:01,898
that she doesn't eat on time.

503
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:04,418
But I will do my best
to take care of her

504
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:06,378
and help her get rid of this bad habit.

505
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:07,498
Please rest assured.

506
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:09,138
I will do what I'm supposed to do.

507
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:13,898
Ran is in for a treat then.

508
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:17,738
Let's raise our glasses

509
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:19,258
to celebrate the festival.

510
00:27:19,498 --> 00:27:20,898
Cheers.

511
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:23,378
Come on.

512
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:27,738
Eat.

513
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:29,098
- Let me try this fish.
- Eat.

514
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:29,618
Good.

515
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,418
This looks really good.

516
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,098
Come on.

517
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:39,618
Let's have a chat.

518
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:40,858
Alright.

519
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:42,738
What do you think of it?

520
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:44,618
What?

521
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,618
I'm asking if you're serious.

522
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:50,218
He is not just a year or two
younger than you.

523
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:51,898
Have you thought about this carefully?

524
00:27:58,738 --> 00:27:59,538
An Ran.

525
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,498
Ran, did you hear me?

526
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,138
What? What do you want to ask?

527
00:28:04,338 --> 00:28:05,138
I'm asking you.

528
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:07,538
Why didn't you tell us about this?

529
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,138
What are your future plans?

530
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,258
I didn't plan to tell you

531
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,778
about Yan Yue so soon,

532
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:17,258
mainly because I was afraid
you would worry too much.

533
00:28:18,258 --> 00:28:20,138
But now that he is here,

534
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:22,138
fine, then I'll

535
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:24,498
give you a serious explanation.

536
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:28,138
We decided to be together

537
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:29,378
after deliberation.

538
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:32,018
Yes, he is a few years younger than me.

539
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:33,338
But as you can see,

540
00:28:33,498 --> 00:28:35,138
he is more mature than me in many ways.

541
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:39,498
That's right. He is quite mature.

542
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:44,378
But does his family know?

543
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:47,138
Do they know about the age gap
between you two?

544
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:50,218
They know.

545
00:28:50,858 --> 00:28:52,138
I've met his mother,

546
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,258
and his mother agrees.

547
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:54,978
Really?

548
00:28:57,898 --> 00:28:59,498
Putting myself in her shoes,

549
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:02,218
it's not easy for his mother

550
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:04,378
to agree to you two being together.

551
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:08,898
But, Ran,

552
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:11,378
I'm still quite worried.

553
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:13,498
He's so young.

554
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:15,618
He might not have enough fun yet.

555
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:18,258
What if he thinks it's good now

556
00:29:18,738 --> 00:29:20,138
but changes his mind in the future?

557
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,978
You're not young anymore.

558
00:29:22,418 --> 00:29:24,018
You're a girl.

559
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:25,378
Have you ever thought about it?

560
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:27,018
You can't afford to delay.

561
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:32,018
Mom,

562
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:33,498
actually,

563
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:35,538
after the last relationship,

564
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:37,258
I understood some truths.

565
00:29:38,018 --> 00:29:39,778
To get the life I want,

566
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,018
I can only strive for myself.

567
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,138
I can never rely on others.

568
00:29:44,738 --> 00:29:45,498
So

569
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:48,418
whether he is older or younger,

570
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:49,898
or richer,

571
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:51,018
or more ordinary than me,

572
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:52,738
none of these are that important.

573
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:54,018
What's important

574
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:55,618
is when two people are together,

575
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,258
they can cherish each other,

576
00:29:57,498 --> 00:29:58,738
rely on each other

577
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,378
and accompany each other.

578
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:02,658
Moreover,

579
00:30:02,658 --> 00:30:04,138
Yan Yue has many merits

580
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:05,658
that are worth learning from.

581
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:07,138
He is calmer

582
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,018
and more attentive than me.

583
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:11,818
In short,

584
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,138
he is reliable.

585
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:16,978
My girl has grown up.

586
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,658
Since you've said all this,

587
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,898
you should hold on to it.

588
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:22,858
But you must remember,

589
00:30:23,378 --> 00:30:26,498
whether it's work or relationships,

590
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:28,018
don't be afraid of any difficulties

591
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:29,138
you encounter.

592
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:30,658
You can always come home.

593
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:33,738
Mom.

594
00:30:39,178 --> 00:30:40,738
(Hello, I'm Heisha.)

595
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:43,418
(Is this your first participation...)

596
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:44,138
Ran,

597
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:45,738
look,

598
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,258
isn't this Yan Yue?

599
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,498
Yan Yue's show premieres today.

600
00:30:50,858 --> 00:30:52,778
An, Jiankang,

601
00:30:52,778 --> 00:30:53,858
hurry, come and watch.

602
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:54,458
What's going on?

603
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,178
Come here now!

604
00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:56,458
Look, Yan Yue.

605
00:30:57,978 --> 00:30:58,738
What's going on?

606
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:00,738
I know about this show.

607
00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:01,898
It was quite popular last year.

608
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:03,218
An Ran, I didn't expect

609
00:31:03,218 --> 00:31:04,778
that you've got a superstar boyfriend.

610
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,778
You look so good.

611
00:31:10,778 --> 00:31:11,498
Not bad?

612
00:31:23,338 --> 00:31:24,338
An, look.

613
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,858
He was quite spirited.

614
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:28,418
Yan Yue,

615
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:30,658
why don't you sleep at my home tonight?

616
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:31,898
Okay.

617
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:39,978
Ouch.

618
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,538
Then why did you step forward?

619
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:45,138
I couldn't just let you get bullied.

620
00:31:49,018 --> 00:31:50,498
It hurts. Be gentle.

621
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:54,218
Why didn't you
solve it with money today?

622
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,138
What are you doing?

623
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:03,738
Bai Mengyao,

624
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,138
I used to

625
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,178
treat you as a buddy, as a colleague.

626
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,618
But being with you,

627
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:12,258
whether it's work or eating,

628
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:13,338
I'm very happy.

629
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:15,698
I didn't realize it until now.

630
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,898
I want to be with you,

631
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:19,218
forever.

632
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,698
I apologize

633
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:22,458
for the bad things I did to you before.

634
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:23,738
Bai Mengyao,

635
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:25,418
I want to upgrade

636
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:26,938
our pure camaraderie.

637
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,698
Who wants to upgrade it with you?

638
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,498
Why are you crying?

639
00:32:41,498 --> 00:32:42,978
Did I say something wrong?

640
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:44,258
Forget what I said.

641
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:45,218
Can I take it back?

642
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:46,738
Don't you dare.

643
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:49,738
So, you agree?

646
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:01,938
Yan Yue,

647
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,258
sorry you have to crash here today.

648
00:33:04,498 --> 00:33:06,618
I used to watch TV on the couch,

649
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:07,978
and it was quite comfy.

650
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:11,858
What are you doing?

651
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,618
How old were you in this?

652
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:15,178
So cute.

653
00:33:15,658 --> 00:33:16,698
So silly.

654
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:17,178
Give it to me.

655
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:18,498
Give it to me.

656
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:20,498
Give it to me.

657
00:33:20,978 --> 00:33:23,098
Give it to me.

658
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:25,498
Give me a picture of you as a kid.

659
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:26,458
No.

660
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:28,218
Why should I?

661
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:30,018
Then give me pictures of you as a kid.

662
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:31,018
Ten of yours for one of mine.

663
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:32,858
Then I'll ask your parents for it.

664
00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:35,458
You wouldn't dare.

665
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:37,698
Do I look like I wouldn't dare?

666
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:40,018
Stop fooling around.

667
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:40,898
Time to sleep.

668
00:33:54,738 --> 00:33:56,138
Actually, I came today,

669
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,938
because I missed you too much.

670
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:02,018
Did you miss me?

671
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,858
How dare you.

672
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:34,178
Alright.

673
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:35,218
You don't need to see us out.

674
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:35,938
Wait a moment.

675
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:39,738
This is the sausage
and the salted duck eggs your mom made.

676
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:40,658
Mr. An, let me.

677
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,338
I can carry it.

678
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:42,138
Too much to carry.

679
00:34:42,658 --> 00:34:44,098
You two should have proper meals.

680
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:47,258
Thank you for taking care of Ran.

681
00:34:47,698 --> 00:34:48,338
It's my duty.

682
00:34:50,098 --> 00:34:50,738
And you.

683
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:52,458
Don't stay up late.
It's bad for your health.

684
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:53,938
Did you hear that?

685
00:34:57,418 --> 00:34:58,218
I did.

686
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:01,178
Then we'll be leaving now.

687
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:01,698
Okay.

688
00:35:02,378 --> 00:35:03,738
Call us when you get there.

689
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:04,538
Okay.

690
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:05,098
Okay.

691
00:35:05,698 --> 00:35:06,938
Drive safely.

692
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:07,938
Alright.

693
00:35:16,938 --> 00:35:19,018
Why is the holiday so short?

694
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:21,458
It's only a two-hour drive

695
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,178
back to your hometown.

696
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:24,778
If you get homesick,

697
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:26,538
we can go back anytime.

698
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,138
Yan Yue, thank you.

699
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:41,458
Yan Yue,

700
00:35:42,538 --> 00:35:44,058
(We Who Love Voices Guest Yan Yue)
when did you take this?

701
00:35:45,898 --> 00:35:47,138
The production team let me do so.

702
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:48,498
How is it?

703
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:52,178
Isn't it way too cute?

704
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:53,698
Will you be recognized

705
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:55,378
on the street in the future?

706
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:56,698
It's not that dramatic.

707
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:00,258
An Ran,

708
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:01,538
see your WeChat Moments.

709
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:05,178
What happened?

710
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:08,938
(I will only play games with him/her.)
Hu Yingjun and Bai Mengyao.

711
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:11,258
Bai Mengyao finally got him.

712
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,018
Looks like Hu Yingjun
didn't practice boxing for nothing.

713
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,178
Hu Yingjun, boxing?

714
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:20,458
The power of love.

00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:21,858
Let's go.

717
00:36:30,698 --> 00:36:31,338
