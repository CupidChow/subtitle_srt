00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:49,986
I'm not sure

25
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:50,946
if you know such a person,

26
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,706
who shows one face in public

27
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:56,546
and another when alone.

28
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,266
Miss An,

29
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:59,306
the company's finance
is really tight recently.

30
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:02,106
We've downgraded the equipment
we were supposed to replace,

31
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:03,866
saving a little where we can.

32
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:06,106
This won't work.

33
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:07,226
The tools are not up to par.

34
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:08,906
It will lower the quality
and slow the efficiency.

35
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:10,266
Let Peng choose.

36
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:11,706
Charge it to my credit card.

37
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:12,826
Okay.

38
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:13,840
(In public,)

39
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:17,306
(she appears as a rich woman
who spares no expense.)

40
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,066
(But when alone,)

41
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:20,826
(she's a miser)

42
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,626
who haggles over fifty cents
for half an hour.

43
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:25,626
You threw away my collection
of water bottles

44
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,626
without even asking?

45
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:28,656
They were in my way.

46
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:29,834
I don't care.

47
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,514
They could be sold
for a pack of fine dried noodles.

48
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:31,834
Pay me off.

49
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:35,234
Don't think that you can't hear me
when you're wearing headphones.

50
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:37,154
You think I wouldn't dare
cross this line?

51
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:40,114
(The word "frugal" is written
all over her face.)

52
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,456
(But I know,)

53
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:43,754
(every penny she painstakingly saves)

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,514
(becomes)

55
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:47,714
(Post Text)
(daily expenses in the company ledgers.)

56
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:50,928
(An Ran
seeking good music and websites)

57
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:09,314
Mr. Heisha,

58
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:12,354
what's the name of this song?

59
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:14,874
I wrote it myself.

60
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:16,434
Still being tested.

61
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:19,792
You wrote it?

62
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:21,674
Yes.

63
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:24,240
Can you license it to our game?

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,714
At a slightly cheaper price.

65
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:30,314
Free?

66
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:36,912
No discussion.

67
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:38,960
We're so familiar.

68
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,114
Don't be a stranger.

69
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:51,954
My song only plays in my show.

70
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:52,528
You can go back.

71
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,754
Well, we can negotiate, right?

72
00:03:58,434 --> 00:03:59,274
(If possible,)

73
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,434
(sometimes I want to help her)

74
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:03,474
(achieve these little wishes.)

75
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:38,736
(To An Ran)

00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:56,432
=Episode 3=
(An Ran, You've Changed)

77
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:22,034
Pop in.

78
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,008
It's not good
to keep freeloading your rides.

79
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:27,314
You have done it a lot.

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,754
One more time won't hurt, right?

81
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:31,834
Makes sense.

82
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:49,314
You're a popular voice actor.

83
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,274
Why can't you speak nicely?

84
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:52,754
I think I speak quite well.

85
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,634
Otherwise, why do so many people
listen to me?

86
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:00,354
Can't argue with that.

87
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,864
I'm not recording
in the morning anymore.

88
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,834
Don't schedule me.

89
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:06,834
That won't do.

90
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,354
I've already booked the studio
for next week.

91
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:11,514
I know I've pushed my luck a bit,

92
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:12,354
but could you...?

93
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:14,394
Can't get up.
Even soup dumplings won't help.

94
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:20,058
Is it because of your live show
at night?

95
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:22,898
Why don't you schedule your live show
a bit earlier?

96
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,338
Every day it's so late.

97
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:25,818
I have to stay up with you.

98
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:28,298
Look, my dark circles are so heavy.

99
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:32,176
You need to consider the feelings
of your fans, like me.

100
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:33,338
Mr. Heisha.

101
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,178
Look at Jiang Shan.

102
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:40,898
Jiang Shan is a classic bad example.

103
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:43,538
He just quit a good show,

104
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,778
not considering
the fans' feelings at all.

105
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,498
You know Jiang Shan well.

106
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,832
You're from Jiang Shan's studio.

107
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,778
I need to do some background checks
when working with you.

108
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:02,498
(You can't expect me to record while
you're playing both sides. Dream on.)

109
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,258
(How old are you, Heisha?
Do you have to do this?)

110
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,698
Good morning, everyone.

111
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:18,960
Miss An,

112
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,298
this is the script

113
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,018
I revised based on

114
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:26,298
our meeting yesterday.

115
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,778
Version 6.0.

116
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:29,338
You've stayed up late again?

117
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm already less capable
than everyone else.

118
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,960
I can't be a drag on you.

119
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:37,698
Little Tian Xin is
getting better and better.

120
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:38,258
Well done.

121
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:39,418
Thank you, Miss An.

122
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:41,360
Peng,

123
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,258
we need to speed up
the scene modification.

124
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:44,458
Mr. Wang is pushing for it.

125
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,818
Okay, Miss An.

126
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,152
Hu Yingjun.

127
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,160
We need to hire a concept artist,
Hu Yingjun.

128
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:03,858
Okay, you decide.

129
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,258
Can I not work overtime tonight?

130
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:07,376
You have a date?

131
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:09,298
An angel investor.

132
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:10,418
Isn't that your mom?

133
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:13,072
How is it?

134
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:15,632
Who is it?

135
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:16,400
It's me.

136
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:20,880
There's a bit of beautification in it.

137
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:24,418
Can you send me that photo?

138
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,632
What do you need my photo for?

139
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:29,232
Send it to me, quickly.

140
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:32,298
Let me tell you.

141
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,138
Although our company

142
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,952
has some cash flow issues recently,

143
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,178
I, Hu Yingjun, sell skills, not myself.

144
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:39,058
Then let me tell you.

145
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:40,778
If we don't hire a concept artist soon,

146
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,458
you'll have to pay for Peng's
worker's compensation.

147
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:06,768
I'm here, waiting for you.

148
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:10,386
Isabella, this is their signature

149
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,106
cheese cake. Try it.

150
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:17,186
Excuse me.

151
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,946
Indeed, it's delicious.

152
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:22,186
Didn't you say you ran out of
skincare products last time?

153
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:22,946
Try this one.

154
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,386
Luxury rejuvenation, caviar essence.

155
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:28,746
You even know about caviar essence.

156
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:31,346
You really put in the effort.

157
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:33,746
By the way, sweetheart,

158
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:36,426
how's your company's project going?
Smoothly?

159
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:39,746
It's going fairly smoothly.

160
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:41,186
But as you know,

161
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,866
for us,

162
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:45,986
project development requires
a lot of capital investment.

163
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,586
So,

164
00:09:48,106 --> 00:09:51,866
we especially need an insightful
angel sister like you

165
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,586
to join forces with us.

166
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,666
In this way, we can capture
more market share.

167
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,786
How about it?

168
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:02,306
A young man attached to a wealthy woman.

169
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:03,226
How exciting.

170
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:04,186
No good.

171
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:08,546
Look,

172
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,306
what's the most lacking
in modern society?

173
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,866
It's love.

174
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:13,986
It's different

175
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:15,666
from medical beauty,
fitness, and all that.

176
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,426
It's a real core need.

177
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,426
Sweetheart, do you know?

178
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:21,904
I have a bestie,

179
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,786
who recently met

180
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:25,346
a male net friend online.

181
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:27,346
He immediately asked her for investment.

182
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:30,426
Do you think this is
true love or a scam?

183
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,666
As for me, it's still the same.

184
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,986
You can spend some pocket money,

185
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:37,306
but investment in entrepreneurship
really has risks.

186
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:38,906
What risks does our project have?

187
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,226
You've seen it.

188
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:41,586
Invest 500,000 yuan now.

189
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,306
It will turn into
100 million yuan right away.

190
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:44,346
Latest news,

191
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:46,352
Ms. Zhang invested 500,000 yuan

192
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:47,906
for a male netizen.

193
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,186
She immediately received
over 5,000 yuan in return.

194
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:53,906
Then Ms. Zhang added
another 500,000 yuan investment.

195
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:56,026
The other party
mysteriously disappeared.

196
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:58,346
Could you lower your voice?

197
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:02,186
Young man,

198
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:04,906
making money is about your own
hands and feet.

199
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:06,986
There are not so many shortcuts
in the world.

200
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:10,906
I'm just making it with my own hands.
What's wrong?

201
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,666
I think the young lady is right.

202
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,026
It's getting late.
I have to pick up Tutu.

203
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,306
Take your time to eat.

204
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,106
Don't. Stay a little longer.
We haven't really eaten anything yet.

205
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:22,866
Hello.

206
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:24,106
Miss Bai Mengyao,

207
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,106
when can I see you

208
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:27,666
to discuss something serious?

209
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:31,586
Not now, I'm working on my career.

210
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:33,866
Then wait for me at the old place later.

211
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:35,866
Love you.

212
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:38,426
Yaoyao,

213
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,106
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,346
There was emergency
at the company. I'm late.

215
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:43,706
It's okay. Sit.

216
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:46,746
What do you want to eat today?

217
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:47,666
Anything.

218
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:48,746
Anything will do.

219
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:50,026
Then, I'll order.

220
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,546
Waiter,

221
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,226
we want this set meal

222
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:57,186
and a bottle of this wine.

223
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:58,146
Okay.

224
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,546
Is your company quite busy?

225
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,906
Working in finance,
being busy is normal.

226
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:04,586
You don't mind, do you?

227
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:06,186
No, not at all.

228
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:07,186
Why would I?

229
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,026
Yaoyao,

230
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:11,106
you're back from your honeymoon
with Peng?

231
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:12,546
Who's Peng?

232
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:14,986
Peng, your husband.

233
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,346
What are you talking about?
I don't know him at all.

234
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:19,106
Sis, it's not fun if you act like this.

235
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,226
Didn't you just get married?
I even attended the wedding.

236
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:23,346
I'm telling you, stop calling me Sis.

237
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:24,786
Don't make me accuse you of defamation.

238
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:26,466
Yaoyao,

239
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:29,026
if you continue like this,
I can't just stand by.

240
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:29,746
Stop, stop.

241
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:32,986
Yaoyao, I have something to do.
I'm leaving.

242
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,986
No, wait a minute, wait...

243
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,466
Don't let me run into you again.

244
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,786
I'll beat you every time I see you.

245
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:41,906
Take care, Sis.

246
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:42,906
Wait for me.

247
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:54,346
What's going on?

248
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:56,666
Don't mention it.

249
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:58,746
This afternoon when I was on a date,

250
00:12:58,746 --> 00:12:59,906
I met a weird guy.

251
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,786
He made me so angry that my frown lines
were showing.

252
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,666
What did you want from me?

253
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:09,546
Serious business.

254
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,226
Remember what I mentioned last time?

255
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:14,346
I want to invite you to our company
as a concept artist.

256
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:17,026
Sis, I've told you.

257
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:18,426
I don't want to work.

258
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:19,586
Live streaming is so good.

259
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,866
Flexible income, and freedom.

260
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:23,866
Yaoyao,

261
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,506
you need to have a long-term
perspective.

262
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,866
Our company is about to
take on a big project.

263
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,346
A bright future ahead.

264
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,746
It's not that I don't want to agree.

265
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,906
I just want more

266
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:37,546
free time.

267
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:40,786
We really lack someone like you.

268
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,546
Everyone in our company really
wants you to come.

269
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:47,586
Sis, you've changed.

270
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:49,786
Back in school,

271
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:51,786
you were an aloof goddess.

272
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,426
What goddess?

273
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,666
All that is illusionary.

274
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,466
Supporting the company,
supporting myself,

275
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:06,306
and taking on big projects,
these are real.

276
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:15,666
Let's not talk about that.

277
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:20,336
Let me show you something interesting.

278
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:24,266
Our company's partner,

279
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,946
rich second generation,

280
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:28,506
overseas returnee, 1.85m tall,

281
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:29,706
handsome.

282
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:31,666
Won't you try dating him?

283
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:34,106
Rich second generations
are just entry-level.

284
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:35,906
It's not interesting to date such guys.

285
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:38,546
He's not a typical
rich second generation.

286
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:40,666
He not only has money,
but also with business acumen.

287
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,306
Many of our company's big projects
were brought in by him.

288
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:44,746
If you would come,

289
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,586
career and love will both prosper.

290
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,146
Killing several birds with one stone.

291
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,248
I'm a bit interested.

292
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:53,986
Keep talking.

293
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:56,866
Are there any other photos?

294
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,826
I guess that's all I have to say.

295
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,546
Just think about it.

296
00:15:02,706 --> 00:15:03,346
That's all?

297
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:04,666
Pay the bill.

298
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:07,546
You're leaving just like that?

299
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:12,586
So heartless.

300
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,986
The last part, in one fell swoop.

301
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,064
(Heisha Time Streaming)

302
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,826
(Ever since my show
was adjusted to late-night,)

303
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:44,066
(everyone's biological clock
seems to have been delayed.)

304
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:47,746
So, I will initiate a vote
in the fan group.

305
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:49,680
If more than half of the people

306
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,866
agree to move the time
forward by an hour,

307
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,066
I'll consider adjusting it.

308
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:58,266
(Afterwards, I'll draw some fans
for goodnight audios.)

309
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:02,026
(I vote for an hour earlier.)

310
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:10,866
(Please vote
through the proper channels.)

311
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:12,546
Naughty kid.

Hasn't the project World of Imagination
already ended?

320
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,906
Why are you bringing me
to see your client?

321
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:47,226
Mr. Heisha, the client specifically
invited you.

322
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:49,186
You've made such a big contribution
this time.

323
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:52,346
How could we miss you
at this celebration?

324
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:03,986
This way, please.

325
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,426
Miss An.

326
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:08,426
Mr. Wang.

327
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:11,106
We should have met earlier.

328
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:11,786
It's my fault.

329
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,666
Miss An, you're a busy woman.

330
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,226
It's not easy to meet you.

331
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,426
Not at all.

332
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:23,346
Nowadays, young girls
like to do manicures.

333
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:25,466
There aren't many as simple as you.

334
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:26,986
Li,

335
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,346
can you turn up
the air conditioning temperature a bit?

336
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:31,306
Miss An is not wearing much.

337
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:32,666
Is it a bit cold here?

338
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,186
Mr. Wang.

339
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:39,586
This must be Mr. Heisha, right?

340
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,306
Yes, yes, Mr. Heisha.

341
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:42,906
I forgot to introduce him just now.

342
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,346
The "World of Imagination" event

343
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:45,986
depends on the popularity of Mr. Heisha.

344
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,986
Nice to meet you. I've been wanting
to thank you in person.

345
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:52,426
This is my planner, Tian Xin.

346
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,186
Tian Xin, nice name.

347
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:59,346
Last month, our team took over the game

348
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:00,586
"World of Imagination".

349
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:02,226
(Results Review)
The entire team immediately

350
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,906
threw themselves into production.

351
00:18:04,226 --> 00:18:05,066
Take a look.

352
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:06,306
First of all,

353
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:09,546
we improved its lines and plot.

354
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,226
Mr. Wang, look,

355
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:28,466
we completed the task
with guarantee of quality and quantity.

356
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:29,826
The effect was very good.

357
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:31,066
Well, you...

358
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:32,946
We should thank your team.

359
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:34,626
Yeah.

360
00:18:34,626 --> 00:18:35,546
Your contribution.

361
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:38,320
The final payment for this project...

362
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:40,752
The final payment not paid yet?

363
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,306
Not yet, it's still in process.

364
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,066
Hurry up.

365
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:46,466
Okay.

366
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:48,226
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:49,066
No, no.

368
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:51,106
Thank you for your recent work.

369
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:52,706
I should thank you.

370
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:54,666
Then we'll go back first.

371
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:58,906
Miss An.

372
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:01,066
Is there anything else?

373
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:02,466
I think

374
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,586
our cooperation this time
was very pleasant.

375
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:06,786
Our company has another S-level
project coming up.

376
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:08,226
It's called "Treasure Pavilion".

377
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:09,666
It has already begun bidding.

378
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,706
The scale of this project

379
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:12,586
is much larger than the previous one.

380
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:15,826
I think your team is very creative.

381
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:18,306
I don't know if you're interested
in participating in the bid?

382
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:21,586
This project is so good.

383
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,960
We are certainly interested.

384
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:24,186
That's great.

385
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,346
Then I'll have my secretary
send you some information.

386
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:28,266
But you need to hurry

387
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,146
because the deadline for registration...

388
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:34,706
Miss An,

389
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,666
I'll go back and change clothes first?

390
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,106
Sure, see you at the office then.

391
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,586
Go back and inform Hu Yingjun.

392
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:43,306
Not to be late for the company dinner.

393
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:44,586
No problem.

394
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:45,186
I'm leaving.

395
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:46,106
Bye.

396
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:56,946
Our company is finally
going to make money this time.

397
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:00,826
But we still need

398
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,826
you to renew the contract with us.

399
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,546
Don't worry.
You won't be left out of this.

400
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,906
Having hot pot at this time

401
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,346
is a bit too early, right?

402
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,586
Don't change the subject.

403
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:19,306
Is this project a must-do?

404
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:23,826
Last time it was for the company.
What about this time?

405
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:26,666
What's so good
about this old man's project?

406
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,106
This time it's also for the company.

407
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,386
We must bring in revenue
for the company, right?

408
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,986
As for that old fox,
I know how to handle him.

409
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:42,666
Don't worry, boy.

410
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:46,306
Besides, I didn't let you
make money last time.

411
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:48,066
This time I have to make up for it.

412
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:49,826
Otherwise, it wouldn't be my style
of doing business.

413
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,826
You weren't like this before.

414
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:58,186
Me? Before?

415
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:01,066
Anyway, I won't go along with it.

416
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:04,746
No, you will, you will,
you are very suitable.

417
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,386
Why not reconsider?

418
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:08,186
Reconsider, reconsider.

419
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:12,106
Let's go get something to eat first.
Come on.

420
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:12,826
I'm not going.

421
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:14,986
A lot of people are waiting for you.

422
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:16,746
Mr. Heisha,

423
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:17,506
what do you want to eat?

424
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,066
Spicy oil, spicy oil.

425
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,706
Then I'll cook you some kidney slices.

426
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:27,666
The table is set?

427
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:28,586
- Miss An.
- Hello, Miss An.

428
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:29,426
Hello, hello.

429
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:32,066
This is where we usually have meetings.

430
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:33,346
Not bad, right?

431
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:35,346
This is our office area.

432
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:36,426
Miss An.

433
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,706
Hi.

434
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:39,306
How is it? Not bad, right?

435
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,106
Not bad. It has a certain charm.

436
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:43,466
You didn't design this yourself,

437
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:44,866
did you, art genius?

438
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:46,906
What we have the most of
is artsy youngsters.

439
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,186
Look over here.

440
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:52,906
Your cubicle.

441
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:54,266
Try it out.

442
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:57,306
Not bad.

443
00:21:57,306 --> 00:21:58,608
Not bad, right?

444
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:01,066
I need to think about
how to decorate it.

445
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:07,826
Is that Mr. Hu you mentioned?

446
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:10,706
He looks good from one side.

447
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:14,906
Interested?

448
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:18,346
I just want to make a friend.

449
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:20,946
I just got back from abroad
and have no one to play with.

450
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:22,946
How is he?

451
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:24,866
Didn't I tell you before?

452
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:26,586
If our company didn't have Mr. Hu,

453
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:27,706
we wouldn't have been able to hold on.

454
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:30,826
Rich and righteous Mr. Hu,

455
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:31,906
not bad.

456
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:33,146
What's up, miser?

457
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:35,586
You were after my money before.
Now you're after me?

458
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:39,066
It's you?

459
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:39,906
You know each other?

460
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:41,066
Yes.

461
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:43,066
This is the culprit
of my financing failure.

462
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:45,306
Now courting a rich woman
is called financing, huh?

463
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:46,466
Be careful, An Ran.

464
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,426
Your partner is a conman.
He lives off women.

465
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:49,466
I live off women?

466
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:50,946
Besides, did I live off your family?

467
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:52,066
You did live off a woman.

468
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:53,066
Which rich woman?

469
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:53,826
Isabella.

470
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,906
Yes, that Isabella.

471
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:56,986
That's his mother.

472
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,346
Your mother?

473
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:05,066
Come on, let me say a few words.

474
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:08,146
Today, with the occasion
of Mr. Hu's hot pot,

475
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:09,506
let's officially welcome

476
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:11,746
Bai Mengyao to join our team.

477
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:14,906
Nice to meet you all.

478
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:16,866
Let me introduce them to Yaoyao.

479
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:18,506
This is...

480
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:20,866
You've met.

481
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:22,786
This is our Finance Manager, Wu.

482
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:23,506
Hello.

483
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:24,226
Changfeng.

484
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:25,626
In college...

485
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:26,906
We've met.

486
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,866
I remember.

487
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:28,866
Now he's a programmer.

488
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:32,266
This is Tian Xin, our planner.

489
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:33,266
Graphic designer, Peng.

490
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:35,266
What's his name?

491
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:36,266
Peng.

492
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,386
Peng?

493
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:38,986
Your boyfriend.

494
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:42,506
Can't remember? Isn't he handsome?

495
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:43,946
Are you sick?

496
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:44,626
You have medicine?

497
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:46,746
Alright, alright, stop arguing.

498
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:47,866
I haven't finished yet.

499
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:51,266
This is our voice actor, Mr. Heisha.

500
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:52,586
Mr. Heisha.

501
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:56,506
I feel like I've seen him somewhere.

502
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:00,426
Alumni meeting, boyfriend.

503
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:01,546
An Ran.

504
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:02,026
Boyfriend?

505
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:02,506
Is he?

506
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:03,186
Boyfriend.

507
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:04,226
That day.

508
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:04,866
An Ran, right?

509
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,586
Boyfriend?

510
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,626
Misunderstanding.

511
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:12,626
Mr. Heisha was righteous.

512
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:15,226
He helped us out
and brought in investments.

513
00:24:15,506 --> 00:24:17,106
We are purely friends.

514
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:18,986
Don't spread false information
without understanding.

515
00:24:19,106 --> 00:24:20,586
You misunderstood and you're blaming me?

516
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:22,386
Oh, there's a main business today.

517
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:24,986
We sincerely invite Mr. Heisha

518
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:26,026
to continue working with us.

519
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:27,026
Right.

520
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:28,266
Thank you, Mr. Heisha.

521
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:29,306
I haven't agreed yet.

522
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:38,306
It doesn't matter.

523
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,706
Anyway, we just want to thank you

524
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:42,266
for your help during this period.

525
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:43,506
Right, right.

526
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:44,266
I propose a toast.

527
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:44,866
Well,

528
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,786
new friends and old friends
are gathering together.

529
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:48,946
Let's celebrate.

530
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:49,146
Okay.

531
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:49,706
Okay?

532
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:50,546
Come on, come on.

533
00:24:50,946 --> 00:24:52,626
Come on, thank you, Mr. Heisha.

534
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:53,346
Welcome, welcome.

535
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:54,866
Welcome Bai Mengyao.

536
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:55,546
Welcome.

537
00:24:58,346 --> 00:24:59,746
Sit, sit, sit down.

538
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:08,746
An Ran.

539
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,506
You are really purely friends?

540
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,266
I think he's quite handsome.

541
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:15,746
I like this type.

542
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:17,146
If you don't like him, I'll go for him.

543
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:19,266
Which type don't you like?

544
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:20,986
That's right.

545
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:22,906
If you want to woo him, just do it.

546
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:32,080
You are even interested in a kid.

547
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:33,906
I'm also a kid.

548
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:37,106
Come on, there are so many
good things today.

549
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:39,106
Let's toast again!

550
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:39,986
Okay.

551
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:40,426
Come on.

552
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:41,146
Come on.

553
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,026
Come on, come on, welcome.

554
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:43,946
So cute.

555
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:46,706
Come on.

556
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:47,746
Cheers.

557
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:48,786
Cheers.

558
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,626
Come on.

559
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:55,706
Is this cooked yet?

560
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,146
When the balls float up, they're cooked.

561
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:02,466
I brought milk tea for everyone
on my first day at work.

562
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,506
Feel free to take it.

563
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:04,506
There are all kinds of flavors.

564
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:05,706
Thank you, Mengyao.

565
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:06,906
Thank you. You're so thoughtful.

566
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:09,626
Sorry, it seems I forgot
to buy one for Mr. Hu.

567
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:14,986
Just kidding. I'm not as petty as you.

568
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:17,346
Work hard.

569
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:19,786
Give it to me.

570
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:21,626
Check the phone.

571
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,866
World of Imagination is
on the list of today's popular games.

572
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,106
Didn't expect that.

573
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:34,346
Didn't expect this project
could make money.

574
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:36,506
We're first on the popularity list.

575
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:38,386
We're amazing.

576
00:26:38,386 --> 00:26:40,986
On my first day at the company,
we're first on the popularity list.

577
00:26:40,986 --> 00:26:42,586
Seems like I'm the lucky star
of the company.

578
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,226
What's this got to do with you?

579
00:26:46,352 --> 00:26:48,386
To be honest, I really didn't expect

580
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:49,986
"World of Imagination" to achieve

581
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:51,266
such good results.

582
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:53,584
It shows our production capabilities
are not bad.

583
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:55,826
Yaoyao has joined our team now.

584
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,586
Our team has another capable member.

585
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:00,306
If we make money in the future,

586
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:02,506
we can continue to develop
"Fragment Time Boyfriend".

587
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,506
The final payment
for World of Imagination is here.

588
00:27:05,746 --> 00:27:07,626
Let's just distribute
bonuses to everyone.

589
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:08,746
Great.

590
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:09,466
Alright.

591
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:12,266
It's an outsourcing project.
The money won't be much.

592
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,106
Never mind.

593
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:14,986
Bro,

594
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:16,506
what about Treasure Pavilion?

595
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:17,906
How did it go with Yan Yue?

596
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:19,346
He rejected me.

597
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,146
So I say,

598
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:23,266
the company still has to rely on me.

599
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,866
Never mind. I'll handle it.

600
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,466
I'm going back. See you tomorrow.

601
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:45,106
Mengyao, it's not time yet.

602
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:47,546
Technically, this can't even
be considered leaving early.

603
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,066
It's simply skipping work.

604
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:49,506
Right.

605
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:51,706
But I've already finished the drawings
due tomorrow.

606
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:53,786
I can't finish them

607
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:56,186
even from morning to night.

608
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:57,186
Mengyao,

609
00:27:57,706 --> 00:27:59,346
although we're a small company,

610
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:01,426
we still have quality standards.

611
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:02,546
We can't slack off.

612
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:03,666
Who's slacking off?

613
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,706
Don't believe me? Come and see.

614
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:13,146
Really finished.

615
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,666
Mengyao,

616
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:16,240
at your speed,

617
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:17,786
you're like a printing machine.

618
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:19,506
This style!

619
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:21,866
This style is really unique.

620
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:22,706
Who's your teacher?

621
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:23,786
Do you have a portfolio?

622
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:24,826
Can you teach me in the future?

623
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:26,266
If not today, tomorrow would be fine.

624
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,346
- Sorry.
- Calm down.

625
00:28:27,426 --> 00:28:28,146
Calm down.

626
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:30,826
Sorry about that. He's always like this.

627
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:33,306
Okay, Mengyao,

628
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,906
once you've joined us,

629
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,266
our game can reach new heights.

630
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:38,146
Peng,

631
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:39,426
you won't have to stay up late.

632
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:40,426
No problem.

633
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:42,506
But I usually do more sketching.

634
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:44,026
My style is not as delicate as Peng's.

635
00:28:44,426 --> 00:28:45,266
In the future,

636
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,626
please give me instructions, Peng.

637
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,666
Okay, okay.

638
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:51,706
Sorry.

639
00:28:58,466 --> 00:28:59,146
Where are you going?

640
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:01,146
Why are you asking?

641
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:02,306
Where are you going? It's working hours.

642
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,666
I've finished my work.
It's normal to clock out.

643
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:05,666
What about you?

644
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:08,506
I'm going to exercise my duties
as the company leader.

645
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,386
To bite the bullet
for the company's development.

646
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:13,026
What bullet?

647
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:14,546
An Ran can't bite it,

648
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:15,626
but it requires you to bite?

649
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,426
Mooching?

650
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:19,026
You...

651
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:23,946
Don't even say it.

652
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,186
This is a bullet that I must bite.

653
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:28,426
Because the voiceover teacher
for our project

654
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:30,306
is my buddy.

655
00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:32,306
You're going to see Mr. Heisha?

656
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:33,906
Take me with you, will you?

657
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,666
What are you going for?

658
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:37,786
To exercise my duties as a beauty.

659
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,546
To contribute to the company.

660
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:40,946
Please, Mr. Hu.

661
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:50,706
Let me tell you.

662
00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:52,386
Today is serious business.

663
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,146
Whether Yan Yue can do the voiceover
for Treasure Pavilion

664
00:29:54,146 --> 00:29:54,986
depends on today.

665
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:56,746
If you insist on coming,
don't mess things up.

666
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:58,226
Okay, okay, Mr. Hu.

667
00:29:58,226 --> 00:29:59,626
You've been nagging all the way.

668
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:00,946
I promise you, okay?

669
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:01,946
Let's go.

670
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:03,906
Be sensible.

671
00:30:07,946 --> 00:30:08,786
Hi, Yan Yue.

672
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,306
Mr. Heisha, long time no see.

673
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:14,386
How come you look skinnier
after just two days?

674
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:17,026
What are you here for?

675
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:19,186
I'm here to visit the set.
She is just here to join in the fun.

676
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:21,186
I brought you milk tea.

677
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,186
What flavor do you like?

678
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:25,306
Thanks, no milk tea.

679
00:30:25,986 --> 00:30:26,786
You don't drink milk tea?

680
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:27,946
It doesn't matter.

681
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:29,872
Next time,
I'll bring you something else.

682
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:30,906
Let me tell you...

683
00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:32,146
Enough, stop messing around.

684
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,186
He can't drink milk tea
before recording.

685
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:35,306
It messes up his throat.

686
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:36,826
Sorry, Yan Yue.
This idiot doesn't understand.

687
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:40,146
Where's An Ran?
Why didn't she come today?

688
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:41,946
Miser An has run off to a project.

689
00:30:42,066 --> 00:30:42,906
Been super busy recently.

690
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:46,706
Everyone is here.

691
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:48,906
How's your recording going?

692
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:50,706
I'm about to start.

693
00:30:51,146 --> 00:30:52,186
Alright, hurry up.

694
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,026
Jiang Shan is coming soon.

695
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,186
Jiang Shan is coming?

696
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:57,146
Yes, I'm leaving first.

697
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:59,666
If I had known,
I should have dragged An Ran here.

698
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:01,546
She's been a fan of Jiang Shan
for ten years.

699
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,266
Right?

700
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:08,426
I just lectured Miser An a few days ago.

701
00:31:08,426 --> 00:31:10,306
How can she be a fan
of two people at the same time?

702
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:11,946
Have milk tea, and take a break.

703
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:12,826
I don't drink it.

704
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:15,906
Being a fan of two people
at the same time is disloyal.

705
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:17,706
So now she's only a fan of you.

706
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,906
So, please consider
the Treasure Pavilion.

707
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,746
I won't dub for Mr. Wang's project.

708
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:25,306
I need to memorize the lines.

709
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,186
No problem, go ahead.

710
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,026
Well, we will leave first.

711
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:31,666
The project is not urgent.
You can consider it.

712
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:33,264
We're leaving just like this?

713
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,786
Let's go. He needs to work.

714
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:35,426
Stay longer...

715
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:46,666
With all your chatter,
you've screwed it up.

716
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:48,426
What does it have to do with me?

717
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:49,946
It's clearly you
who can't win him over.

718
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,706
What do you mean
it has nothing to do with you?

719
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:52,786
From today on,

720
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,706
I'll change your name to Huang Mengyao.
[*Huang sounds like "messing up" in Chinese]

721
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,546
What does that mean?

722
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:56,906
What does it mean?

723
00:31:57,026 --> 00:31:59,026
You've messed up everything.
You should be called Huang Mengyao.

724
00:31:59,026 --> 00:32:02,026
I think you might as well
change your name to Nonsense.

725
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:03,546
Don't like it, huh?

726
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,506
How about I change one for you?

727
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,826
Dahuang? Ahuang?

728
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:11,186
Yueyue,

729
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:13,546
what a coincidence.

730
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:15,346
Is it?

731
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:15,946
It is.

732
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:16,746
Are you off work?

733
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:19,226
I have something.

734
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,416
Judging from your expression,
it must be no good.

735
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:27,056
A friend of mine wants
to release a song.

736
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:28,666
Very talented.

737
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:30,466
It's just that the singing
is a bit off-key.

738
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:32,048
I thought about it.

739
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:33,466
You're the only one who could

740
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:35,280
turn a pig's squeal
into a heavenly sound.

741
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,520
This time, which girlfriend is it?

742
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:40,026
This one is different.

743
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:42,346
She's been my fan for ten years.

744
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:45,786
Really, ten years.

745
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:48,866
Let's help her, okay?

746
00:33:04,826 --> 00:33:06,306
(Is this project a must-do?)

747
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:08,466
(This time it's also for the company.)

748
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:11,226
We must bring in revenue
for the company, right?

749
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:12,826
(I know how to handle him.)

750
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:14,706
(Don't worry, boy.)

751
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,306
(Which type don't you like?)

752
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:19,106
If you want to woo him, just do it.

753
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:22,946
(You are even interested in a kid.)

754
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:25,626
(She really doesn't remember anymore)

755
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,666
(and treats me
like a clueless little boy.)

756
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:32,386
(About today,)

757
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:34,506
(I...)

758
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:40,624
(Yan Yue and An Ran's
WeChat conversation)

759
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:44,946
(I know asking you
to do Treasure Pavilion)

760
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:46,306
(is taking advantage of you.)

761
00:33:46,826 --> 00:33:49,226
(But now I don't have other choices.)

762
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:50,586
(Our company...)

763
00:33:54,186 --> 00:33:56,586
How can I get him to do the voiceover?

764
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:59,082
(Typing)

765
00:33:59,826 --> 00:34:00,946
(What does she want to say?)

766
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:07,266
(It's really not good
to keep asking him like this.)

767
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:22,256
I will be shameless one more time today.

768
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:45,786
What's up?

769
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:48,546
Look, what is this?

770
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:50,346
This set of comic books

771
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:52,586
was my favorite when I was in school.

772
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:55,466
I've treasured this original version
until now.

773
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,666
I know you also like
Disaster Star Lovers.

774
00:35:00,826 --> 00:35:01,346
Come in.

775
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:15,626
How do you know
I like Disaster Star Lovers?

776
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:17,808
(Disaster Star Lovers)

777
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,106
I'm good at observation, right?

778
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:22,906
If...

779
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:25,706
If you're willing to continue
working with us,

780
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,706
I'll give you this set of books.

781
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,386
How about it?

782
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,626
How do you know I don't have it?

783
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:34,386
You have it?

784
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:38,586
No.

785
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,866
Then consider it more carefully.

786
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:51,186
What's so good about working
with such a person?

787
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,386
Is making money that important?

788
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,826
If you're really struggling with rent,

789
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,146
you don't need to rush to pay me.

790
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:04,906
As a renter, I thank you.

791
00:36:07,146 --> 00:36:10,346
But making money is indeed
very important to me.

792
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:13,466
You're still young.
You might not understand.

793
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:15,466
I have no choice in this matter.

794
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:24,786
Please rest.
I won't disturb you anymore.
