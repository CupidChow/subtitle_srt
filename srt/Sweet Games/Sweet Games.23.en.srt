=Sweet Games =

24
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:51,882
I've thought
of three marriage proposal plans.

25
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:52,602
Listen.

26
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,882
One is the romantic type,

27
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:57,682
then the low-key luxury type,

28
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:58,882
and finally the cheesy humor type.

29
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:00,042
What do you think, which one?

30
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,162
None.

31
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:04,962
Let me explain each one.

32
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:06,802
The first one, the romantic type.

33
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:09,042
I plan to rent a large yacht,

34
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,802
and then the two of you on the deck

35
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:12,802
hold hands as the sun sets.

36
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:16,042
Cliché.

37
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:18,162
How can this be cliché?

38
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:19,242
My heart will go on.

39
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,802
Okay, let's look at the second one,

40
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:23,922
the low-key luxury type.

41
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:25,922
At that time, just like in the company,

42
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,442
everyone seems to be working,

43
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:29,362
and then you suddenly
appear and whip out

44
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:30,642
a big diamond ring.

45
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:32,082
How about it?

46
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:32,482
Stun her

47
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:33,882
with a big diamond ring.

48
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,042
It might scare her.

49
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:37,482
Okay, let's go to the third one,

50
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:38,762
the cheesy humor type.

51
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:39,802
I believe this one suits you.

52
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:40,802
Invite Nan, Changfeng

53
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:41,602
and An Ran.

54
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:42,082
Then

55
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,482
imagine we're playing a game

56
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:47,202
on the basketball court.

57
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:48,802
We're all playing like losers,

58
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,482
and then you suddenly appear.

59
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,362
Pay attention.

60
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:54,922
I'm talking business.

61
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:56,362
Then you suddenly appear

62
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,162
and accidentally bump into her.

63
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:00,882
What do you think?

64
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,202
A glance back,

65
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:04,482
and the sweetest campus love starts.

66
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:06,082
I don't play basketball.

67
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,362
Okay, I have a fourth one,

68
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:11,642
the Plants vs. Zombies type.

69
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,402
(Girls always complain
that their boyfriends' ideas)

70
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:16,922
(are not special enough,)

71
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:18,642
(even less romantic.)

72
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:21,722
(But is there a possibility)

73
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,722
(that they have thought about it,)

74
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:27,362
(but their imagination
is really limited,)

75
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:30,202
(and they are not aware of this?)

76
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,522
I don't want her
to think it's terrifying

77
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:35,802
every time she recalls it.

78
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:40,762
Give me another one.

79
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:43,202
No, think about it.

80
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:44,202
Why do boys always ask

81
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:45,322
girls out to watch horror movies?

82
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:49,040
=Episode 23=
(Will You Marry Me?)

83
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,082
Anyway, the overall promotion plan

84
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:53,082
is like this.

85
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:53,962
I think it's okay.

86
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:54,522
How about you?

87
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:55,082
Sure.

88
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:56,642
Wait. Stop.

89
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:58,722
What are you here for?

90
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:00,362
What?

91
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:01,202
For Miss An.

92
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:02,122
Do you have an appointment?

93
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:02,842
Do you?

94
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,362
An Ran.

95
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:03,962
You want to...?

96
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,082
Let's talk somewhere else.

97
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:09,922
Sure.

98
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:15,242
What's going on?

99
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:22,242
Miss An, it has a nice view here.

100
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:23,642
Mr. Zhao, get to the point.

101
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:32,802
An Ran,

102
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:35,082
I think this matter

103
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:36,802
should end here.

104
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:40,682
What matter are you referring to?

105
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:45,962
It's about the hacker attack.

106
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:47,802
You drop it,

107
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,242
and Gaishi Group will compensate you.

108
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:51,962
And the compensation

109
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:54,242
will be much more than your losses.

110
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:58,962
In fact, dragging it on

111
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:00,242
doesn't make any sense.

112
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:01,922
No matter

113
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,242
how much you go on with this,

114
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:05,882
it won't benefit you in any way.

115
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:07,362
Here's the deal.

116
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:09,962
As long as you agree to drop the case,

117
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,242
whatever you want in the future,
publishing costs, cooperation,

118
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:15,602
and server costs,

119
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,882
I will solve them for you.

120
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:22,602
Who are you representing now?

121
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:25,202
Of course, it's the Gaishi Group.

122
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:26,962
Given your current situation,

123
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:28,482
can you still represent Gaishi Group?

124
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:31,042
No problem at all.

125
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:33,042
Gaishi Group hasn't made

126
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,762
any statement yet.

127
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:35,922
Why?

128
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:39,922
Or should I say,

129
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:42,482
this matter was your personal behavior

130
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,762
from the beginning to the end?

131
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,242
Now everything is exposed.

132
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,762
Gaishi Group doesn't want
to protect you at all.

133
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:00,522
Miss An,

134
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:02,882
I hope you can be magnanimous.

135
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,242
Please don't stoop to my level.

136
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:05,242
Here's the deal.

137
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:06,962
Whatever you ask,

138
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:08,682
I'll try my best to meet your needs.

139
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,962
Still playing these tricks with me now?

140
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,042
You dare to offer,
but I dare not to accept.

141
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,522
Alright, Mr. Zhao.

142
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:18,322
I think there's no need
for us to talk nonsense.

143
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:20,162
Your pleading is useless.

144
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:22,882
And I already know

145
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,482
the police have started
the investigation.

146
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:34,922
Miss An,

147
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,882
can't you help me?

148
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:44,202
I can't.

149
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:48,762
From the moment
you used despicable means

150
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:51,082
to ruin others' dreams,

151
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,282
no one can help you.

152
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:59,082
You'd better think about

153
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:01,442
how to live your life

154
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:02,642
from now on.

155
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:32,642
You dare to offer,
but I dare not to accept.

156
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:32,962
It is...

157
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:33,962
So cool.

158
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:35,202
I've rehearsed.

159
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:35,962
Amazing.

160
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:37,762
No.

161
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:39,722
Let's applaud for Miss An.

162
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:42,962
Flowers and applause.

163
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,082
Hooray.

164
00:07:53,202 --> 00:07:54,642
(In response to the recent controversy,)

165
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,962
(the Gaishi Group
makes the following statement:)

166
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:58,762
(After our investigation,)

167
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:00,082
(it's confirmed that Zhao,)

168
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:02,962
(a senior executive of Gaishi Group,
engaged in bad business competition)

169
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,882
(through improper means
of business acquisition.)

170
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,882
(We have been cooperating)

171
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:08,762
(with the police investigation.)

172
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:11,082
(Zhao's behavior
represents only himself,)

173
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,962
(and the group was not aware of it.)

174
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:15,082
(We have immediately taken actions)

175
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,522
(including dismissal and suspension)

176
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:18,522
(for the related personnel involved.)

177
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:19,322
Serves him right.

178
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:22,442
(And they were turned over
to the relevant departments.)

179
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,882
(We deeply apologize)

180
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:26,322
(for this incident.)

181
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,442
(We'll strengthen
the internal management)

182
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:31,082
(to prevent similar events)

183
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:32,962
(from happening again within the group.)

184
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:34,322
(And we will compensate)

185
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:37,122
(the game companies)

186
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:39,882
(that have been harmed
not only financially.)

187
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:41,882
(Upon investigation, Zhao)

188
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,642
(played a role in the copyright incident
of JS Sound Art Studio)

189
00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:46,442
(by manipulating public opinion,)

190
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,642
(which severely affected
the reputation of Mr. Heisha)

191
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:51,202
(and the entire JS Sound Art Studio.)

192
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:52,882
(We hereby apologize for...)

193
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,882
I turned it around!

194
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:56,402
Shan.

195
00:08:57,522 --> 00:08:58,722
I turned it around!

196
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:02,442
I turned it around!

197
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:47,442
Finally, it's over.

198
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,202
Finally, it's over.

199
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,722
It's 7 AM now.

200
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,522
I'm about to start my warm-up.

201
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:21,722
What about you?

202
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:23,602
Do you want to run with me?

203
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,322
The weather is just right.

204
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,402
I want to run with you on the field.

205
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:28,522
Walking is also fine.

206
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:32,522
How could you be Heisha?

207
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:35,082
Mr. Heisha, glad to work with you.

208
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,202
You don't seem glad.

209
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:40,202
Sorry. Again.

210
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:41,842
Do you want a throat lozenge

211
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:43,122
to ease the discomfort?

212
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:46,962
I can help with the dubbing of the demo.

213
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:48,762
Who says I won't do it?

214
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:52,322
On this lonely night,

215
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:54,122
I hope that you, busy as you are,

216
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:56,562
have an extra hour of love every day.

217
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:04,082
Was my dubbing just now okay?

218
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:07,282
I think the first half
of that sentence just now

219
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:08,442
can be done again.

220
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:09,962
What do you think, Mr. Heisha?

221
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,842
Okay, then I'll try again.

222
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,882
These are the projects
that have come in recently.

223
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,002
My golden geese, take a look.

224
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:39,962
These guys

225
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,882
wanted to work with us
before the copyright issue,

226
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,562
and they have come back to us
in the last few days.

227
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:45,522
See if you're interested.

228
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:46,962
I've got some projects

229
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:48,562
from my friends too.

230
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,122
I took a brief look the other day.

231
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:53,882
What do you guys think of this one?

232
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:54,960
(Project plan)

233
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:58,762
You're capable now.

234
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:00,522
You can bring in projects
for the company.

235
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:02,722
Take a look.

236
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:08,122
An oral movie for the blind.

237
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,442
It's a charity project
for narrating a movie to blind people.

238
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:11,962
I want to do this.

239
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:14,522
This is not bad.

240
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:15,602
Nan, you take a look.

241
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,242
Let me toast you.

242
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:19,682
Cheers.

243
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:24,522
I'll go ask.

244
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:25,962
Is it okay?

245
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:42,202
Are you ready?

246
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:45,762

I asked about that project.

303
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:36,362
I've heard that several voice actors
want to participate.

00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:37,842
Isn't that great?

afraid of competition.

306
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:44,082
But don't worry.

307
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,482
This project doesn't have
any copyright issues.

308
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:50,082
And allowing blind people
to see images through sound.

309
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:51,202
Seriously,

310
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:52,962
this project
is actually quite meaningful.

311
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:55,082
I didn't expect you to be so interested

312
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:55,922
in this charity project.

313
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:57,962
It's too small.

314
00:15:59,282 --> 00:15:59,962

315
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:00,842

316

317
00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:05,202
with the intention to benefit society.

318
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:12,922

00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,522

324
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,642

for a new project today.

00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:40,922
Alright, then you carry on.

326
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,122
I won't disturb you.

327

00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:11,282

00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:20,562
Interested?

331
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,642
In a couple of days,
I'm going to visit a blind center.

332
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:28,442
Do you want to come with me?

333
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:29,922

334
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:30,522
Of course.

335
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:33,002
Great, then I'll go with you to learn.

336
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:53,522
Have some water.

337
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:00,282
Yaoyao,

338
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:02,882
take a day off tomorrow
and meet my parents with me.

339
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:07,162
Are you okay?

340
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,162
What?

341
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,762
My parents are very easy
to get along with.

342
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:16,922
What should I wear?

343
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:17,282
I...

344
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:18,402
I'm not sure...

345
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,282
You can wear anything.

346
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:20,162
You look good in anything.

347
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:27,642
My parents will like you
no matter what you wear.

348
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:28,642
Really?

349
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:29,522
Of course.

350
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:32,922
Should I get something for them?

351
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,442
What do your parents like to eat?

352
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,122
My dad always says
my mom should take some chill pills.

353
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,522
What if your mom doesn't like me?

354
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:54,802
What's wrong?

355
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,922
Why are you scared like this?

356
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:56,922
This doesn't feel like you.

357
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:58,562
I'm not scared.

358
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:00,042
Not scared?

359
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:00,682
No.

360
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,042
Let's go.

361
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:02,922
Let's go.

362
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:14,042
The bag.

363
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:14,922
Give it to me.

364
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:28,682
We're not there yet?

365
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:29,642
Almost.

366
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:30,882
Just ahead.

367
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:32,522
We're almost there?

368
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:33,402
Almost there.

369
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:38,922
I've got things to do today.

370
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:39,882
I'll come another time.

371
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,002
Don't.

372
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,922
Don't. We're here.

373
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,162
Let's go.

374
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:51,402
Yingjun,

375
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:54,162
how about I come some other day?

376
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:55,522
We're right in front of my house.

377
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:58,162
I'm suddenly feeling
a bit of a stomachache.

378
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,802
My mom is inside waiting for you.

379
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:00,442
Waiting.

380
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:02,042
I mean

381
00:20:02,282 --> 00:20:04,242
when the weather is better,
we'll come again.

382
00:20:04,522 --> 00:20:05,042
You.

383
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,002
It is quite good today.

384
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,402
Come.

385
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:22,042
Let's go.

386
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:04,922
Welcome my son's girlfriend home.

387
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,802
Mom, cut it out.

388
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:10,282
What a pretty girl.

389
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,562
Let me take a look.

390
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:15,282
Welcome Yaoyao to my home.

391
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:16,122
No.

392
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:17,802
Our home.

393
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,162
We'll be one family from now on.

394
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:20,802
Welcome.

395
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:21,522
Come, Dudu.

396
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:22,402
Shake hands.

397
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:23,882
- What are you doing?
- Shake hands.

398
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,402
Yaoyao, come upstairs with me.

399
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:26,162
Alright.

400
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:26,762
Go.

401
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:29,162
Dad.

402
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,042
Mom is too dramatic.

403
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:32,522
She's always like this.

404
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:38,922
You're really pretty.

405
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:41,242
Such a lovely girl.

406
00:21:43,562 --> 00:21:44,282
Yaoyao.

407
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:48,162
Can you put the dog down?

408
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:49,642
Come on.

409
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,922
I can't hold a real dog

410
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:52,042
and even a fake one?

411
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,802
Don't let Mengyao laugh at you.

412
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:55,562
No, it's very cute.

413
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:57,562
You are both very cute.

414
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:00,282
Yaoyao,

415
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:02,162
how old are you?

416
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,282
What are you doing?

417
00:22:05,442 --> 00:22:07,282
Asking a girl's age right away?

418
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,522
How rude.

419
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:10,162
Haven't you heard the saying

420
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:12,522
that women are young girls
even they die?

421
00:22:13,322 --> 00:22:14,322
You understand now.

422
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:15,322
Outdated.

423
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:17,162
Who's being rude?

424
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:18,522
Aren't you too?

425
00:22:18,522 --> 00:22:20,802
Look at how you've decorated this house.

426
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,522
It's so empty.

427
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:23,522
Saying I'm outdated.

428
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:24,762
This is outdated?

429
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:26,002
You are outdated.

430
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:27,282
Am I outdated?

431
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:29,162
Yaoyao, you know it, right?

432
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:31,442
This is called the minimalist style.

433
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,642
Simple but not simplistic.

434
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,282
She doesn't know it.

435
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:35,802
Minimalist.

436
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,402
I don't know it?

437
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:38,322
Mrs. Hu, you know it.

438
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:39,562
- He says I don't know.
- Enough.

439
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:40,442
Mom, Dad,

440
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:42,282
let's stop it.

441
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:43,322
You know it.

442
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:48,002
Yaoyao, I heard from Yingjun

443
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:49,922
that you studied in France.

444
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:50,642
Yes, Mrs. Hu.

445
00:22:50,642 --> 00:22:52,522
I stayed in Paris for a while.

446
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:55,002
I love Paris so much.

447
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:55,642
Really.

448
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:58,162
It's both romantic and free.

449
00:22:58,642 --> 00:22:59,682
Free.

450
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,322
She was free to spend money.

451
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:02,922
Staying in those malls.

452
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:04,042
You can't even drag her out.

453
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:06,562
It's really tempting there.

454
00:23:06,882 --> 00:23:08,042
Yaoyao, you know, right?

455
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:10,162
Mrs. Hu,

456
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:12,802
actually, I usually went to flea markets

457
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:14,802
or second-hand markets.

458
00:23:15,282 --> 00:23:16,522
I didn't go much...

459
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,922
Flea markets are good.

460
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,322
Hu Yingjun, look at Yaoyao.

461
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,802
Focusing on her studies.

462
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,522
Unlike you, always wasting money.

463
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,122
- Exactly
- So good.

464
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:30,442
Yaoyao, actually,
I love going to flea markets too.

465
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,242
Really?

466
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,442
Do you know what a flea market is?

467
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:34,562
And you also love to go?

468
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:35,922
Of course, I know.

469
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:38,042
Flea markets

470
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,562
are second-hand markets.

471
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:40,802
Antiques and stuff.

472
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:42,522
Stop it.

473
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:45,282
Yaoyao, what were you studying

474
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:46,642
during your school time?

475
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,162
I studied art design.

476
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:50,042
Mom, Yaoyao is great at drawing.

477
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,802
She does all the character drawings
in our company.

478
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:52,802
- Don't ask so much.
- Really?

479
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:55,402
Yaoyao, would you like to draw a picture

480
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:56,402
for me during your spare time?

481
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:57,802
Sure, no problem.

482
00:23:57,802 --> 00:24:00,122
Draw what?

483
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,922
The smile of Isabella?

484
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:05,042
Why are you asking so many questions?

485
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:05,922
It's her first visit.

486
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:06,682
Right, Yaoyao?

487
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:08,282
Are you done?

488
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,122
What do you mean?

489
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,402
Did I say something wrong?

490
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:12,802
Yaoyao, am I right?

491
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:13,282
Yes...

492
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:13,922
Ignore him.

493
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:14,642
- Or no?
- Yaoyao,

494
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:15,562
let me tell you.

495
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:17,002
When Yingjun was young,

496
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:19,122
I occasionally let him babysit
for a couple of days,

497
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:20,682
and he even bumped his head.

498
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:22,522
Let me tell you.

499
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:23,522
The reason you're stupid now

500
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:24,922
is directly related to him.

501
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:26,522
Mom, you two are arguing,

502
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:27,922
but don't involve innocent people.

503
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:29,442
Yeah, why are you bringing up old stuff?

504
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:30,322
What do you mean?

505
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:31,242
Don't listen to them.

506
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:32,282
That's how it was.

507
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:33,682
Didn't you let the kid bump his head?

508
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,002
That's just the way you are.

509
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:35,522
Don't listen.

510
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:36,922
- I'm not wrong.
- You're just like that.

511
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:37,642
Too many questions.

512
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,522
Shut up.

513
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:39,162
Play with your dog.

514
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:40,202
Even a dog is better than you.

515
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:42,522
The youngest child here

516
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,762
is about five or six years old.

517
00:24:44,002 --> 00:24:45,882
There are also children
at seven or eight.

518
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:04,402
Here you are.

519
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:05,802
Thank you.

520
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:33,922
Look over there.

521
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:35,922
Go take a look.

522
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:39,642
Okay, please come this way.

523
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:43,282
Great.

524
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,562
My worry was unnecessary.

525
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:36,162
Well then,

526
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:38,002
I'd like to say a few words first.

527
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:42,922
First of all,

528
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:47,802
welcome to our residence,
Miss Bai Mengyao.

529
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:50,922
He's a social businessman.

530
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:52,122
You'll get used to it.

531
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:55,642
I used to think Hu Yingjun

532
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:58,402
was just an unreliable silly boy.

533
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:00,002
Unexpectedly,

534
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:03,442
your little team has done quite well.

535
00:27:04,762 --> 00:27:07,522
Yaoyao, you've been a great help.

536
00:27:08,922 --> 00:27:11,282
When he asked me for money back then,

537
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:13,322
I really thought he was just going

538
00:27:13,322 --> 00:27:14,762
to mess around like before.

539
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:15,922
But to my surprise,

540
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:18,042
he actually paid me back the rent.

541
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:20,802
It seems you young people

542
00:27:20,802 --> 00:27:22,322
are really getting better and better.

543
00:27:23,002 --> 00:27:24,322
Mrs. Hu, don't worry.

544
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,282
We'll all work hard together.

545
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:27,522
And we'll keep each other in check.

546
00:27:29,802 --> 00:27:31,282
Dad, you sit.

547
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:32,802
Right.

548
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:33,442
Sit down.

549
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:34,402
I'm used to it.

550
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:38,042
Dad, Mom,

551
00:27:38,882 --> 00:27:40,802
you always think I'm unreliable.

552
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:43,402
Yes, everything I have now

553
00:27:43,402 --> 00:27:44,522
is given by you.

554
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:46,002
Do you know

555
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:49,002
why I still insisted
on starting a business

556
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:50,762
despite being cheated and failing a lot?

557
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,042
Because I wanted to prove myself.

558
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:57,642
I wanted to prove

559
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,922
I could accomplish something.

560
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:00,642
Look,

561
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,922
now An Ran and I
are running this company well,

562
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:03,522
right?

563
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:08,402
And Miss Bai Mengyao has also joined us.

564
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:10,922
So we will certainly
do better and better.

565
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:11,922
You can rest assured.

566
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:13,042
Okay.

567
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:14,522
If that's the case,

568
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:17,162
you two make
your own decisions in the future.

569
00:28:17,202 --> 00:28:18,722
For us parents,

570
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:21,122
we can only help you get started.

571
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,642
The rest of the journey is up to you.

572
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:25,402
I wish you better and better
in the future.

573
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:26,522
Cheers.

574
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:28,042
Cheers.

575
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,042
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Hu.

576
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,162
Come on.

577
00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:31,642
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Hu.

578
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:32,522
Naughty boy.

579
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:33,282
What are you saying?

580
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,042
Yaoyao, help yourself.

581
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:38,002
I will, Mr. Hu.

582
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:39,042
Make yourself comfortable.

583
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:39,562
Come on, good.

584
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:40,802
Make yourself at home.

585
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:43,442
Thank you, Mrs. Hu.

586
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,402
How is it? Did you learn something new?

587
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:52,442
We've learned a lot.

588
00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:53,242
Thank you.

589
00:28:53,562 --> 00:28:55,322
Then have a look around.

590
00:28:55,322 --> 00:28:55,922
You go ahead.

591
00:28:55,922 --> 00:28:56,402
Okay.

592
00:29:08,402 --> 00:29:09,562
He's listening to Bluebird.

593
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,242
He doesn't understand anything.

594
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:20,682
Little one,

595
00:29:20,682 --> 00:29:22,562
do you like listening to this animation?

596
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:27,802
Then can we

597
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:29,802
sit down and listen with you?

598
00:29:38,282 --> 00:29:39,402
May I ask you

599
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:42,802
what the Bluebird looks like?

600
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,882
I haven't seen it.

601
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,122
What about you?

602
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:49,642
I have heard of it.

603
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:51,762
In ancient China,

604
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:53,882
there is a book called
the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

605
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:57,402
In the book, it says
the Bluebird has colorful feathers

606
00:29:58,042 --> 00:29:59,522
and pitch-black eyes

607
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:01,562
and is the messenger
of the Queen Mother of Heaven.

608
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:03,882
It must be very beautiful.

609
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:09,442
But what exactly is "beautiful"?

610
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:15,642
There are many kinds of beauty.

611
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:18,282
Beautiful when smiling,

612
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:20,322
beautiful when crying,

613
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:22,322
delicate beauty

614
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:23,922
and sloppy beauty.

615
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:25,762
And someone

616
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:27,802
as cute as you is beautiful too.

617
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:32,802
Are you a couple?

618
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:35,162
How smart you are!

619
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:35,922
Yes.

620
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,442
Is your girlfriend beautiful?

621
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:42,922
Yes, she is very beautiful.

622
00:30:43,162 --> 00:30:44,042
What about you, sir?

623
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:46,442
He looks ordinary.

624
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:49,522
I don't believe it.

625
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:52,442
His voice sounds so nice.

626
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:55,242
Really, really ordinary.

627
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:58,802
May I touch your face, sir?

628
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,442
Of course you can.

629
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:10,522
These are the eyes, this is the nose,

630
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:11,522
and this is the mouth.

631
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:14,282
Is he very ordinary?

632
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:15,442
You're lying.

633
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:17,682
He is clearly very cute,

634
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:19,642
as cute as me.

635
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:22,562
I just love such honest children.

636
00:31:23,402 --> 00:31:25,442
My fault. I was wrong.

637
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,882
You adults are really strange.

638
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:30,562
You adults are really strange.

639
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:34,242
So are you going to get married?

640
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:40,002
We haven't decided yet.

641
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:46,882
I'll tell you another story
about the Bluebird,

642
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:47,442
okay?

643
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,522
Once upon a time,
there was a deeply in love couple.

644
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,882
Because of some special reasons,

645
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:55,802
they were separated.

646
00:31:56,522 --> 00:31:59,162
They hoped they could convey
their longing for each other

647
00:31:59,162 --> 00:32:01,042
through the legendary Bluebird.

648
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:08,442
So are you going to get married?

649
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:29,362
(Proposal.)

650
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,562
(What kind would An Ran like?)

651
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,602
The first one is the romantic type.

652
00:32:34,922 --> 00:32:35,842
Rent a large yacht,

653
00:32:35,842 --> 00:32:37,442
and then the two of you on the deck

654
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:39,602
hold hands as the sun sets.

655
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:45,602
The next is the low-key luxury type.

656
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:46,522
You suddenly appear

657
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:48,322
and whip out a big diamond ring.

658
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:49,802
Stun her with a big diamond ring.

659
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,042
Finally, the cheesy humor type.

660
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,402
Why do boys like to ask girls out

661
00:32:52,842 --> 00:32:54,802
to visit haunted houses
or watch horror movies?

662
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:57,162
In such a scary atmosphere,

663
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:58,002
you will just swoop in

664
00:32:58,002 --> 00:32:59,042
like this

665
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:00,362
and hold her tightly.

666
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:02,602
It's okay. I'm here.

667
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:07,002
What do you think? Which one?

668
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:33,362
What are you doing?

669
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:36,082
Let's get married.

670
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:48,082
Marry me.

671
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,082

was all cured by my marriage.

Cons.

704
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,282
Marriage is a shackle.

705
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:50,162
