Chairman.

21
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,130
How many times have I told you

22
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,200
that you can call me "Dad" in private?

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,490
Dad, what brought you here?

24
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,370
If I hadn't come, did you plan on waiting until New Way

25
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,290
declared bankruptcy before telling me?

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,050
That's not what I meant.

27
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,020
I will take care of it.

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,710
You will take care of it?

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,600
So many years have passed in the blink of an eye, but how come you still do things

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,480
the same way you did when you were eight years old?

31

<i>Have you seen my transformer?</i>

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,200
<i>What are you hiding?</i>

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,940
<i>- Nothing! 
 - Let me see.</i>

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,650
<i>Isn't it just a stupid spinning top? What are you hiding it for?</i>

36
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,260
<i>Just putting on an act.</i>

37
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,850
<i>I'm warning you, you must not tell Mom and Dad!</i>

38
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,990
<i>Otherwise, I won't let you off.</i>

39
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,550
<i>Eat some more meat.</i>

Every time you encounter any difficulties,

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,940
you never asked anyone for help.

43
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,500
You didn't need your dad's help.

44
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,590
Ling Yue, I...

45
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,400
indeed owe you a lot.

46
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,410
However, you need to give me a chance to make it up to you.

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,380
Dad, I am no longer the person I was when I was eight.

48
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,980
I can now solve my own problems whenever I face any.

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,990
Okay.

50
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,240
We are one family after all.

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,400
The purpose of family is to care for and rely on one another.

52
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,880
After you think this through, you can come and find me then.

53
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,330
Here it is.

54
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,290
It was just perfectly the last dish.

55
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,960
Is the sun rising from the west now?

56
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,990
All these years, it's always been me who cooked for you.

57
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,220
Today, you personally made food and invited me to eat.

58
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,230
Aren't I helping you properly experience

59
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,420
what it means to be a genius chef?

60
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,420
Amazing.

61
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,190
What's this?

62
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,560
<i>[Take-out Receipt 
 Total: ¥96.10]</i>

63
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,560
Scrap paper, that's all!

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,780
I knew it. My sister's still my sister.

65
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,920
She didn't suddenly turn into some Lady River Snail. 
 <i>(T/N: Legend has it there was once a river snail spirit who was saved by a man named Xie Duan. To show her thanks, she cooked and cleaned for him every day when he was out of the house.)</i>

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,420
This time, I really went all out to prepare all of these dishes for you.

67
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,240
I wanted you to properly replenish your nutrients.

68
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,150
Eat this. I made this one.

69
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,160
This one's so good! You only made this one tiny dish?

70
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,740
So stingy. Don't fight me for it. You eat the pig trotters.

71
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,410
Okay.

72
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,940
Do you... have something you want to talk to me about?

73
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,980
No.

74
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,700
What would I have to talk about?

75
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,750
President Ling, please consider

76
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,680
the proposal we made. I look forward to our collaboration.

77
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,480
I understand. Thank you.

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,540
President Ling, Japan's requirements this time are too strict.

79
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,680
If you follow their plan,

80
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,460
we will lose everything and there will be no benefit to speak of.

81
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,980
It's like looting a burning house. If they didn't do it now, then what would they be waiting for?

82
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,580
Then, what do you plan to do?

83
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,330
I haven't decided yet.

84
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,570
It's the first time I've heard you say something like that.

85
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,840
Anxin often says, "If there's really no solution,

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
don't stress yourself out too much.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,340
Clear all the thoughts from your mind

88
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,880
and new surprises might appear."

89
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,940
I'm going to walk around downstairs.

90
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,850
Okay. Then I will wait for you inside the company. Order me whenever you need me.

91
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,700
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

92
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,420
I want one hot Americano, please.

93
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,990
Americano, right? One second, please.

94
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,980
Young man! Sheng Ju Lan's holding an event right now! Why don't you bring a set back for your girlfriend?

95
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,200
No need.

96
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,480
It's really very easy to use!

97
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,260
The only reason my facial skin is so smooth is all because I used Sheng Ju Lan's facial cleanser.

98
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,770
You can use ¥300 to purchase the result of a ¥2,000 product.

99
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,270
It's very worth it.

100
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,430
You're welcome to come again.

101
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,780
<i>Wait! Don't move!</i>

102
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,390
<i>Why are you touching my things?</i>

103
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,960
<i>You've already used all of it. Why not throw it away?</i>

104
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,750
<i>Used all of it? Don't you see there's still so much inside?</i>

105
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,220
<i>There's a fingernail amount in there. Is it worth worrying this much about?</i>

106
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,590
<i>You really don't understand how expensive everyday life is.</i>

107
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,450
<i>This is both very easy to use and insanely hard to get.</i>

108
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,330
<i>Of course, I must use it sparingly. This tiny bit can last for a long time.</i>

109
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,860
<i>What's this brand? I've never even seen it before.</i>

110
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,750
<i>- You know PK II, right?</i> 
 - <i>Doesn't it say KAI?</i>

111
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,000
<i>This is a small English brand called KAI.</i>

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,950
<i>This is a cheaper replacement for PKII.</i>

113
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,440
<i>Those are all business advertising techniques. Do you really believe you can use ¥300 to buy something of ¥3,000 quality?</i>

114
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,020
<i>Of course, I believe it! This was something I did detailed research on and bought from overseas!</i>

115
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,060
<i>This is the winner among similarly priced products.</i>

116
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,970
<i>Overseas?</i>

117
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,740
<i>For us poor, balding girls, </i>

118
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,860
<i>how could I afford to buy PKII?</i>

119
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,990
<i>I can only search for cheaper makeup products to replace PKII.</i>

120
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,930
<i>They're... all similar anyways.</i>

121
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,870
Contact the marketing department. We're holding a meeting immediately.

122
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,590
President Ling, according to your orders,

123
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,980
we've already gathered many lower-priced replacement brands who have been competing against larger brands in the market for the past few years.

124
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,560
<i>- Greetings, President Ling.</i> 
 - Let's begin.

125
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,530
I need to establish collaborative relationships with all of those brands within an hour.

126
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,350
- The Publicity Department must be on standby to update the products list whenever needed. 
 - Understood.

127
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,950
All right. Connect them.

128
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,150
Hello, Mr. Ling. It's my pleasure to cooperate with New Way.

129
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,980
Chairman Gu, is the shopping celebration you are hosting this time targeted towards New Way?

130
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,530
We've been planning this celebration for a long time.

131
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,560
We've just never publicized this.

132
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,530
Our Gu Group's primary focus for future expansion is in the e-commerce field,

133
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,880
and New Way is an up and rising business within e-commerce.

134
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,860
Therefore, the two companies having event similarities is completely normal.

135
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,960
There's no such thing as targeting.

136
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,350
But the rumors say the brands on your website

137
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,090
are all businesses who originally agreed to collaborate with New Way and got intercepted by you.

138
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,040
What response do you have to this?

139
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,320
Didn't you say so yourself? They're all rumors.

140
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,570
As everyone knows, no matter if it's

141
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,750
with respect to market impact or overall ability,

142
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,530
New Way cannot compete with our Gu Group.

143
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,990
This is clear to anyone with sense.

144
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,920
Also, when brands choose their collaboration partners,

145
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,440
it's hard to avoid having instances of consulting with many different businesses.

146
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,330
Then, the good bird will choose its own perch. 
 <i>(T/N: In this context, it means the intelligent businessmen will choose the best collaboration partner)</i>

147
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,330
This is the rule of business.

148
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,080
How can that count as interception?

149
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,970
In the future, don't let this reporter inside.

150
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,530
Got it, Dad.

151
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,510
Chairman Gu, what's your opinion on New Way's packet loss incident?

152
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,390
This matter does not have enough evidence to prove

153
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,780
that New Way's technology has erred. Please report this in a reasonable manner, reporters.

154
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,170
Stop talking! During such a situation,

155
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,870
- you're still helping him smooth things over? 
 - Dad.

156
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,960
Of course. Young people

157
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,130
will make amateur mistakes in order to earn a quick profit.

158
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,170
It's hard to avoid. This is something

159
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,770
that is inappropriate for us to make judgments on.

160
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,430
But right now, people on the internet claim the packet loss incident was a result of Gu Group's ill-intentioned sensationalization.

161
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,800
Do you have anything to say about this?

162
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,000
A load of nonsense!

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,550
I, Gu Yuanchao, have been active in the market for many decades.

164
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,350
I've always been honest and trustworthy.

165
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,170
Would I do something like that?

166
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,530
New Way has already revealed a video.

167
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,550
Apparently, this matter was caused by a member of your Gu Group.

168
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,520
Let's go! New Way's accepting interviews!

169
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,470
What's going on? You still didn't deal with it completely!

170
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,460
Chairman, that's impossible.

171
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,080
Dad.

172
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,990
I'm sorry, Chairman.

173
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,630
We're being controlled by that brat!

174
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,240
Next, I...

175
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,820
don't know what card he'll play.

176
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,080
- What's wrong? 
 - Are you all right?

177
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,450
- Dad, what's wrong? 
 - Are you okay?

178
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,150
- Go pour me a glass of water. 
 - Okay.

179
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,990
<i>[Strategic Contract Agreement]</i>

My pleasure.

194
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,250
It was stated that the brands cooperating with New Way have now gone to Gu Group.

195
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,540
The brands that you announced a collaboration with are all mid-tier.

196
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,220
It's inconsistent with the luxury brands that Ling Group announced a collaboration with in the past.

197
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,650
Was this a result of suffering a heavy blow from the Gu Group?

198
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,730
No one can influence New Way's policy decisions.

199
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,570
This selection was based completely on the current consumer trends.

200
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,930
Expanding to small-town and rural markets is a very important strategy that New Way will focus on in the future.

201
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,420
Do you have any comments on the video that the official blog posted, which showed the truth of Cai Niao Posting Station's packet loss incident?

202
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,260
Did the official blog report this under your authorization?

203
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,380
Who it was that used the trust of netizens and consumers

204
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,190
to create disorder in the market for personal gain

205
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,020
will be brought to light soon.

206
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,340
Since everyone has asked,

207
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,440
I might as well announce New Way's collaboration project plan with the Ministry of Public Security.

208
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,540
In order to better serve New Way's customers,

209
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,740
the couriers under New Way will receive upgraded monitoring systems

210
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,460
that will be connected to the district's monitoring system network

211
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,380
to provide a safe and free monitoring system for everyone.

212
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,780
Was the reason you chose to publicize the video implied to be about the Gu Group today

213
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,630
in order to suppress its celebration event?

214
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,720
Yes, you understand very well.

215
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,050
However, it can't be considered anything like suppression. I just wanted to return the truth to everyone.

216
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,960
Will New Way still collaborate with Gu Group?

217
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,460
Do you have any other news at hand? Please answer.

218
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,380

219
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,160

<i>Please answer!</i>

224
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,890
Is the publicity material for the Anniversary Celebration ready?

225
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,600
Yes, it has been prepared.

226
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,120
Brother Yue.

227
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,110
Why are you looking for me?

228
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,700
I'm not some kind of harmful weapon.

229
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,280
You don't have to hide from me every time you see me, do you?

230
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,380
I just want to avoid unnecessary trouble.

231
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,360
I apologize for the problem between you and my dad.

232
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,410
The one that should be apologizing isn't you.

233
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,020
We know there's no problem with the posting station itself.

234
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,760
There are no technical loopholes at all.

235
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,550
The one that should be apologizing is the person behind all of this who harbors malicious intent.

236
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,010
I know that my dad did wrong here.

237
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,740
Can you spare the Gu Group this time?

238
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,390
Sorry, judging from the time,

239
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,310
the subpoena from the court should have already reached Chairman Gu's hands.

240
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,930
Subpoena?

241
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,970
Brother Yue, do you really have to go as far as this step?

242
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,050
This should be something you should be asking Chairman Gu, Miss Gu.

243
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,890
I am sorry about disturbing you today.

244
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,490
Have the legal department ready to follow up at any moment.

245
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,010
Okay.

246
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,350
<i>With regards to Gu Group's malicious slander against New Way</i>

247
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,110
<i>that resulted in the loss of its reputation,</i>

248
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,170
<i>New Way has already filed an appeal</i>

249
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,500
<i>to demand a public apology from Gu Group as well as related compensation.</i>

250
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,080
<i>Surprisingly, the compensation that New Way is demanding</i>

251
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,200
<i>is just ¥1.</i>

252
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,560
How is Miss Gu?

253
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,610
Ever since the situation got exposed, Miss Gu has been staying at home.

254
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,090
I heard that Miss Gu personally went to beg President Ling Yue for mercy.

255
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,110
However, President Ling Yue has not changed his mind.

256
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,180
I assume Miss Gu isn't feeling so well now.

257
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,770
How can Second Brother be like that?

258
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,690
Director Ling, where are you going? Right now, the Gu family is being surrounded by reporters.

259
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,720
If you go now, you're throwing yourself in harm's way!

260
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,540
I don't care.

261
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,310

 - Yes.<i></i>

265

First come, first serve, you know that? Go line up at the back.

266
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,380
Okay.

267
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,250
What?<i></i>

268
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,520
Bro, why are there so many people blockading this area?

269
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,840
Of course, they are waiting for Gu Yuanchao's newest apology statement.

270
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,820
This well-established company is apologizing to an up-and-coming company.

271
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,770
This must be huge news.

272
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,020
Also, the Gu family has a daughter who's an internet celebrity.

273
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,590
The netizens have been keeping track of her social media movements.

274
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,270
After all, she has something going on with New Way, right?

275
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,080
No way.

276
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,380
Don't tell me you didn't even know about this?

277
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,840
Let me tell you!  If you work in this field, you need to be very alert.

278
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,300
You need to follow these small kinds of gossip very closely, understand?

279
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,500
All right, you go play aside. If you want to learn, go find your master.

280
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,160
Who was it?

281
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,850
- Did you see who it was? 
 - No.

282
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,010
Xin'er?

283
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,640
Why are you here?

284
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,250
I came to pick you up.

285
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,250
Come here. Be careful.

286
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,980
I'm sorry that you had to see this.

287
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,770
Relax, I'll definitely...

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,050
But when we were little, you would only climb walls to skip class.

289
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,620
What happened today? You're dressed so beautifully.

290
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,640
When did I...

291
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,660
<i>Sister Xin'er!</i>

292
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,020
<i>Lower your voice. People will come at the sound of your voice!</i>

293
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,850
<i>Just pretend you didn't see what happened today. Understood?</i>

294
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,580
<i>Or else, I will...</i>

295
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,490
<i>I will make you regret it.</i>

296
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,080
<i>- Why are you here? 
 - I'm waiting for my brother and the others to be done with class.</i>

297
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,330
<i>Fine, then you wait. I'll be going first.</i>

298
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,200
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

299
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,870
You still remember such a trivial thing?

300
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,470
To me, what situation of yours is a trivial thing?

301
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,380
I just wanted to find a place

302
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,360
where I could have peace and quiet.

303
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,440
But at a time like this, isn't it better to stay at home and avoid things?

304
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Are you coming or not? If not, I'm leaving.

305
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,110
My princess, this way.

306
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,770
<i>With regards to Gu Group's malicious slander against New Way</i>

307

308
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,650
<i>Seriously. I didn't see this coming.</i>

309
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,750
<i>Gu Group went too far.</i>

310
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,390
<i>This has really taken a new turn.</i>

311
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,710
<i>I heard Gu Xin'er's family had a problem</i>

312
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,760
<i>and publicly admitted that they ruined New Way's reputation.</i>

313
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,070
I know. Her dad is so cruel.

314
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,620
He really brought his daughter's specialized business a huge setback.

315
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,430
The main point is that New Way's president is also mean. He actually asked for ¥1 in compensation!

316
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,020
<i>New Way's president is too awful. He's obviously humiliating him.</i>

317
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,530
<i>KAI is having a sale tonight at New Way.</i>

318
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,360
<i>- They are selling KAI in China, too? 
 - Yes, KAI is having a sale. Place your order now.</i>

319
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,290
<i>But I haven't planned my strategy yet.</i>

320
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,320
<i>Quick, let me see your shopping cart.</i>

321
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,110
<i>[New Way and KAI's joint sponsor]</i>

322
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,540
What are you looking at? You've been ignoring me.

323
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,950
Don't distract me. I'm busy adding things to my shopping cart.

324
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,310
So awesome! Just within three short minutes,

325
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,900
sales have reached over one million!

326
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,130
Where's President Ling? I have to tell him this good news!

327
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,530
President Ling already left long ago.

328
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,970
I'm guessing he already knew we would win by a landslide.

329
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,960
In fact, your boss is indeed your boss!

330
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,940
President Ling.

331
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,040
What's up?

332
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,630
Miss Anxin has gone missing.

333
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,910
Missing? Have you checked her home?

334
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,690
I've checked everywhere.

335
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,900
Move aside! Move aside!

336
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,670
President Ling, can I interview you?

337
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,410
- President Ling. 
 - Gu Ansheng!

338
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,490
Gu Ansheng, are you in there?

339
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,560
Mrs. Gu came out. Take a photo, quick!

340
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,110
Young Master Ling, are you here to show off?

341
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,420
Auntie, I'm here to look for Gu Ansheng.

342
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,410
He's not here.

343
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,710
Don't come here again.

344
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,870
The Gu family doesn't welcome you.

345
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,550
Where's Anxin? Do you know where she went?

346
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,380
I am asking you about Anxin.

347
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,980
Do you think...

348
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,330
I will give you another chance to hurt her?

349
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,280
What drunken words are you saying?

350
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,370
Don't you get it?

351
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,680
Anxin left because you forced her to!

352
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,380
You...

353
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,320
forced her to leave.

354
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,780
<i>Do you have something to tell me?</i>

355
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,670
<i>No.</i>

356
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,090
<i>What would I have to say?</i>

357
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,830
<i>You booked D7190 to Clear River Town.</i>

358
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,730
<i>You are leaving.</i>

359
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,060
<i>Is it because of Ling Yue?</i>

360
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,840
<i>I...</i>

361
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,430
<i>My encounter with him</i>

362
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,840
<i>was purely coincidental.</i>

363
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,280
<i>Be honest and tell me.</i>

364
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,220
<i>You are not a wanted criminal from the mafia</i>

365
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,860
<i>who broke the law and are now hiding in my home out of fear of being discovered by others?</i>

366
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,910
<i>I won't chase you out again. Did you hear me?</i>

367
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,640
<i>I heard you.</i>

368
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,680
<i>At first, I thought,</i>

369
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,280
<i>if he stayed by my side forever, I would be quite happy.</i>

370
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,960
<i>Until that day when he showed up at the birthday celebration</i>

371
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,080
<i>and appeared in front of me.</i>

372
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,580
<i>Let me formally introduce myself. I'm Ling Yue.</i>

373
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,230
<i>At that moment, I realized</i>

374
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,170
<i>we were living in two completely different worlds.</i>

375
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,640
<i>He wouldn't be unable to find a meal because he was a beggar,</i>

376
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,280
<i>and he didn't have to worry about the performance-price ratio of pesticides.</i>

377
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,370
<i>He also wasn't the Xiao Ba that belonged only to me.</i>

378
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,820
<i>If it weren't for that accident,</i>

379
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,820
<i>we wouldn't have ever had any interaction.</i>

380
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,370
<i>Now, he is in trouble.</i>

381
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,250
<i>Can you use your feelings alone to help him?</i>

382
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,300
<i>Your love, to him,</i>

383
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,560
<i> is a kind of burden.</i>

384
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,910
<i>The things Xin'er said may have been true.</i>

385
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:05,100
<i>Perhaps, I'm a burden to him.</i>

386
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,150
<i>Hence, I want to leave here for the time being.</i>

387
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,750
<i>Perhaps, it's time for me to let go.</i>

388
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,740
<i>Anxin.</i>

<i>- Hi, Youyou. 
 - Hello, Anxin.</i>

<i>It states that New Way is in a crisis now.</i>

392
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,630
<i>Ling Yue was hospitalized for overworking.</i>

393
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,090
<i>Didn't you receive any information?</i>

394
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,120
<i>I got it.</i>

395
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,030
<i>Hello. The cellphone that you are calling has been switched off.</i>

396
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,360
<i>Brother, Ling Yue seems to be unwell and has been hospitalized.</i>

397
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,910
<i>I'm going to visit him. I'm leaving.</i>

398
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,690
<i>So you don't care how many times this guy has hurt you.</i>

399
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,150
<i>As long as he needs you, you will drop everything and run to him?</i>

400
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,470
<i>It's not that, Brother.</i>

401
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,500
<i>Then have you ever thought that</i>

402
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,380
<i>I need you, too?</i>

403
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,490
<i>I know that I have always been an older brother to you.</i>

404
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,210
<i>However, this word "older brother" is too heavy and I can't breathe.</i>

406
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,000
<i>I can feel lost, I can be afraid, and I can hurt, too.</i>

407
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,300
<i>But as long as I know you are behind me,</i>

408
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,550
<i>as long as I know that you still need me,</i>

409
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,780
<i>I can do anything.</i>

410
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,010

<i>This comes as instinct for me.</i>

413
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,360
<i>But now, I can only watch you</i>

If it weren't for you,

462
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,630
she wouldn't have left.

463
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,970
<i>Ling Yue!</i>

464
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,230
<i>What's wrong? Can't bear to leave me?</i>

465
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,580
<i>I forgot something.</i>

466
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,810
<i>What?</i>

467
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,210
<i>Send me your Alipay account number.</i>

468
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,120
<i>Isn't continuously owing me a good thing?</i>

469
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,770
<i>Just send it to me. I will pay you back gradually.</i>

470
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,990
<i>[¥82,000 transfer from Anxin]</i>

471
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,600
<i>Ling Yue, I heard others say that when this Ferris wheel is at its highest point,</i>

472
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,000
<i>the wishes you make will definitely come true. Let's make a wish.</i>

473
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,800
<i>This is just a lie for kids.</i>

474
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,000
<i>Idiot, you should listen to your girlfriend at this time.</i>

475
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,400
<i>Fine.</i>

476
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,200
<i>I wish that Anxin will always be healthy and happy.</i>

477
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,000
<i>Without a care in the world.</i>

478
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,400
<i>I hope she will always persist in the job she is passionate about,</i>

479
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,000
<i>and I hope I can protect her forever so she doesn't get hurt.</i>

480
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,200
<i>I hope we can hold hands and slowly walk through the long four seasons</i>

481
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,600
<i>and never separate for the rest of our lifetimes.</i>

482
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,400
Any news about her?

483
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,600
My apologies, President Ling. There are still none.

484
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,400
Drink some.

485
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,100
We haven't found her, right?

486
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,000
If you don't eat or drink, by the time we find her, you will have starved and died of illness.

487
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,400
Wouldn't Anxin be sad and upset?

488
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,900
That's right! By taking your meals regularly and sleeping regularly,

489
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,200
you can live to wait for Anxin's return.
