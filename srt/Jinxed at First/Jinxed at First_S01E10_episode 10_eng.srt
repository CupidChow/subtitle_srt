00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,300
 Seul Bi, hang in there a bit longer. A little longer.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,620
You're here, madams!

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,810
Okay, follow me.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,990
Who are you to order us to come and go?

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,940
Okay, please come in.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,380
- Come straight in. 
 - Hey, hey.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,800
Please come in. Come in. Come in!

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,440
Come this way. This way.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,610
What's going on?

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,690
- CEO? 
 - Come in!

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,080
Is everyone here?

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,040
Okay.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,620
Starting today, this is the newly inaugurated Geoseong Private Loans CEO,

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,090
Mr. Wang—

18
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,870
I mean, CEO Wang Yoon Ho.

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,870
Okay, clap!

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,560
Okay.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,520
Since I've taken responsibility for Geoseong Private Loans,

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,000
I just have one favor to ask you.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,310
Favor, my foot.

24
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,070
We're people working in the third financial sector, but

25
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,480
let's treat our customers

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,520
with a heart that's as abundant in generosity

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,750
as the first financial sector.

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,920
One more time, a round of applause!

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,100
Please clap!

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,830
Aigoo! Do it more softly.

31
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,920
So noisy!

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,350
Aigoo, why are you banging that stick so loudly?

33
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,310
There's a good reason for it.

34
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,510
Everyone's here, right?

35
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,830
Listen to me carefully.

36
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,140
Over the Seodong Market remodeling project, the developer was going to

37
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,330
con us in a weird and strange way,

38
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,050
but our Su Gwang resolved it in one go!

39
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,510
Everyone, clap!

40
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,070
My brother-in-law is the best!

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,220
How reassuring is it to have someone like him in the market?

42
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,790
That's right. Thank you!

43
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,150
Su Gwang, your face is emitting a radiance today.

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,380
There's no need for all of you to do this.

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,410
Hey, what are you saying?

46
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,670
Mr. Park, you've been going around yelling Su Gwang's name,

47
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,300
and you've finally resolved something big!

48
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,400
We were all about to be conned.

49
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,110
Exactly.

50
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,140
"Leave it to Su Gwang."

51
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,660
What Seul Bi said came true!

52
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,980
Right?

53
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,190
Why would you bring Seul Bi up right now, you party pooper?

54
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,100
Why are you so tactless?

55
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,450
Oh, well...

56
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,720
Anyway! In commemoration of Su Gwang saving our market,

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
dinner later at Bang's Chicken is on me!

58
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,550
Okay, then. Everyone, disband!

59
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,400
Disband or whatnot, you're so tactless.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,680
Aigoo. Aigoo, seriously.

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,590
Su Gwang.

62
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,840
Thank you so much for today.

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,300
- How are you so cool every day? 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

64
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,560
Hurry up and go in to prepare for the large group tonight. What's this?

65
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,400
- Why are you all dressed up when you're here to work? 
 - All right!

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,340
- Get inside! 
 - Su Gwang,

67
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,250
- I'll fry delicious chicken for you. 
 - Go in! Get inside!

68
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,870
Hyeon Tae, you're coming later, right?

69
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,110
Myeong Seong— I mean, Su Gwang!

70
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,110
Hyeong, why is it so noisy first thing in the morning?

71
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,730
- Is there a festival? 
 - Did the inauguration go well?

72
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,910
Congratulations.

73
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,960
It's all thanks to Miss Seul Bi.

74
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,690
Hey, if you pledge your loyalty to Miss Seul Bi, a day like this will come for you, too.

75
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,070
Gosh, I got it, Hyeongnim.

76
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,380
I'll look for an opportunity to approach the VIP soon.

77
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,600
We need to make sure he's not scheming something dangerous against Miss Seul Bi.

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,810
Be careful, Hyeong.

79
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,040
I'm leaving.

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
Goodbye.

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,210
Chairman, I received a call from the court to appear on the hearing date.

82
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,060
For what reason?

83
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,340
Min Joon used your psychiatric treatments as a reason

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,320
to apply for limited guardianship through the court.

85
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,190
Limited guardianship? 
  (TN: Limited Guardianship: The court designates a guardian to manage decisions for adults with illnesses or old age)

86
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,230
However, it hasn't been decided yet.

87
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,300
You're trying to bring me down

88
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,440
because of your obsession with that girl?

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,150
Father, you're not in your right mind right now.

90
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,040
You must focus on your treatment.

91
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,390
Prevent this from leaking out to the press

92
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,180
so that the shareholders aren't agitated by it.

93
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,750
Understood, Chairman.

94
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,170
Min Joon.

95
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,060
Haven't you thought about how the situation might turn out?

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,360
Your father's shock is great.

97
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,610
I'm worried that his health will decline at this rate.

98
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,340
It's something that needs to be addressed sooner or later.

99
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,950
If this rumor spreads,

100
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,480
the shareholders will immediately be agitated.

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,830
What on earth are you thinking?

102
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,120
Are you trying to take away your father's management rights?

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,390
Yes.

104
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,280
I am.

105
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,860
What's the next act that child will commit?

106
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,480
Will she do the same thing you did to my father?

107
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,360
Do you think this situation

108
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,490
was created by Seul Bi?

109
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,110
Then who else?

110
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,000
Since when has she been manipulating Min Joon?

111
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,740
What do you mean, manipulate?

112
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,280
You still know nothing about us.

113
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,640
We're all just mirrors that reflect you all.

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,010
Desire, hope,

115
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,400
ugliness, and even goodness.

116
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,960
A mirror that reflects everything within you.

117
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,480
Because you continue to be like this,

118
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,940
I keep wanting to try that thing called manipulation.

119
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,440
Holding another man in your heart

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,410
and manipulating my son...

121
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,280
In the end, you'll also get a taste of hell!

122
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,480
After you left this place,

123
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,150
I couldn't sleep.

124
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,480
Because for some reason,

125
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,890
I keep remembering that time from 20 years ago.

126
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,630
Twenty years ago...

127
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,170
I don't know what happened,

128
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,710
but that's not my fault.

129
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,020
Yes, sure. Sure, sure, sure.

130
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,550
Sure, sure.

131
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,970
That's right.

132
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,770
Now, what will...

133
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,880
What will happen to us now?

134
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,950
I'll prophesize

135
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,370
for you.

136
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,930
No.

137
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,840
No.

138
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,970
Now I know how pointless this all is.

139
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,540
Why did it take me this long to realize?

140
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,910
Twenty years ago...

141
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,830
if I had known then...

142
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,000
You already knew.

143
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,120
You already knew the future,

144
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,640
but you didn't want to change anything.

145
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,340
Apply for limited guardianship?

146
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,990
It's not like Sam Joong has dementia—

147
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,340
Yes.

148
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,500
Yes, I understand.

149
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,840
How humiliating for the family.

150
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,360
It's like they're telling the whole world

151
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,700
that mental illness runs in the family.

152
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,500
Must I hear this from a judge who's way across the river?

153
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,310
Min Joon applied for limited guardianship to bring Uncle down from his position?

154
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,800
What Sam Joong did to Father,

155
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,920
his son is doing the same thing to him.

156
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,800
Aren't Sam Joong's circumstances still better than Father's?

157
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,890
Wow, I never saw Seon Min Joon like that, but he's pretty hardcore.

158
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,310
- How cool. 
 - Cool?

159
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,520
So you're going to try it as well?

160
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,810
Well, just be careful not to get dementia.

161
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,790
That bastard.

162
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,700
Geumhwa will soon get noisy.

163
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,590
That punk Sam Joong's crisis is my opportunity.

164
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,530
Hey!

165
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,740
Su Gwang is now our market's man of good fortune!

166
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,640
That's right!

167
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,070
Even until my store's hanger collapsed,

168
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,190
I thought it was the return of the icon of misfortune, Go Myeong Seong.

169
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,170
But...

170
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,930
he's not.

171
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,510
He's not!

172
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,500
- He's not. 
 - Mrs. Smile. Mrs. Smile. Mrs. Smile.

173
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,650
I heard your husband got employed.

174
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,450
- That's great! Congratulations! 
 - Oh my, oh my.

175
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,370
It's a small company.

176
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,770
Congrats!

177
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,450
And...

178
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,920
I think Yeong Wu's going to have a sibling.

179
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,720
Oh my gosh!

180
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,170
- What in the world? 
 - Seriously!

181
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,710
I wonder if only good things will happen to our Seodong Market from now on.

182
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,120
Since we have our man of good fortune!

183
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,680
Okay! I can't sit still. Here!

184
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,400
 From now on, Su Gwang will become Seodong Market's man of good fortune.

185
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,050
 What are you saying all of the sudden?

186
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,830
 I'll make you that way.

187
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,790
 Into the man of good fortune.

188
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,630
Okay, let's give it up for the good fortune of Seodong Market!

189
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,950
Cheers!

190
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,750
Drink slowly. Slowly, slowly.

191
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,680
Mrs. Bang, you always only take care of Mr. Jeong.

192
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,200
Stop making up needless rumors.

193
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,030
I'll take care of you.

194
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,810
You don't even see me as a man?

195
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,130
Take care of me, too.

196
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,400
♫  Please notice me  ♫

197
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,990
♫  I'll smile a little more  ♫

198
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,880
♫  I'll look at you a little longer  ♫

199
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,420
♫  Please notice my feelings for you  ♫

200
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:25,030
♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please be with me  ♫

201
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,380
♫  If you hold my hand, I don't mind flying even higher  ♫

202
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,490
 Found it.

203
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,700
 Mom, I found it!

204
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,450
 - Really? 
 - Yeah.

205
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,490
 Our Su Gwang found everything?

206
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,600
 Where? Here?

207
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,550
 Over there.

208
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,800
 Wow! You did great!

209
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,880
 Mom, did you write this?

210
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,600
 I don't know.

211
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,940
 I don't know who wrote this,

212
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,000
 but they must really love this person.

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,480
 Love who?

214
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,780
 Our Su Gwang.

215
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,570
 Su Gwang, what will you do when you meet someone you love later?

216
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,180
 I'm only going to love you, Mom.

217
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,330
 Still, later on...

218
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,140
 If you meet someone you love later.

219
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,740
 Su Gwang,

220
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,860
 if you find someone you love, you must protect that person.

221
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,590
 I must protect her.

222
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,680
♫  Come closer  ♫

223
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,350
♫  I want you to hear the pounding sound of my heart  ♫

224
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,320
♫  I want you to catch the sound of my heart pounding faster  ♫

225
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,170
 - What were you doing? 
 - It's a secret.

226
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,010
 - What is it? 
 - It's a secret.

227
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,350
♫  I knew it was you  ♫

228
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,850
♫  It's alright to smile now  ♫

229
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,430
 Su Gwang,

230
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,900
 if you find someone you love, you must protect that person.

231
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,810
Where should I start my story?

232
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,390
This is my mother's mother...

233
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,010
and her mother's start of the story.

234
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,010
 Hidden from the world,

235
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,800
 we brought good fortune to our kings from generation to generation

236
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,980
 and lived as female shamans who prevented misfortune.

237
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,570
 Our abilities passed down from mother to daughter,

238
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,170
 and to her daughter.

239
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,600
 We were all born with blue stones clenched in our fists.

240
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,780
 The world had changed, but...

241
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,070
 what we had to do did not change.

242
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,930
 Those who coveted our abilities

243
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,560
 locked us away in secret places.

244
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,660
 And I wanted to run away.

245
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,170
 That man was my first and last lover.

246
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,270
 I was the only one who thought we were lovers,

247
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,680
 and to him, I was just a pitiful...

248
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,000
 child of God.

249
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,370
 The gem that we carried

250
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,330
 couldn't be shattered by anything,

251
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,380
 nor could it be melted.

252
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,000
 But that man was able to shatter mine for me.

253
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,560
And then I lost the ability to prophesy.

254
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,550
That's how I was able to become an ordinary person.

255
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,590
If it couldn't be shattered by anything,

256
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,080
then how did he do it?

257
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,040
And what should I do?

258
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,890
That's something

259
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,790
you need to find out for yourself.

260
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,290
By myself?

261
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,810
There's one thing you need to keep in mind.

262
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,930
Seul Bi has already accumulated many people's misfortunes in her body.

263
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,280
If she can't become an ordinary person as soon as possible,

264
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,080
she'll become a witch.

265
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,060
Are you confident that you can still love Seul Bi then?

266
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,690
Even if she becomes a witch and curses you?

267
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,530
How incredible.

268
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,860
I left only one final door alone.

269
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,510
And I set it up so that you could choose the password.

270
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,060
Thank you, Min Joon.

271
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,040
Shall we go outside?

272
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,530
It's so pretty.

273
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,790
Thank you, Min Joon.

274
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,150
Seul Bi,

275
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,550
let's go back.

276
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,800
Stop telling the future from now on.

277
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,540
Come with me.

278
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,230
I'll return this to you.

279
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,120
Seul Bi.

280
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,540
I'll make you into an ordinary person.

281
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,880
- I'll definitely find a way, so— 
 - No.

282
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,540
It's too late, Su Gwang.

283
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,640
I don't want to become ordinary anymore.

284
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,520
I also don't want to be indebted to you.

285
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,720
My ability...

286
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm going to enjoy it.

287
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,710
So go back.

288
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,150
Seul Bi.

289
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,330
What's going on?

290
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,320
Seul Bi says she doesn't want to.

291
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,430
Go back.

292
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,150
Like you said,

293
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,930
the only person I can rely on in the outside world is you.

294
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,310
That's why I must've been so obsessed.

295
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,440
If we meet next time,

296
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,930
let's just stay friends.

297
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,600
Geumhwa Group's trading value ended up

298
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,600
beating down on the shareholders without mercy!

299
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,100
Directors, you're all in pain, too, right?

300
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,820
How much is the loss?

301
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,290
So what's the reason you asked to see us, Chairman?

302
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,030
Well,

303
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,230
the son is trying to bring down his father.

304
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,500
If the court really

305
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,430
approves the application for limited guardianship

306
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,390
and the management rights fall to Min Joon,

307
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,950
how will that young child lead a major company like Geumhwa Group?

308
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,110
So don't you think that having you all support me

309
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,530
is the best outcome for Geumhwa Group?

310
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,890
But you already split with Geumhwa Group 20 years ago—

311
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,010
What do you mean split?

312
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,890
Geumhwa is a company that was founded by my father.

313
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,520
But that little brat—

314
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,550
I mean, Min Joon. If we leave Geumhwa in his hands,

315
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,740
the company that my father raised with his blood and sweat

316
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,920
will topple over.

317
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,480
As the eldest son,

318
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,590
I can't just stand back and watch.

319
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,770
For over 30 years,

320
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,870
all you directors who've been with Geumhwa like family...

321
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:27,140
I hope you make the right judgment for Geumhwa.

322
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,790
I leave everything in your care.

323
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,970
Have a safe trip back.

324
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,600
Hey.

325
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,510
If those raccoons end up coming over to my side,

326
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,180
how much does our friendly stake add up to?

327
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,240
We'll be able to secure 30% of Geumhwa Group's shares.

328
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,480
You're really incredible, Chairman.

329
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,970
I've been working like a dog all this time sh*tting blood,

330
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,570
and I've collected shares serving these lowly pieces of work.

331
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,670
I should get to wear Geumhwa's crown at least once, right?

332
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,450
Right?

333
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,040
Su Gwang, you're here.

334
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,620
It was difficult looking after the store by yourself, right?

335
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,790
Didn't you say you were going to meet Seul Bi?

336
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,170
Yes, well...

337
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,730
Hyeon Tae.

338
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,270
Oh my. Su Gwang, you were here too.

339
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,380
I just brought some chive pancakes as a midnight snack.

340
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,810
Mom.

341
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,700
What's with these clothes so late at night?

342
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,910
Are you going on a date?

343
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,130
Oh my, what's with you? I'm always dressed like this at home.

344
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,190
You're so funny.

345
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,730
Th-Thank you.

346
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,130
Yes.

347
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,370
But Ajussi, do you live here now?

348
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,000
Su Gwang said he felt bad that I lived in a tiny room,

349
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,450
so he told me that I could stay here for now.

350
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,590
Oh, Su Gwang did?

351
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,740
Su Gwang, isn't that a woman's ring?

352
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,270
If a woman's ring fits a man's pinky,

353
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,370
it's said that they're a match made in heaven.

354
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,440
- Su Gwang! 
 - Mom!

355
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,480
Why are you here when you said you'd make me some chive pancakes?

356
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,430
I'm hungry.

357
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,860
I left some in the kitchen. Eat those.

358
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,210
It's beer!

359
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,060
Hey. Hey, give it here.

360
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,840
Give it here. You must be crazy.

361
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,830
- What high school student drinks beer? 
 - Just one can.

362
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,250
Go downstairs and study.

363
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,420
No matter how I think about it, it looks like Seul Bi's.

364
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,460
Eun Joong, hurry up and go back down.

365
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,600
Mom, that looks like Seul Bi's, right?

366
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm so upset. So upset!

367
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,680
- Why are you so loud in someone else's house? 
 - I'm so upset!

368
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,560
I'm upset too because of you guys!

369
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:33,700
♫  On a sunny day with the warm light, suddenly  ♫

370
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,950
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

371
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,150
 Su Gwang's books.

372
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,420
 These are your dreams.

373
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,610
 So...

374
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,850
 I need to protect them.

375
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,550
 No, Seul Bi.

376
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,670
 These aren't important.

377
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,810
 You're the most important.

378
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,880
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

379
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,350
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

380
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:12,040
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

381
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:19,220
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

382
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:26,710
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

383
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:34,980
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

384
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,190
You're...

385
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,900
my son, Min Joon.

386
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,150
Even if you do nothing, Geumhwa will become yours anyway,

387
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,910
so what's the reason for your urgency?

388
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,360
Is it because of Seul Bi?

389
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,180
Because I can't trust you.

390
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,600
As soon as a crack appears in Geumhwa's sturdy walls,

391
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,300
the enemies are beginning to move.

392
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,810
Are you talking about Uncle?

393
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,050
He's been dragging away the shareholders.

394
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,140
How many?

395
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,990
So far, more than 30% of the shares have been confirmed

396
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,950
to have converted to him.

397
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,700
We're more than able to defend that much as well.

398
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,950
Shareholders will continue to turn their backs going forward.

399
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,430
This is the result of your attempt to drive me out.

400
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,650
Cancel the application for limited guardianship.

401
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,850
You're still too young to inherit Geumhwa

402
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,300
on your own.

403
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,740
You told me to show you my ability.

404
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,920
Min Joon.

405
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,700
What is Geumhwa to you?

406
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,960
A castle that you raised by abandoning Mother.

407
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,930
It's a tower that you built by sacrificing Mother.

408
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,310
So I won't let anyone steal it away from me.

409
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,090
I can't cancel the limited guardianship.

410
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,600
I will stop Uncle.

411
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,890
Chairman.

412
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,610
I'll try to convince Min Joon once more.

413
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,060
 It's a talisman to prevent nightmares.

414
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,970
 Our father once tried to get that thing.

415
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,180
 He doesn't need it anymore though.

416
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,450
Start by...

417
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,430
getting rid of this.

418
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,140
Is something wrong?

419
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,490
Yeah.

420
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,130
Just the same old things.

421
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,010
Should I help you?

422
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,220
No.

423
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,030
I'm not here because of that.

424
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,260
Then?

425
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,310
Seul Bi.

426
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,360
Yeah.

427
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,290
Let's be more than just friends.

428
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,330
Let me be your boyfriend.

429
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,330
 Eunsung Capital

430
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,510
What brings my high and mighty younger brother

431
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,750
to this lowly neighborhood?

432
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,530
Is this the first time since Eunsung Capital was established?

433
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,410
You picked a fight,

434
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,950
so the least I could do is accept it face-to-face.

435
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,010
What do you mean by a fight?

436
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,750
Sam Joong.

437
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,860
What kind of position is the one you hold as Geumhwa Group Chairman?

438
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,620
It's a position I attained by locking Father in a mental hospital

439
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,590
and driving you out.

440
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,090
How proud you are.

441
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,120
Right.

442
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,500
It's a position you acquired through such hardship,

443
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,620
but now that your son is trying to bring you down,

444
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,280
how unfairly treated and outraged you must feel.

445
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,150
So,

446
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,870
I'm going to take revenge for you

447
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,650
against your son.

448
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,550
You're going to take your unresolved emotions

449
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,180
out on your young nephew?

450
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,010
Unresolved?

451
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,870
Because you snatched away and ate what was meant for my mouth,

452
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,930
my insides have been burning, my mouth drying, and my hunger gnawing for 20 years!

453
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,510
They might seem like unresolved emotions to you,

454
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,260
but it feels new for me every day!

455
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,760
Then let me set you right once again.

456
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,690
Twenty years ago,

457
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,580
if you had inherited Geumhwa,

458
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,920
Geumhwa would not be the Geumhwa it is now

459
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,630
and would've stayed as the mere Eunsung Capital.

460
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,180
If you can't understand that and would like to act on your unresolved emotions,

461
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,800
please go ahead and try.

462
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,400
Fine. Let's give it a go. Give it a go!

463
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,700
What is this?

464
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,840
It's a six-root Cheonjong wild ginseng.

465
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,550
It's good for energy recovery,

466
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,130
so please make sure to eat it, Chairman.

467
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,960
Wild ginseng?

468
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,150
It's good quality.

469
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,580
Uncle, you're here.

470
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,750
Hey, Dong Sik!

471
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,850
I heard you've been diligent with company affairs these days.

472
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,910
I'm proud of you.

473
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,700
- It's about time I grow up. 
 - That's right.

474
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,840
I'll see you next time. All right then.

475
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,300
As expected, Uncle's dignity is on a different level from yours.

476
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,830
What? You punk!

477
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,300
Get out!

478
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
Stuff that freaking wild ginseng in your mouth, you bastard!

479
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,240
Do you have anger management issues?

480
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,980
You should get a psychiatric evaluation, too.

481
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,990
That bastard!

482
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,660
Sh*t.

483
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,520
That bastard!

484
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,910
Geez.

485
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,020
F**k!

486
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,190
What's that son of a b*tch Assistant Jeong up to?

487
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,690
Go and drag Assistant Jeong here!

488
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,450
Hello?

489
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,100
Ajussi, what's wrong?

490
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,510
Huh? Well...

491
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,960
Su Gwang, go on ahead.

492
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,390
What?

493
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,320
I just need to make a stop nearby.

494
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,640
What is it?

495
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,150
Assistant Jeong.

496
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,370
Did living in prison for 20 years

497
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,110
rid you of your sense of fear?

498
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,330
Th-That's not it, Chairman.

499
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,110
Seul Bi returned to Geumhwa Hotel.

500
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,510
Listen carefully.

501
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,540
If you don't bring your daughter to me by tomorrow,

502
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,390
I'll pluck those rolling eyeballs of yours

503
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,750
and make sure you'll never be able to see your daughter again.

504
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,030
- Thank you in advance. 
 - Yes, Chief Director.

505
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,130
We'll discuss this once more as soon as the major shareholders gather.

506
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,870
All right.

507
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,410
Who might that be?

508
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,990
I don't think she's your fiancée.

509
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,780
She's a distant niece of the Chairman.

510
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,690
She returned from overseas not too long ago.

511
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,300
I see.

512
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,900
Is something wrong?

513
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,690
Min Joon, can I make a brief trip outside?

514
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,870
Where are you going?

515
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,410
Just don't ask.

516
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,180
I'll make a quick trip by myself.

517
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,970
- All right, I'll gather the bodyguards. 
 - No.

518
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,240
I'll go alone.

519
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,970
Call me if anything happens.

520
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,140
 Chief Director Seon Min Joon

521
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,960
 Jo Jang Geun

522
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,370
Hey, Jang Geun.

523
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,100
- Aren't you busy? 
 - I am.

524
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,160
Don't you think a resident would be busy?

525
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,730
So what brings you here?

526
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,790
During my shift at the hospital,

527
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,900
do you know how often my mom comes by to badger me into contacting you?

528
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,370
I'm sorry.

529
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,410
Mom says you're being really weird.

530
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,780
Why are you not making any wedding preparations

531
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,520
and are going around taking care of your cousin with such attention?

532
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,970
I couldn't bring myself to tell her that she's not your cousin.

533
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,370
I'll tell your mother myself—

534
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,980
Whatever.

535
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,260
Mom made a reservation at Jang Gyeong's favorite restaurant,

536
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,140
so she told me to invite you. Here's the address and the time.

537
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,200
You saw this, right? I definitely relayed the message to you.

538
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,050
I don't care anymore.

539
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,710
- Jang Geun. 
 - I'm leaving.

540
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,640
You know the amount of Geumhwa Group shares that Jang Geun's hospital holds

541
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,620
is over 3%, right, Min Joon?

542
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,040
This...

543
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,260
is a gift I bought for you, Seul Bi.

544
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,490
I'm not your daughter.

545
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,110
I guess...

546
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,680
I did appear in rags.

547
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,790
Even I'm embarrassed to say I'm your dad.

548
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,710
You should be embarrassed about something else.

549
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,190
If I'm your daughter,

550
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,530
does that mean you tried to sell me off?

551
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,510
What do you mean?

552
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,060
You're trying to sell me for money.

553
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,080
No, no, no!

554
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,630
I've never considered that.

555
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,700
Come with me now.

556
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,830
To where?

557
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,460
Look at how down he looks.

558
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,240
I feel so bad for him.

559
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,890
Those shoulders the size of the Pacific Ocean

560
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,140
are sagging so much they're now the size of a stream.

561
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,350
The lover he was going to marry

562
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,070
showed up at the market with another man at her side.

563
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,110
Of course, he's feeling down.

564
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,150
Su Gwang!

565
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,160
Help me with this survey.

566
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,490
To explain this...

567
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,520
Since the remodeling project fell through last time,

568
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,360
whether we want to change the company and start again,

569
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,050
or if we want to switch to the internet shopping business.

570
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,400
It's a survey for people's opinions.

571
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,890
Oh, I see.

572
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,110
But did Mr. Jeong go somewhere?

573
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,600
Yes.

574
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,730
No.

575
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,820
- We're going to run through it again. 
 - Wh-Why, why, why?

576
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,310
I mean,

577
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,750
do you really

578
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,790
have to leave this to Brother-in-law— I mean, Su Gwang right now?

579
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,470
Why not?

580
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,580
Can't you tell he's lovesick right now?

581
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,320
Lovesick?

582
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,350
He was fine until a few days ago.

583
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,190
The thing is that it doesn't appear immediately.

584
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,330
As more time passes,

585
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,970
it grows like a bean sprout

586
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,960
and grows out from within.

587
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,830
How do you know that so well?

588
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,140
You said I was your first love.

589
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,400
Su Gwang!

590
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,440
Isn't the weather beautiful today?

591
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,230
Which brings me to...

592
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:55,050
Would you like to meet me on the rooftop tonight?

593
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,640
 Hello?

594
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,540
 Hyeongnim, I can explain.

595
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,080
How does chicken and beer sound?

596
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,640
- Eun Jung. 
 - Yes.

597
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,060
Please look after the shop for me.

598
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,840
Okay.

599
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,690
Don't worry, Su Gwang!

600
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,260
He asked me to look after the shop for him.

601
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,550
 Geoseong Private Loans

602
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,570
Please have a cup of coffee.

603
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,450
Aigoo.

604
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,130
Aigoo!

605
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,640
Any difficulties for you?

606
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,270
The office is a bit small,

607
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,340
but it's tolerable.

608
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,360
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

609
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,920
- Okay, enjoy. 
 - Sure.

610
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,090
Hyeong!

611
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,000
Hyeong.

612
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,510
- Hyeong. 
 - Yes, Su Gwang.

613
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,940
- Last time at the Chinese restaurant... 
 - Chinese restaurant?

614
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,370
Excuse me.

615
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:57,130
Do you know the man who was with Seon Dong Sik last time at the Chinese restaurant?

616
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,770
Oh, the Eunsung Capital Chairman's minion?

617
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,310
He's the secretary.

618
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,410
Manager Yeom.

619
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,070
Chairman Seon Il Joong's secretary?

620
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,750
Hey.

621
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,890
Where are you going?

622
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,670
 Eunsung Capital

623
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,840
At last, I meet the female shaman of prophecies face-to-face.

624
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,110
Oh? I see.

625
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,690
I shouldn't be like this. Right, right.

626
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,060
Sit, sit. Over here.

627
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,840
What are you doing?

628
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,680
Sit.

629
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,900
Manager Yeom,

630
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,770
give Assistant Jeong what we have prepared for him.

631
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,830
Give that to me.

632
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,730
Huh?

633
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,990
I'm telling you the future with my ability,

634
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,410
so you should give the money to me.

635
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,940
Your daughter is quite bright.

636
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,490
Let's just go, Seul Bi.

637
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,590
Chairman,

638
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,040
no matter how I think about this, it's—

639
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,950
You a**hole!

640
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,310
I don't need the money,

641
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:34,030
and I no longer want to be involved with the Seon family.

642
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,850
Now you're feeling guilty all of a sudden?

643
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,220
You tried to sell her mom over 20 years ago, too.

644
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,670
Chairman!

645
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,240
Didn't you hear that from your mom?

646
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,430
This bastard tried to sell your mom over 20 years ago.

647
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,970
That... that's... you see, Seul Bi...

648
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,670
I did think about it momentarily,

649
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,710
but I didn't sell her off.

650
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,990
It's true, Seul Bi.

651
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,500
I guess you want to be a good dad to your daughter?

652
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,200
That's why I was in prison for 20 years, Seul Bi.

653
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,590
I regretted it all this time.

654
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,930
I'm telling the truth, Seul Bi.

655
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,070
I know.

656
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,120
That's why I'm going to earn this money and give it to you.

657
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,700
Huh?

658
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,510
Whoa, you really brought the female shaman here, Father.

659
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,190
Hi.

660
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,940
You make fortune-telling business trips, too?

661
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,510
As you desire, I'll tell you your fortune.

662
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,860
But on one condition.

663
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,130
Condition?

664
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,260
Don't ever harass my dad again.

665
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,140
Dad?

666
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,100
What an affectionate father-daughter relationship.

667
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,770
Fine.

668
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,370
As long as you do as I ask,

669
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,190
why would I harass your dad?

670
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:04,690
No, no, no, no, Seul Bi! Don't do this.

671
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:26,300
It's not me. There's someone else's fortune you must tell.

672
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,380
Whose?

673
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,890
I'll arrange a meeting with someone special for you soon.

674
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,660
Make sure you come then.

675
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,450
I'll even compensate you handsomely.

676
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,080
All right.

677
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,890
Then please call me.

678
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:43,170
Let's go, Seul Bi. Okay? Let's go.

679
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,920
You don't have anything to tell me today?

680
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,000
Your fee?

681
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,630
Let's go.

682
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,250
Let's go.

683
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,580
Father, who will you assign her to?

684
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:09,070
Someone who'll help me regain Geumhwa.

685
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,890
Who's that?

686
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,780
You don't need to know, punk.

687
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,120
Geez. Come on...

688
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,330
Things are all twisted up!

689
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,800
What's wrong, Father?

690
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,920
Because you guys fired this a**hole,

691
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,060
he keeps threatening me!

692
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,640
Who?

693
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,430
Geoseong Private Loans' CEO Choi?

694
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,790
That a**hole dares to threaten you?

695
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,470
Look into what I told you.

696
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,570
I'll just have to kill that bastard.

697
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,050
 Eunsung Capital

698
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,750
Those people won't harass you from now on.

699
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,710
I'm sorry, Seul Bi.

700
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,640
- As your dad— 
 - Ajussi.

701
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,400
You're not my dad.

702
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,710
I just thought it'd be convenient if Chairman Seon Il Joong believed that earlier.

703
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,740
Su Gwang.

704
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,050
What are you doing right now?

705
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,850
You met Chairman Seon Il Jung and brought Seul Bi with you?

706
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,150
What did you do with that man?

707
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,110
Well...

708
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,020
That man involved gangsters in looking for Seul Bi.

709
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,110
Why would you bring Seul Bi to someone like that?

710
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,340
Su Gwang, I'm fine.

711
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,120
Nothing happened?

712
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,510
Yeah.

713
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,400
Let's go eat at the market.

714
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,750
Su Gwang!

715
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,640
You asked me to look after the shop

716
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,240
and went to meet her?

717
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,670
You're so cruel!

718
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,860
Eun Joong.

719
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,900
I'll tidy up the shop, so go ahead and eat.

720
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,840
Let's do it together.

721
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,070
No, no. Seul Bi's hungry.

722
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,700
Go on.

723
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,640
What is it?

724
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,990
Manager Yeom.

725
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:43,250
Yes.

726
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,760
I'm going to ask you a question.

727
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,720
Why is CEO Choi threatening my dad?

728
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,160
Manager Yeom.

729
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,580
Well...

730
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,010
I think it's because of the Gong Su Gwang incident two years ago.

731
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,850
Su Gwang's incident?

732
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,230
Yes.

733
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,320
What does that have to do with my father?

734
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,020
Answer me!

735
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,150
Goodbye.

736
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,550
Goodbye.

737
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,470
Gosh, it's so busy.

738
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,200
This is delicious.

739
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,910
Mrs. Bang, you must be making a lot of money.

740
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,880
This is all thanks to our Seul Bi.

741
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,960
Eat up. Everything's free for you today. Free.

742
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,530
Since you make a lot of money, please fix the roof.

743
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:40,710
Water leaks from the ceiling when it rains.

744
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,310
Oh my, it leaks there when it rains?

745
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,840
I told you about 20 times that it leaks whenever it rains.

746
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,600
If it's a favor for you, I'll fulfill anything you ask of me.

747
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,270
If anything is bothering you in the future, please let me know.

748
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,700
Seul Bi is here! Seul Bi!

749
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,110
- Oh my gosh! 
 - Seul Bi!

750
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,100
- It's been so long. 
 - It's so good to see you.

751
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,920
It's nice to see you!

752
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,920
Mrs. Bang!

753
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,280
- Give us some beer. 
 - Okay, okay.

754
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,090
Seul Bi, I missed you so much.

755
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,270
Oh my, what happened to your face?

756
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,700
Aigoo, you can tell she's been lovesick with one look at her face.

757
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,870
These two were lovesick as a couple?

758
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,340
- Huh? 
 - Is that so?

759
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,500
Apparently, the medicine for lovesickness is the man you like.

760
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,600
But did you dump that guy from last time?

761
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,210
What's wrong with you? You're getting worse.

762
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,750
- Gosh! 
 - Seriously!

763
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,410
For goodness sake.

764
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,060
You have zero tact.

765
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,460
Why are you only picking on me?

766
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,760
My gosh!

767
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,240
Lovesick!

768
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,850
Why am I so healthy?

769
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,010
My heart is lovesick,

770
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,260
but my body won't cooperate.

771
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,980
Eun Joong! I like a healthy woman.

772
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,930
A police officer shouldn't be stalking someone!

773
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,860
He's not stalking you.

774
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,800
This chicken restaurant is the best these days.

775
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,990
Chicken King!

776
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,290
Take this with you and leave.

777
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,740
The Cane of the People will take our leave now. 
  (TN: The police's motto, meaning they support the people.)

778
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,290
Salute!

779
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,330
Salute! Go on!

780
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,900
Hang in there!

781
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,940
Eun Joong, Officer Kim is a good man.

782
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,600
- Government employees are good. 
 - That's right.

783
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,400
We'll come back after closing the store.

784
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,970
- Okay, sure. Sure. 
 - Don't leave!

785
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,400
Hurry back!

786
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,740
- Eonni. 
 - Yes.

787
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,110
I have a favor to ask.

788
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:25,650
If it's a favor for you, I'll fulfill anything you ask of me.

789
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,560
What is this situation?

790
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,640
You're making it so blatant that you two are the closest.

791
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,230
How upsetting.

792
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,670
I also have a favor to ask of Mr. Hong and Mr. Park.

793
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,110
- Huh? 
 - Me, too?

794
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,420
What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it?

795
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,300
Okay, okay.

796
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,310
I absolutely understand what you're saying.

797
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,570
Whoa!

798
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,590
- Miss Seul Bi! 
 - Mr. Wang!

799
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,760
Okay, then. We should go.

800
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,990
- Yes, let's go. Let's go. 
 - Yeah.

801
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,130
We're leaving, Seul Bi.

802
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,510
Don't worry about the favor you asked.

803
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,230
Don't worry.

804
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,420
Aigoo. What about the alcohol?

805
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,870
CEO Wang here will drink everything.

806
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,180
Sit, sit, sit.

807
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,290
What's going on?

808
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,090
Enjoy the food.

809
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:21,130
Where are you going?

810
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,300
Goodbye.

811
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,350
- What the? 
 - Mr. Wang.

812
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,380
Yes?

813
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,870
I have a favor to ask.

814
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,860
Yes, go ahead.

815
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,670
This is so delicious.

816
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,570
Why did you ask for all those favors when we came here to eat some chicken?

817
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,450
You don't need to know.

818
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,460
Go on and eat.

819
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,910
Don't be too hard on Mr. Jeong.

820
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,130
He's having a really tough time.

821
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,840
All right.

822
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,850
I won't say anything to him.

823
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,500
Seul Bi.

824
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,530
Thank you

825
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,180
for always protecting me.

826
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,530
What are you saying all of a sudden?

827
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,480
Thank you for telling me that you like me.

828
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:40,690
Thank you for becoming my goddess of good fortune.

829
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,660
That's why I also want to do that for you.

830
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,220
It's okay if you just think of me as a friend—

831
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,280
No.

832
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,980
It's okay if you think of me as only an acquaintance.

833
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,830
I just want to

834
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,320
like you.

835
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:09,050
Why are you saying that while we're eating?

836
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,130
Sorry.

837
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,960
If not now, I don't think I'll have another chance to tell you that.

838
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,940
I even returned the ring to you.

839
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,880
Why would you say that?

840
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,550
I'm taking good care of the ring.

841
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,480
Did you meet that person?

842
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,880
The person who came looking for Gong Su Gwang.

843
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,430
Yeah.

844
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,790
This person

845
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:45,350
is the one you wrote the letter to, right?

846
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,470
 Seoul Stone Culture Museum Director Eun Ok Jin

847
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,270
What did this person say?

848
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,560
Welcome.

849
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,770
Seul Bi..

850
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,150
Min Joon.

851
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,440
This is where you wanted to go?

852
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,710
Let's go, Seul Bi.

853
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,700
Did you follow me?

854
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,730
I came looking for you because you didn't come back.

855
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,860
Take her.

856
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,560
Please come along.

857
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,070
Hey, Seon Min Joon.

858
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,190
What are you doing right now?

859
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,170
Is this how you treat Seul Bi?

860
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,400
It's okay, Su Gwang.

861
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,540
I was going to go anyway.

862
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,600
I'll go now.

863
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,570
Let me talk to you in private.

864
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,470
What should

865
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,890
I do for you?

866
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,690
What can I do about that incident two years ago?

867
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:01,860
Tell me what I can do for you, Su Gwang.

868
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,210
Seul Bi...

869
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,340
will you continue to keep her locked away?

870
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,000
You two broke up.

871
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,880
I still like her.

872
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,100
Seul Bi still likes me, too.

873
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,570
Then why did Seul Bi return to me?

874
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,130
Do you think she returned to you?

875
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,230
It's the house she was born and raised in.

876
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,290
And her mom is there, too.

877
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,800
You think...

878
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,130
she returned to you?

879
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,850
Su Gwang.

880
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,160
I'll do everything you want, everything you tell me to do.

881
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,910
I'll get down on my knees and beg for forgiveness.

882
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,600
I'll do anything.

883
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,370
But...

884
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,110
I can't give up Seul Bi.

885
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,630
I can't give Seul Bi up either.

886
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,140
Then Seul Bi will be the one to decide.

887
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,910
Don't hold...

888
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:13,000
- Seul Bi's hand. 
 - That's also for Seul Bi to decide.

889
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,890
I'll go now.

890
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,800
The more fortunes she tells, the more danger she'll be in.

891
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,330
So don't hold...

892
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,230
Seul Bi's hand.

893
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,220
 It's not me. There's someone else's fortune you must tell.

894
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:58,870
 Whose?

895
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,480
 I'll arrange a meeting with someone special for you soon.

896
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,510
 Make sure you come then.

897
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,930
Ajussi.

898
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,430
You didn't even have dinner.

899
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,720
No.

900
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,370
What I had for lunch won't digest,

901
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:18,210
so I feel stuffed up. It won't go down.

902
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:21,230
Then you should eat medicine, not alcohol.

903
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,570
Hold on.

904
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,880
You can just eat it as is.

905
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,890
Thank you, Su Gwang.

906
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,700
I feel more refreshed now.

907
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,620
But Ajussi.

908
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,590
Why did you bring Seul Bi to Chairman Seon Il Jung?

909
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,300
What happened there?

910
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:04,330
What did Chairman Seon Il Jung say to Seul Bi?

911
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,780
What?

912
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:08,940
It's nothing. Nothing.

913
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,850
Nothing much happened.

914
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,730
Please don't do that again, Ajussi.

915
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:36,190
 Samsam Supermarket

916
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,490
What brings you here?

917
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,880
How have you been, Su Gwang?

918
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,770
What's the reason you're here?

919
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,220
I wasn't aware that you were meeting with Min Joon.

920
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,130
You must regret that you couldn't block me off more thoroughly.

921
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,570
Yes.

922
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,560
I should've blocked you off more thoroughly.

923
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,650
I'm regretting it.

924
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:02,500
Is that the way you people think?

925
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,950
Do you people not even feel the slightest guilt for what happened two years ago?

926
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,680
The misfortunate incident that happened to you two years ago

927
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,440
was not the chairman's doing.

928
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,620
You expect me to believe that?

929
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,770
You might not believe it,

930
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,020
but that's the truth.

931
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,920
Then who did it?

932
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,610
I said, who did it?

933
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,050
The chairman

934
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:28,940
would like to see you.

935
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,670
Will I be able to hear the answer if I meet him?

936
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,780
Then I have no reason to meet him.

937
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:40,490
 Samsam Supermarket

938
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,290
Aigoo, aigoo.

939
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,760
Aigoo, why are you carrying such heavy things?

940
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,420
You packed just about everything.

941
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,960
It's a waste... sir.

942
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,990
Then should I throw everything out?

943
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,550
These are all important things.

944
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,960
All the things the boss told me to hold on to.

945
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,250
How important can they be?

946
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:17,300

947
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,420
 I have a favor to ask.

948
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,700
 Give the toy that your secretary brings

949
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,310
 to Su Gwang.

950
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:27,830
 You must.

951
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:36,130
♫  On a day not so far away  ♫

952
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:41,360
♫  On the day you were by my side  ♫

953
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:47,430
♫  Green leaves grow on the sunny street  ♫

954
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:52,810
♫  Everything in this world was warm  ♫

955
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:58,490
♫  It was hard, but I was happy to meet you  ♫

956
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:01,360
♫  Knowing that the years will pass  ♫

957
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,140
 Jinxed at First

958
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,890
 - Su Gwang! 
 - What is this?

959
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:09,410
 She said to deliver the toy that my secretary brings me to Su Gwang.

960
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:10,330
 Seul Bi did?

961
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:13,660
 Can't you go back outside even now?

962
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:18,040
 Mom, I will find a way for all of us to become happy.

963
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,860
 I'm not the one who's holding on to Seul Bi.

964
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,180
 What does that mean?

965
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,580
 Seul Bi is staying there willingly.

966
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,150
 - What is the meaning of this? 
 - You're here!

967
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,290
 Yes, Chairman.

968
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:36,130
♫  If I miss your warm hand, I sometimes...  ♫
