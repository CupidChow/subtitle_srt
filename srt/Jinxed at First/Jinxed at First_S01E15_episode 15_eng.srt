00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,460
 Episode 15

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,870
The wealth and fame you've accumulated and this great castle.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,300
You said it was all so you could hand them over to me.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,480
Thank you, Father.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,780
Thank you for everything you've given me.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,690
But I think I might stray from your expectations again.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,570
I'm going to disband Geumhwa Group.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,420
I'm going to give the sale amount back to society.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,920
I think that's the way we can end this curse that the men in our family

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,800
have borne from generation to generation.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,410
I'm sorry for disappointing you until the end, Father.

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,630
I now have to finish my part.

13
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,140
It was my lifelong wish

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,170
to become an ordinary woman

15
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,470
who receives an ordinary man's love.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,670
My Seul Bi, you were always like that since you were young.

17
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,030
"Mom, do you think it will snow tomorrow?"

18
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,400
"Do you think Santa will come tomorrow?"

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,350
"Do you think we'll see a bird through the window?"

20
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,520
I was like that?

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,360
Thanks to you, I always looked forward to tomorrow.

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,280
Thinking tomorrow will be the day Seul Bi looks forward to.

23
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,970

24
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,820
Seul Bi.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,150
You must become an ordinary person.

26
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,500
 Don't worry.

27
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,430
 No matter what happens, I'll protect her with my life.

28
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,070
 A long time ago, when I first saw you,

29
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,060
 the future you showed me was my life's hope.

30
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,180
 Someone who loves Seul Bi that much will appear one day.

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:51,570
 One day, Seul Bi will be with someone she loves so much.

32
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 Toward you, I feel so sorry and ashamed,

33
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,780
 but even after I leave,

34
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,870
 please take good care of my Seul Bi.

35
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,360
Seul Bi.

36
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,270
Chairman and Ms. Mi Su...

37
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,480
They've left, huh?

38
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,850
What are you doing?

39
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,950
What is all this?

40
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
Invitations.

41
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,740
Invitations?

42
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,870
Yeah.

43
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,330
♫  The sky is so more dazzling tonight  ♫

44
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,330
I'm going to invite everyone officially.

45
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,480
Everyone did their best to prepare a birthday party for me.

46
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,750
It ended in a mess.

47
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,330
♫  Sweeter than sunshine  ♫

48
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,550
They even came to the press conference to defend me.

49
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm going to invite them this time.

50
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,220
Wow, you drew them really well.

51
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,570
Who's this?

52
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,710
Who is this?

53
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,400
It's Smile Eonni!

54
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,300
She was smiling so big that I didn't recognize her.

55
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,140
She smiles easily now.

56
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,920
I invite you to Seul Bi's secret temple.

57
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,220
- Do you think they'll like it? 
 - Of course.

58
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I've packed all your belongings.

59
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,240
The two of you will be quite comfortable for a while.

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,510
Then I'll take my leave now.

61
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,580
You said the police contacted you?

62
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,210
I must pay for my crimes.

63
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,350
Hyung.

64
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,270
Let me hug you just once.

65
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,280
 The Citizen's Reliable Police Who Are With the People

66
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,900
 The Citizen's Reliable Police Who Are With the People

67
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,640
What do you mean arrest?

68
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,790
Why did Secretary Cha go to the police without a word to us?

69
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,270
Secretary Cha must've testified that he alone is responsible

70
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,860
for everything related to Ms. Min's confinement.

71
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,760
Secretary Cha did that for Father.

72
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,760
I contacted Attorney Park for now, and I'm planning to apply for bail.

73
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,800
Secretary Cha went to the police and turned himself in.

74
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,640
He took all the blame for Chairman Seon Sam Joong's illegal activities.

75
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,320
I was going to trample on that son of a b*tch too.

76
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,350
Why the f*** did he turn himself in?

77
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Madames.

78
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,520
- Yes? 
 - Yes?

79
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,310
You should give it your all this time, shouldn't you?

80
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,500
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

81
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,800
Right?

82
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,900
Yes.

83
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,540
Take them.

84
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,510
Isn't he a crazy bastard?

85
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,320
I didn't know he was that kind of person either.

86
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,710
What do we do?

87
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,510
He's a complete psycho, isn't he?

88
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,350

So you're saying the actual owners of Geumhwa Group are female shamans?

89
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,080
 Yes!

90
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,270
For generations, the female shamans stood behind each president

91
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,920
and manipulated them with hypnosis and prophecies to make them all listen to them.

92
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,160
If they didn't listen, they made them delusional using hypnosis

93
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,230
and eventually made them mentally ill. Is that what you're saying?

94
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,980
Yes! If you witness their manipulation in person, it's quite terrifying.

95
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,470
You think manipulating them was all they did?

96
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,800
They probably siphoned their energy, too.

97
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,090
Exactly.

98
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,990
So, in the end, Chairman Seon Ju Cheol got his energy siphoned by the female shamans

99
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,910
and died as nothing but a shell of himself.

100
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,660
That's so cruel.

101
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,630
Wow, this is totally...

102
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,610
Let's see. They're not female shamans.

103
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,790
They're more like witches, no? Witches!

104
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,340
But where is everyone?

105
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,230
I know. Mr. Jeong isn't there either.

106
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,120
Did they go to eat?

107
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,680
- Hello. 
 - Hello!

108
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,490
Ta-da!

109
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,330
We're throwing a party at our house.

110
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,500
- Please come. 
 - Party?

111
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,910
We're too busy, so I don't think we'll be able to go.

112
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,770
Still, Seul Bi prepared this with great care out of gratitude.

113
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,710
Please come even if you're busy.

114
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm sorry. Yeong Wu is really sick.

115
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,620
Yeah, we're really busy.

116
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,810
S-Sorry.

117
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,040
How could that happen?

118
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,630
- It must be true! 
- Geez!

119
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,050
- Bosses! 
 - Oh my, Seul—

120
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,600
Hello.

121
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,490
We're throwing a party at our house this weekend.

122
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,780
Please come.

123
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,780
You see...

124
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,260
What's wrong with everyone?

125
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,480
Look at me standing here when it's time for my merchandise to arrive.

126
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,960
I'll go ahead now. Sorry, Seul Bi.

127
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,370
Geez.

128
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,800
Eonni.

129
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,630
My hand...

130
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,370
I've been really busy these days.

131
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,370
What should I do?

132
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,640
I think my herniated disc has regressed.

133
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,630
I'll put a warm compress on it. Why does my back hurt so much?

134
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,720
Where are you going?

135
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,530
- Is something going on? 
 - Huh?

136
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,530
But...

137
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,100
if I've already touched her hand,

138
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,250
does that mean I've been cursed?

139
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,710
What are you talking about?

140
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,190
- Well, you see— 
 - Oppa, there's something on your shirt.

141
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,910
- Oh, really? 
  - Su Gwang!

142
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,710
Seul Bi!

143
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,800
- Oppa, why would you ask her that? 
 - Let go of me!

144
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,830
Rumors are flying

145
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,410
that Mi Su and Seul Bi manipulated Chairmans Seon Ju Cheol and Seon Sam Joong and turned them insane.

146
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,490
Who would spread a rumor like that?

147
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,210
On the internet, they said that they control and hypnotize people while telling their fortunes

148
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,150
and that they're witches.

149
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,980
It's probably Seon Dong Sik again.

150
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,890
It's all right.

151
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,110
It's not like they're entirely wrong.

152
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,500
Seul Bi,

153
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,160
let's go back for today.

154
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,370
Sure.

155
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,980
Oh my. Oh my. Oh my! Oh my!

156
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,470
She's here. She has come. It's the witch!

157
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,050
The witch who siphoned the Geumhwa Group Chairman's energy. The witch! The witch!

158
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,170
Come here. Come on!

159
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,180
Come here!

160
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,400
You've brought along all the evil spirits of the universe with you.

161
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,660
Disappear, Witch.

162
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,310
You're a big ghost!

163
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,050
Stop it. Stop. Just stop it!

164
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,090
Su Gwang, hurry up and leave with Seul Bi.

165
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,990
Disappear, you ghost. Ghost, disappear!

166
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,980
Stop it already! Stop it!

167
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,940
You tell fortunes, too!

168
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,540
Then what are you?

169
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,400
I'm a shaman.

170
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,690
And she's a witch!

171
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,540
Geez.

172
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,510
Go. Go away!

173
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,340
It's the witch! Witch, disappear!

174
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Let's go back.

175
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,630
Hey, you don't think I did something weird

176
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,630
because I've been cursed by Seul Bi, do you?

177
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,290
I didn't hold her hand and get my fortune told, so that's a relief, but...

178
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,670
I held her hand multiple times. Is that why I feel so weak?

179
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,460
I washed my hands, but I still feel uneasy.

180
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,380
Say something.

181
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,560
Did late Chairman Seon Ju Cheol and Chairman Seon Sam Joong really go insane

182
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,700
because of the female shamans?

183
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,460
- Why are you so curious about that? 
 - Scared me!

184
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,240
I mean, all of us held Seul Bi's hands so we're just scared.

185
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,670
You were all rejoicing about great business, thanks to Seul Bi's fortune telling!

186
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,320
You hurt her feelings like that just because you held her hand once?

187
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,020
I mean, when did we ever hurt her feelings, Hyeon Tae?

188
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,970
All of you, just give it a rest, will you?

189
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,430
How kind was Seul Bi to all of you?

190
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,440
I know! I know, but...

191
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,710
they're saying that someone actually went insane, so I'm just scared.

192
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,250
Those d*mned god-forsaken bastards just

193
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,100
received the punishment they deserve for their crimes!

194
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,200
Our Seul Bi didn't do anything wrong!

195
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,070
All of you, just give it a rest. You too, Mrs. Bang.

196
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,580
I'm disappointed in you, Mrs. Bang.

197
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,510
Eonni, Eonni.

198
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,880
- Why are you treating me like this? 
 - Eonni.

199
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,850
- Aigoo. 
 - But still, if we've been cursed—

200
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,620
Curse, my a**!

201
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,070
Everyone, just go back inside!

202
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,390
- Go back inside! Go inside! 
 - All right, all right.

203
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,450
- Go inside! 
 - All right.

204
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,930
Drink this.

205
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,870
It'll calm your nerves.

206
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,480
It might seem like people have turned their backs on you now,

207
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,540
but they'll return to you in no time.

208
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,500
Look at me.

209
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,140
I was once the most unfortunate man in Seodong Market,

210
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,570
but now I'm what?

211
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,450
The man of good fortune.

212
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,100
Right?

213
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,500
I want to sleep.

214
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,070
Don't think about anything, and just sleep.

215
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,540
Okay.

216
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,400
 It's getting closer.

217
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,280
 Will it really turn out that way?

218
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,340
 It's that woman!

219
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,820
 You've brought along all the evil spirits of the universe with you.

220
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,410
 No matter what decision I make,

221
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,190
 if that future ends up happening...

222
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,950
 No.

223
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,250
 There's no way. I'll prevent it for sure.

224
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,650
 Even if it means I'll become a witch.

225
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,100
So you were here.

226
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,790
How are you, Director?

227
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,570
Do I look like I'm doing well?

228
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm sorry for inconveniencing you with our family's problems—

229
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,750
Where's the chairman?

230
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,010
I hear he's been mentally unstable.

231
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,230
How could I think of marrying off my Jang Gyeong to a family like this?

232
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,840
I get goosebumps just thinking about it.

233
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,950
- I'm truly sorry. 
 - You think sorry's going to cut it?

234
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,940
Half-sister?

235
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,090
Shaman?

236
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,900
And to top it off,

237
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,520
I hear that there was something going on between you and that shaman.

238
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,530
And you still dare to try and marry my Jang Gyeong?

239
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,010
My relationship with my sister is not what you think it is.

240
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,800
I won't say much for fear of dirtying my mouth.

241
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,630
Let's say this engagement never happened.

242
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,380
Don't you dare contact my Jang Gyeong in the future.

243
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,190
Jang Gyeong.

244
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,440
- My mom left, right? 
 - What are you doing here?

245
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,920
What if you get your photo taken by reporters while you're here?

246
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,280
So what? We're going to get married anyway.

247
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,670
Your mother just broke off our engagement.

248
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,140
I'm at an age where I can get married without my parents' consent.

249
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,870
By chance, did you...

250
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,840
I left home.

251
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,210
Jang Gyeong,

252
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,160
I think it'd be best for you to listen to your parents for now.

253
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,710
Nope, doing as I say is probably better right now.

254
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,390
You know how stubborn I am, right?

255
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,590
I'm not leaving this place until I marry you.

256
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,080
I'll prepare a room for you for now.

257
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,890
Gosh, seriously.

258
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,280
I could just stay in your room with you.

259
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,010
We're going to get married anyway. So what?

260
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,810
Where's my room?

261
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,930
Jang Gyeong!

262
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,800
Seul Bi!

263
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,750
So this is the place!

264
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,990
The secret space you live in. Right?

265
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,340
Wow, how magnificent.

266
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,420
It's like I entered a world of magic.

267
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,440
People are calling you a witch. Is that true?

268
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,760
Let's go now, Jang Gyeong.

269
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,870
I like witches.

270
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,640
My favorite character

271
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,900
is the Good Witch of the North from "The Wizard of Oz."

272
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,780
Then let's be friends from now on.

273
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,890
I'd love to.

274
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,560
I can look around some more, right?

275
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,750
What about Su Gwang?

276
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,250
He's busy all day today.

277
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,110
What is he doing that he's leaving my sister all alone?

278
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,700
You should be more worried about your girlfriend than me, Oppa.

279
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,490
Wow, what is this?

280
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,960
Go on.

281
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,670
Jang Gyeong! Shall we go now?

282
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,130
Oppa, come here!

283
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,110
Seon Dong Sik's movements are suspicious.

284
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,380
I thought he'd take off overseas,

285
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,140
but there are rumors that he's gathering people in the country.

286
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,590
What is he trying to do?

287
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,190
Is he trying to become an organized crime boss?

288
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,380
What about the police?

289
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,300
Well, you see...

290
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,380
I found the fake license plate and a burner phone number

291
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,320
that Manager Yeom created and informed the police station.

292
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,920
Then I'm certain that

293
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,130
the GPS tracking should be possible,

294
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,820
but there's no movement whatsoever.

295
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,010
You don't think...

296
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,060
That's right.

297
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,830
He has someone on his side in the police force.

298
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,100
Seon Dong Sik probably knows we're on your side.

299
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,240
What if Seon Dong Sik kills us at this rate?

300
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,320
If the police are in on it, too?

301
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,480
We need to do whatever it takes to find that bastard, Seon Dong Sik, first.

302
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,120
I'll look for ideal places and search through them one by one.

303
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,210
We need to catch that punk first

304
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,040
and throw him to the prosecutors all tied up.

305
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,700
Be careful, Hyeong.

306
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,600
But is Miss Seul Bi all right?

307
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,150
Some weird rumors were going around.

308
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,570
She's having a bit of a hard time.

309
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,950
The one going around on the internet?

310
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,590
I saw that, too.

311
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,980
Is she really a witch?

312
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,930
Hey, don't say that.

313
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,050
No, she's not.

314
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,030
What I mean is that I'm jealous.

315
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,450
She has abilities.

316
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,500
That's right. She has abilities.

317
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,060
Take good care of Miss Seul Bi, okay?

318
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,440
I have customers, and I'm busy. Why are you calling us here?

319
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,880
Why are you gathering us here?

320
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,220
Everyone, be quiet!

321
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,240
Su Gwang says he has something to say.

322
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,050
- He's still mad. 
 - Why are you yelling?

323
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,400
- Exactly. 
 - All right, Su Gwang.

324
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,650
Go ahead.

325
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,610
In Seul Bi's room,

326
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,390
there are no windows.

327
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,570
She was so curious about the outside world,

328
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,890
but books were the only way for her to learn about the world,

329
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,290
so she read them over and over again 200 times.

330
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,600
That's why she only knew how to speak like a book.

331
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,140
Seul Bi wanted to fly far, far away into the outside world,

332
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,620
so she was really jealous of paper airplanes.

333
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,140
For 20 years.

334
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,880
From when she was a baby until she turned five years old,

335
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,650
and even after she turned 10 years old, then 20 years old,

336
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,740
the thing she envied most was a paper airplane.

337
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,260
The world she first met after escaping from that terrible place was Seodong Market.

338
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,410
Seodong Market was the whole world to Seul Bi.

339
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,620
The Seodong Market bosses are

340
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,600
everyone that Seul Bi knows in this entire world.

341
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,800
And Seul Bi

342
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,370
really loves every single person she knows in this world.

343
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,550
Seul Bi poured her love into these and made them with great care.

344
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,590
So please,

345
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,940
I hope all of you, who are the entire world to her,

346
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,030
don't turn your back on Seul Bi.

347
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,740
Aigoo, how touching.

348
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,360
This...

349
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,670
I-I think this is me.

350
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,200
You heard him.

351
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,770
She says we're the entire world to her.

352
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,970
Oppa, come on.

353
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,350
Since you put it that way,

354
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,640
I feel strange.

355
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,500
Aigoo, this...

356
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,540
This is me.

357
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,800
She drew me so well.

358
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,040
Aigoo.

359
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,500
Mrs. Bang.

360
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,500
Hyeon Tae, don't misunderstand.

361
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,810
We don't get swayed by watching those things on the internet.

362
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,910
Aigoo.

363
00:23:54,910 --> 00:24:00,070
Then this is a free pass to a place that's been off-limits for 20 years!

364
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,960
- You're right! 
 - Right.

365
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,180
But what if it's a weird place like a haunted house?

366
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,590
Stop saying "strange or weird" now.

367
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,920
I wonder if a chaebol's house has a bed in the bathroom.

368
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,900
This is great. Should I seduce a chaebol man then? Like this?

369
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,790
- Seduce one! 
 - Officer Kim!

370
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,950
What about Officer Kim?

371
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,220
Then are we all going to Seul Bi's house?

372
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,180
Definitely!

373
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,930
Then what should I wear?

374
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,400
I have nothing to wear but this.

375
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,750
Don't worry!

376
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,390
Come to my shop. I have dresses in all the colors of the rainbow.

377
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,860
- Yes, yes, yes! 
 - Come, come!

378
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,450
You heard us, right?

379
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,750
We're all going to go!

380
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,930
So Brother-in-law, smile.

381
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,920
Smile!

382
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,770
- That's right, smile. 
 - Smile!

383
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,320
Mr. Jeong, what's with your face?

384
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,540
Smile!

385
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,950
And stop yelling our ears off.

386
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,370
- You were really scary. 
 - Yeah, really scary!

387
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,630
Have a drink.

388
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,430
Smile. It's nice to smile.

389
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,350
I'm scared!

390
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,910
Where are we going?

391
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,620
- Don't put down your arms. 
 - All right.

392
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,050
Okay, we're almost there.

393
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,820
All right.

394
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,820
One, two, three!

395
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
Ta-da!

396
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,100
What is all this?

397
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,250
♫  The sky is much more dazzling tonight  ♫

398
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,440
♫  Than the shining midday sun  ♫

399
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,340
♫  Sweet like a dream, sweeter than sunshine?  ♫

400
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,590
♫  I’ll dance as I fall into your eyes  ♫

401
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,280
♫  It all seems like a lie, fly in the sky  ♫

402
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,740
♫  What do I do when even the wind is so sweet?  ♫

403
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,020
♫  If I could hold your hand  ♫

404
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,600
♫  I believe I could fly anywhere  ♫

405
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,400
Su Gwang, if we could go back to the beginning,

406
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,700
would we remember

407
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,910
everything we've come across

408
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,460
and everything we liked?

409
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,010
Or would we forget them all?

410
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,810
Forget everything.

411
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,940
Try to forget everything, Seul Bi.

412
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,370
Forget all the bad things and sad things,

413
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,400
and we'll start from now on.

414
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,130
From now on?

415
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,560
♫  I believe I could fly anywhere  ♫

416
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,040
Su Gwang.

417
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,970
Yeah?

418
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,060
Gong Su Gwang!

419
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,520
What?

420
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,440
Is that a star?

421
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,970
Yeah.

422
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,390
Then I want to call that star the Gong Su Gwang Star from now on.

423
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,080
Hey, don't make stuff up like that.

424
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,120
Why?

425
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,910
That star looks like you.

426
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,320
It doesn't look like me at all.

427
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,210
It does.

428
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,960
It shines even if you look at it from afar.

429
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,330
♫  You must have known when you saw my trembling eyes  ♫

430
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,810
Su Gwang.

431
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,200
If we're separated for some reason,

432
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,250
and even if we're far apart,

433
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,360
you'll always shine like that star,

434
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,550
so I can find you.

435
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,180
♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please be with me  ♫

436
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,310
Seul Bi.

437
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,390
Yeah?

438
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,210
Do you know that actually, two stars make up that star?

439
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,130
Really?

440
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,410
♫  I don't mind flying even higher  ♫

441
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,780
They're sticking together like this, so they look like they're one.

442
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,000
♫  The road we walk alone together  ♫

443
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,800
♫  For your love, we will never be again  ♫

444
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:14,360
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

445
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:23,370
♫  Do you feel the same as I do?  ♫

446
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,270
♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please be with me  ♫

447
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,340
That's why we'll never break up.

448
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:39,800
♫  If you hold my hand, I don't mind flying even higher  ♫

449
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:48,330
♫  I'm in love, the road we walk alone together  ♫

450
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:55,380
♫  For your love, we will never be again  ♫

451
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:05,830
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

452
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:13,890
♫  Do you feel the same as I do?  ♫

453
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,150
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

454
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,160
♫  I knew it was you  ♫

455
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,280
♫  Can I smile now?  ♫

456
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:32,700
♫  Please notice my feelings  ♫

457
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,700
Did you know?

458
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,570
That even if it weren't for my abilities,

459
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,710
you'd still have made Geumhwa Group what it is now.

460
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,990
You, the man I chose, were that kind of man to begin with.

461
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,660
You just weren't aware of it.

462
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,770
Fortunately,

463
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,080
I still have a little bit of power left in me.

464
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,180
So I want to use

465
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,460
the last of my power for us.

466
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,560
So, Honey,

467
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,020
at least once, please

468
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,980
leave me with

469
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,640
a happy memory.

470
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,590
Mi Su?

471
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,880
Mi Su?

472
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,910
Mi Su?

473
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,480
Mi Su? Mi Su?

474
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,990
Mi Su!

475
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,150
Mi Su!

476
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,240
Mi Su!

477
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,700
Mi Su.

478
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,180
Mom!

479
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,370
Hello?

480
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,690
Hi!

481
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,000
Seon Dong Sik?

482
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,550
Bingo.

483
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,860
Did you miss me?

484
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,000
The police will find you.

485
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,790
Police?

486
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,350
I've become friendly with the police thanks to someone.

487
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,260
 It turns out you played me well.

488
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,030
 So I also contemplated what I should

489
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,980
 do with you.

490
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,240
Should I kill you

491
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,440
or just sell you off somewhere?

492
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,250
But I also like playing with you.

493
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,040
You like playing with me, too, right?

494
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,710
Turn yourself in.

495
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,770
Then you can find forgiveness for the things you've done.

496
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,330
 Hey!

497
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,860
I said I'll play hard with you.

498
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,240
 You like playing with me, too.

499
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Take a guess, female shaman.

500
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,380
What might I do from now on?

501
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,370
Take a guess.

502
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,420
What do you want?

503
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,900
You.

504
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,370
What?

505
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,040
You. I'm talking about you.

506
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,600
 I'm going to have you.

507
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:04,010
You'll come to me on your own.

508
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,930
Yeah, Su Gwang.

509
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,120
I have a favor to ask, Hyeong.

510
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,170
Sure, let's do that.

511
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,190
Do what?

512
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,440
My cell phone's pattern is

513
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,170
my heart which sings for you.

514
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,280
Oh my gosh!

515
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,570
Give me a freaking break.

516
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,640
Whoa!

517
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,850
This is pretty sexy.

518
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,420
Good job.

519
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,090
You did very well, Manager Yeom.

520
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,320
Hey, gambler!

521
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,480
You came!

522
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,540
Thank you for calling us, Director.

523
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,800
I'll do my best.

524
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,270
Misery loves company, you know.

525
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,640
You and I both have nowhere to go.

526
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,930
But Director, CEO Wang and Pi Tae Sik released their people

527
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,330
and are looking for you.

528
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,490
Really?

529
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,420
You found that out already?

530
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,820
You're really good.

531
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,170
Good job.

532
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,970
You've done very well.

533
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,700
What? Are you upset?

534
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,950
No.

535
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,070
Get rid of that frown, you a**hole.

536
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,700
Bring it here.

537
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,520
Ta-da!

538
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,950
Why would this be in your trunk?

539
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,440
Whose money is this?

540
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,130
I felt this a while ago,

541
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,820
but you're quite slow.

542
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,270
You're slow with fetching me information.

543
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,270
You were also too f**king slow with catching CEO Choi,

544
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,260
so CEO Wang did it instead.

545
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,690
Look at you now, too.

546
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,030
If you were going to run away, you should've done so sooner.

547
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,900
Were you planning on saying goodbye to me or something?

548
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,900
You're too slow.

549
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,630
Director, please save me this once.

550
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,430
Th-That psychotic son of a b*tch.

551
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,800
Okay, let's get this party started.

552
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,820
I presented to all the groups that participated in the bidding for the sale of the Geumhwa Group

553
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:59,160
the stable employment succession for all employees as a mandatory requirement.

554
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,690
Good.

555
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,170

I'm going to turn myself in.

556
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,370
 Let's meet at the hotel coffee shop tonight.

557
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,980
 Please come alone.

558
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,840
Okay, okay, okay.

559
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,770
Hyeongnim, I found Seon Dong Sik.

560
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,950
He's at Yoosong Corporation.

561
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,060
That abandoned warehouse? He's there?

562
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,890
Yeah.

563
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,730
Sh*t, why didn't I think of that place?

564
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,090
Yes?

565
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,340
How may I help you—

566
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,970
Did Seon Dong Sik send you?

567
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,670
That a**hole's at Yoosong Corporation, isn't he?

568
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,520
Take him away.

569
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,360
Come here.

570
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,640
It hurts. It hurts.

571
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,860
I'll go. I'll go on my own.

572
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,510
Honey!

573
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,110
Oh my, Seul Bi!

574
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,580
- Seul Bi. 
 - Seul Bi!

575
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,640
This place is so grand.

576
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,170
You stayed in the rooftop place when you had a wonderful house like this?

577
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,230
The house is so avante garde.

578
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,840
It's so nice,

579
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,920
but the creepy atmosphere is like a shaman—

580
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,820
Why is it so nice?

581
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,220
It's noblesse oblige!

582
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,990
The rooftop is high!

583
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,500
And this house is high, too!

584
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,770
You have such a high-class taste, Seul Bi!

585
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,000
What happened?

586
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,660
Su Gwang gave us the invitations

587
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,870
and threatened to kill us if we didn't come.

588
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,440
Geez, when did I say that, Mr. Park?

589
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,860
What? Yes, you did!

590
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,040
You gave us these invitations while shooting lasers from your eyes.

591
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,820
You shot lasers at me, too.

592
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,960
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

593
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,980
Seul Bi Noona!

594
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,610
I want to hurry and take a tour of Seul Bi Noona's house.

595
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,080
- Me, too! 
 - Yeah! Show us.

596
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,280
Thank you all for coming here.

597
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,240
Welcome to Seul Bi's house!

598
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,350
- Oh my! 
 - Oh my.

599
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,680
It's a garden!

600
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,430
- Oh my. 
 - What is this?

601
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,450
It's a jungle. A jungle.

602
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,840
- Daebak. 
 - I feel like Tarzan will appear.

603
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,430
It's a library!

604
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,810
- Oh my, this is so fancy. 
 - If I lose my way, I'll get lost here.

605
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,550
- Seul Bi. 
 - Yeah?

606
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,750
I'm going to step out for some work.

607
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,960
Right now?

608
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,150
Sorry. I'll be back soon.

609
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,550
Okay.

610
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,320
Seul Bi! Come here!

611
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,820
What in the world is this? Huh?

612
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,900
I'll see you later.

613
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,020
Wow!

614
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,590
Let's elegantly raise our glasses.

615
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,860
Sure, let's do this elegantly.

616
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,240
Elegance.

617
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,120
Seul Bi.

618
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,490
We're so sorry about what we did at the market.

619
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,260
If you get old like us, you do nothing but worry.

620
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,330
You could look at a plastic bag floating along the road,

621
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,180
and you'll worry about it flying onto your face.

622
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,950
- Right? 
 - What are you saying?

623
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,960
- No? 
 - Pass.

624
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,470
You had a tough time because of the negative comments on the internet, didn't you?

625
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,020
It's all right, Eonni.

626
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,190
I don't look on the internet.

627
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,780
Wow, as expected.

628
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,580
Our Seul Bi is truly wise.

629
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,340
I quit the internet, too.

630
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,980
Because it'll only make me frustrated.

631
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,070
Weird people just run their mouths. Shut it!

632
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,130
No matter how strange the world is,

633
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,520
we're on Seul Bi's side!

634
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,770
That's right. That's right.

635
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,960
We're on Seul Bi's side.

636
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,570
Seul Bi Noona, you're perfect.

637
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,250
Yeong Wu, don't you have another word instead of perfect?

638
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,140
Seul Bi Noona,

639
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,960
you're more perfect.

640
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,170
Everyone is more, more, more perfect.

641
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,520
Thank you!

642
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,880
But did Su Gwang go somewhere?

643
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,530
He invited us over, but I don't see him anywhere.

644
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,140
He works for a huge corporation.

645
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,560
He must be busy.

646
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,000
Then how about

647
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,010
we all take a commemorative photo together?

648
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,500
- Let's take one. 
 - Sounds good!

649
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,160
Aigoo. What commemorative photo? So tacky.

650
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,280
Are we here on tour?

651
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,670
Gosh.

652
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,010
- Here. 
 - Aigoo.

653
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,930
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

654
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,690
- Yes, yes. 
 - Hurry, hurry.

655
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,920
Excuse me.

656
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,490
Pretty lady, please take a photo of us.

657
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,980
Thank you.

658
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Stick together. Stick together.

659
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,310
- It's behind you. Turn around. 
 - Yes, I should turn around.

660
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,020
Okay.

661
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,470
Everyone, elegantly.

662
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,470
- Elegance. 
 - One, two, three!

663
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,150
If it's those, we'll be able to move him.

664
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,810

I just feel nervous about turning myself in.

665
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,190
 Please wait for me a little longer, Su Gwang.

666
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,290
Hey, Seul Bi.

667
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,330
When are you coming, Su Gwang?

668
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,470
 I'm sorry.

669
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,780
There's a lot of work, so it'll take longer than I expected.

670
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,280
Are you having fun with everyone?

671
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,120
Yeah, it's fun.

672
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,130
Don't worry and take your time with work.

673
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,370
All right.

674
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,080
Let me know if you need anything.

675
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,310
Okay.

676
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,880
So cute!

677
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,720
It's perfect!

678
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,040
We are so perfect!

679
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,770
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

680
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,990
 Now, where do you think the bomb is?

681
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,860
What are you doing?

682
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,550
Where is it?

683
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,320
I'll give you one hour.

684
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,330
No.

685
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,930
Fifty-nine minutes and 11 seconds, 10 seconds, 9 seconds...

686
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,940
If you just come to me,

687
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,070
the bomb won't go off.

688
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,310
 But you know you need to come alone, right?

689
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,310
If...

690
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,900
If you tell anyone,

691
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,300
the bomb will go boom!

692
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,960
Stop it.

693
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,710
I won't let you do this.

694
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,700
How? Will you curse me or something?

695
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,910
Oh yeah, I have some people you'd love to hear from.

696
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,490
- Stop! 
 - Please!

697
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,180
Please spare us.

698
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,020
Please save me.

699
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,640
 Please save us.

700
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,950
Let the people go.

701
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,060
Well, you need to come for me to do that.

702
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,480
Hurry up and come.

703
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,190
Let's play.

704
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:41,960
What the?

705
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,070
Gosh, those petty guys. They all went home already.

706
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,480
Gosh.

707
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,890
No loyalty at all.

708
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,190
Why is it vibrating here?

709
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,300
Aigoo. So clumsy.

710
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,060
Leaving the phone here, gosh.

711
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,410
Aigoo.

712
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,900
What is this? It's recording.

713
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,150
A heart.

714
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,480
 What brings you here—

715
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,990
 Lend me your ear real quick.

716
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,760
 If Pi Tae Sik and I are taken,

717
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,830
 call Gong Su Gwang.

718
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,420
Gong Su Gwang.

719
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,200
Gong Su Gwang, Gong Su Gwang.

720
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,460
 Su Gwang!

721
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,310
You're here, Female Shaman!

722
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,890
As expected, you never disappoint me.

723
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,160
Miss Seul Bi! It's dangerous! Run!

724
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,060
- Miss Seul Bi! 
 - It's dangerous. You need to run!

725
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,370
Are you okay?

726
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,890
I'm sorry.

727
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,800
You're going through this because of me.

728
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,530
I told you to run.

729
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,530
Miss Seul Bi, no.

730
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,800
You came all the way here for us.

731
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:34,610
Aigoo. Cry me a river, will you?

732
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,540
Since I came,

733
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,930
stop it now.

734
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,200
Let everyone go.

735
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,430
You coming here is not enough by itself.

736
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,860
We had a deal.

737
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,970
You need to become mine, right?

738
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,120
I'm going to kill you, Seon Dong Sik!

739
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,300
Shut that motherf**ker up!

740
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,620
Stop!

741
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:58,720
I'm

742
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,040
greedy for everything about you.

743
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,470
Your power

744
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,040
and your ability.

745
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,140
I want to own everything.

746
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,430
Let the people go.

747
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,960
Sh*t.

748
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,050
Hey.

749
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,020
Why do you keep repeating yourself?

750
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,680
It's not fun.

751
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,980
Also, it's not just these people here.

752
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,650
You should also save the Geumhwa Hotel folks.

753
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,950
"Please save me!"

754
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,170
Seul Bi!

755
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,710
- Seul Bi! 
 - Seul Bi!

756
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,920
- She's not here. 
 - She's not?

757
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,240
- She's not? 
 - Yeah, she's not here.

758
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,380
Where the heck did she go?

759
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,860
Where did she go?

760
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,170
"Save us, Miss Seul Bi!"

761
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,730
Why? You didn't know?

762
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,580
Hey, where do you think I want to blow up the most?

763
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,080
It's Geumhwa Hotel.

764
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,890
You monster.

765
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,130
A monster that you created.

766
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,750
Follow me.

767
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,130
Let's go somewhere nice together.

768
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,290
No.

769
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,070
Miss Seul Bi, you shouldn't.

770
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,500
You mustn't.

771
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,700
- Miss Seul Bi! 
 - Miss Seul Bi.

772
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,400
- Miss Seul Bi. 
 - No!

773
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,470
Please don't go!

774
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,070
- She's not here. 
 - Just where did she go?

775
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,230
So strange.

776
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,140
Su Gwang, Seul Bi isn't at the hotel.

777
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,270
What?

778
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,730
I'm not sure when she left.

779
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,800
Seon Dong Sik.

780
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,390
Now. To celebrate you becoming my woman.

781
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,010
Cheers.

782
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,870
I'm going to make it go "boom."

783
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,380
Don't do this. Please.

784
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,610
You can stop even now.

785
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,280
Cheers.

786
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,820
Good job.

787
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,370
I have a question.

788
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:49,470
How did you stop the time bomb from last time?

789
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:53,440
Can you stop the one at Geumhwa Hotel from this far, too?

790
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,050
Please.

791
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,190
Stop it.

792
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,020
You're really getting on my nerves.

793
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,990
Let's just have fun.

794
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,040
You like playing with me.

795
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,260
Or is there something else you want to do with me?

796
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,230
Huh?

797
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,020
You want to know

798
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,530
how I'll stop the time bomb?

799
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:20,920
What?

800
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,890
 There's a time bomb in the hotel boiler room.

801
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,300
Move right now.

802
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,240
Okay, understood.

803
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,480
Give these to the chief, please.

804
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,730
If he doesn't move even after seeing these, tell him he'll have to join me in here.

805
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,210
Yes, understood.

806
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,340
Run!

807
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:34,060
 The Citizen's Reliable Police Who Are With the People

808
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,700
You're really something else, huh?

809
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,220
So great.

810
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,360
You're really great.

811
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,340
I need to make you mine.

812
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,870
I really want you.

813
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,790
Let go.

814
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,830
- I said to let go— 
 - Stay still!

815
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,380
Seul Bi!

816
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,370
Seul Bi!

817
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,350
No.

818
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,450
No, Su Gwang.

819
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,030
Don't come, Su Gwang.

820
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,580
You can't.

821
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:02,040
Seul Bi!

822
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,660
Okay.

823
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,790
Seul Bi!

824
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,620
Su Gwang!

825
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,450
Seul Bi!

826
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,430
- Su Gwang! 
 - Seul Bi!

827
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:20,250
- No, don't come closer! 
 - Seul Bi—

828
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,450
Su Gwang, go back!

829
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,740
It's that bastard again?

830
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,770
I was going to send him off along with Geumhwa Hotel.

831
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,340
What do I do? Su Gwang!

832
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,800
Let me go!

833
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,870
Seul Bi!

834
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,370
You're Inspector General Park from the Northern District Prosecutors' Office, right?

835
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,730
This is Seon Min Joon of Geumhwa Group.

836
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,720
H-Hyungnim.

837
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,540
You scumbags!

838
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,990
 I'll infiltrate them and wait for your order.

839
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:36,120
 - I'll be counting on you. 
 - Please rest assured.

840
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,140
 I have a favor to ask.

841
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,170
 I need you to get caught by Seon Dong Sik.

842
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:55,100
 We'll need to do that if we want to locate him and rescue Ms. Min.

843
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,900
Hyung, I'll go to Seul Bi.

844
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,030
Yeah, hurry up and go!

845
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,610
You piece of—

846
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,370
Seul Bi!

847
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:41,020
- Seul Bi! Seul Bi! 
 - Gong Su Gwang, stop right there!

848
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,310
Or I'll shoot her.

849
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,440
Stop it, Seon Dong Sik.

850
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,370
The police are on their way.

851
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:55,100
Let's stop now.

852
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,450
It's this witch.

853
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,140
I said, it's this witch!

854
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,440
This witch is the one who made me like this!

855
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,370
Nobody made you like that.

856
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:10,650
You're the one who caused yourself to be like that.

857
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:16,590
If you stop now, we can still turn everything back.

858
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,790
Stay there.

859
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,830
Stay there!

860
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,650
Cut the bullsh*t!

861
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,780
What do you mean turn everything back?

862
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,610
I'll never get caught.

863
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:28,870
Dong Sik.

864
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,040
Let's put that down and talk, okay?

865
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:35,810
Dong Sik.

866
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,290
I said, don't come any closer!

867
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,840
I'm the one who caused you to be this way?

868
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,930
Fine.

869
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:11,180
I'm the one who turned you into a monster.

870
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,150
So I'll make sure to stop you.

871
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:23,310
We're both monsters, Seon Dong Sik.

872
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:28,310
Let's disappear together.

873
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,370
Seul Bi, no.

874
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:42,860
Stop it, Seul Bi.

875
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,550
Seul Bi!

876
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:47,540
Seul Bi, stop it. Don't!

877
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:21,180
Seul Bi.

878
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,070
Seul Bi.

879
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,540
Are you okay?

880
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,430
Seul Bi.

881
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,370
Su Gwang.

882
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,460
I'm so glad.

883
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,800
I'm so glad, Seul Bi.

884
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,120
What did I...

885
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,770
What did I do?

886
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,210
What do you mean? Nothing happened.

887
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,700
It's fine, Seul Bi.

888
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,810
It's all over.

889
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,080
It's okay, Seul Bi.

890
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,890
No.

891
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,900
No, Su Gwang.

892
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,400
Su Gwang! No!

893
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,350
No!

894
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:40,000
♫  On a sunny day with the warm light, suddenly  ♫

895
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,430
Su Gwang.

896
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:44,140
No. Please!

897
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,300
Please come back.

898
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:55,200
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

899
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,710
Su Gwang, come back!

900
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,400
Come back!

901
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,410
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

902
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:12,990
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

903
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:21,720
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

904
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:28,950
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

905
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:36,930
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

906
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:40,980
 Jinxed at First

907
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,190
 Here! Here! Over here! Here! Here!

908
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,870
 It's all my fault.

909
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,060
 It's all my fault.

910
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,810
 It's a package for you, Director.

911
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,000
 There's no sender's name on it.

912
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,880
 If I had run away with you back then, how would we have ended up?

913
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,860
 I'm sorry, Seul Bi.

914
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:02,290
 Because I couldn't protect you.

915
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:04,370
 I'm sorry, Seul Bi.

916
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:11,050
