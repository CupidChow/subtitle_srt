00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,820
 Episode 12

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,490
Chairman Seon Il Jung made a shareholder proposal to appoint

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,070
three non-executive directors he has recommended at the

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,080
regular shareholders' meeting next month.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,870
The terms of the three current non-executive directors expire this time around.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,600
The board of directors should refuse.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,550
Chairman Seon Il Jung has already filed an injunction with the court,

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,610
so we'll have to accept it.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,370
Put the matter on the table.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,670
It's been Hyeongnim's long-cherished wish.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,880
I'll finish it

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,640
at the shareholders' meeting without hesitation.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,530
We will try to bring in as many to our side

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,490
as possible before the next shareholders' meeting.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,510
Were you able to look into that person?

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,950
They don't want to meet with either side.

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,920
They don't want to get involved in this kind of conflict.

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,780
I heard Uncle wanted to have a fight at the shareholders' meeting.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,200
Sam Joong, that punk, must be brimming with confidence.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,150
Do you know how many of the stakes I've secured?

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,510
I need something impressive to make sure he falls flat on his back.

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,570
Should I go to the shaman and see if we'll be able to take over Geumhwa?

23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,030
Don't make a fuss and go around making trouble needlessly.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,770
Chairman, I've brought him.

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,110
You're here?

26
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,840
I'll greet you formally, Chairman.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,210
I'm Wang Yoon Ho.

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,960
Yes.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,450
I've been fond of Geoseong Private Loans

30
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,000
for a long time.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,340
Yes, Chairman.

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,920
How is it being a CEO?

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,720
It's a heavy responsibility.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,400
- I'll do my best. 
 - Sure.

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,500
I need someone to take CEO Choi's place

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,970
to take care of rough jobs without making a big fuss.

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,430
Can you do that?

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,110
You have my pledge.

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,280
Then find CEO Choi, who's hiding like some rat's a**,

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,010
and bring him in front of me!

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,190
Yes, Chairman.

42
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,390
You look reliable.

43
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,270
You're my father, but you're so pitiful.

44
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,410
Being threatened by a bastard like CEO Choi.

45
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,940
You punk!

46
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,000
What do you know to say sh*t like that?

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,660
You think I don't know?

48
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,470
You're my father, but

49
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,100
is that something a human can do?

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,110
Hang in there, CEO Wang.

51
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,200
Yes.

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,490

53
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,380

Don't worry. It's progressing well.

54
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,870
 This is our boss.

55
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,240
 Wow, this geezer went this far?

56
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,670
 Do you know where this man is right now, Hyeong?

57
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,230
 No, he disappeared, so Eunsung Capital also seems to be looking for him.

58
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,750
 We must find him first.

59
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,280
 I'll cover you so that Eunsung can't find him.

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,380
 Be careful, Hyeong

61
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,120
 Mi Su!

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,380
 Put the gun down. Put the gun down, Mi Su!

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,540
 No. That person must die.

64
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,160
 I'm going to kill him with my own hands!

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,760
 - No. 
 - No!

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,180
Mi Su.

67
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,900
I'll take Ms. Mi Su and bring her back safely.

68
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,180
Sure.

69
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,390
Go on.

70
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,960
Mom.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,050
Mom.

72
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,850
Mom.

73
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,820
Mom.

74
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,110
I'm sorry, Mom.

75
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,880
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,640
Mi Su,

77
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,280
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,310
Mi Su.

79
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,910
Your mom would not have wanted you to be in pain like this.

80
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,340
Aunt?

81
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,360
Mom.

82
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,780
For the past 22 years, I couldn't come outside.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,570
I had trapped myself.

84
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,010
I trapped myself

85
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,140
to pay the price for the sins I've committed.

86
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,640
Mi Su.

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,230
But that consequence

88
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,840
is being passed on to the children.

89
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,350
Children who are innocent.

90
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,220
How can I break this endless chain?

91
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,770
How did you undo this curse?

92
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,450
Listen carefully, Mi Su.

93
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,990
If you want to save Seul Bi, you must do this.

94
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,830
Geumhwa Group is a castle built upon female shamans' powers.

95
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,610
And there are layers upon layers of misfortune within.

96
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,220
Seul Bi is being held there to eliminate all that misfortune.

97
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,020
If you want to save Seul Bi,

98
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,160
you must completely take down that castle called Geumhwa Group.

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,210
Completely take down?

100
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,150
And...

101
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,400
And it's cruel to say so, but

102
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,780
if it's for these children,

103
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,110
you must cut this chain.

104
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,710
I'll carry everything with me.

105
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,270
Absolutely everything.

106
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,060
I'll carry it all with me.

107
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,050
It's not something you can do alone.

108
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,090
I didn't know what you'd like, so I prepared a couple of things.

109
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,700
Is there anything uncomfortable for you?

110
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,410
No.

111
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,740
 Add hydrangeas to the bouquet.

112
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,970
Excuse me. Please add hydrangeas to the bouquet, too.

113
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,610
Sure.

114
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,010
What brings you here, Jang Gyeong?

115
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,670
I'm sorry I couldn't come more often while studying abroad, Ajumma.

116
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,740
These are my mom's favorite flowers.

117
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,750
When I was younger, Ajumma gifted me a hairpin.

118
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,470
I still have it.

119
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,210
This one.

120
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,170
You're so funny.

121
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,680
You're even remarkable when you smile, my main character.

122
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,440
Ajumma, you must be happy

123
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,840
that you have such a fantastic son like him.

124
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Did you remember that my mom liked hydrangeas?

125
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,250
Huh?

126
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,330
Yeah.

127
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,160
Thank you, Jang Gyeong.

128
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,420
 Seonghwa Hospital

129
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,280
Aigoo. Sh*t!

130
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,050
"It's here. It's here."

131
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,910
That "it's here" of his!

132
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,180
Gosh.

133
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,460
I mean, if his eldest son came to visit him,

134
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,620
he should get it together and think of what he could give him.

135
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,330
Aigoo, my head! Aigoo.

136
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,720
Aigoo, it's here.

137
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,630
The headache is here.

138
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,650
I think it's better for you to do what you originally planned.

139
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,390
Yes. You're right.

140
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,370
The hidden card should be used at a time like this.

141
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,600
It's a pleasure to see you again.

142
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,230
Does Chairman Seon Il Jung know that you're doing this?

143
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,480
Our household affairs are none of your concern.

144
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,550
I packed a thick envelope today as well.

145
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,840
What is it that you want me to see?

146
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Hey. My father is going to take over Geumhwa Group.

147
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,840
Then what will fall into my hands?

148
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,170
No.

149
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,350
About when can I inherit everything?

150
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,290
Gosh. I don't like that because it smells like ethanol.

151
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,690
Then what kind of smell do you like?

152
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,640
- The smell of fish? 
 - Yeah.

153
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,520
What a unique taste you have.

154
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,300
The smell of fish, the smell of chicken,

155
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,370
the smell of kkwabaegi,

156
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,640
and the smell of jeon (Korean pancake) being fried in the side dish shop.

157
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,370
I hate it.

158
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,190
The smell of a mixture of foods.

159
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,530
It's so weird.

160
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,520
What? What is?

161
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,090
- There's a weird smell coming from you. 
 - Huh?

162
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,430
Like a smell of iron.

163
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,110
Hey, do you know how expensive this cologne is?

164
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,120
The one I sprayed on today.

165
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,290
Do you want a better whiff?

166
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,790
Here.

167
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,870
When will I be able to inherit Geumhwa Group?

168
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,340
What the? What are you doing?

169
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,820
Now that I think about it,

170
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,640
I think I can get a lot more money from Chairman Seon Il Jung.

171
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,310
I'm going to manage my condition.

172
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,460
Wow. You really like money.

173
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,670
- He's contacting me. 
 - Huh?

174
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,310
Chairman Seon Il Jung.

175
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,820
Father?

176
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,820
Yes, Chairman.

177
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,770
You need to keep spots like this clean.

178
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,410
It's fine.

179
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,250
Why did you leave this bill here?

180
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,650
Oh gosh! Look at this. Look at this. So dirty.

181
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,830
That ajumma has been completely blinded by love.

182
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,960
Ajussi, my mom eats two bowls of rice for every meal.

183
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,790
How pleasant.

184
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,140
Pleasant?

185
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,300
You should hear her yelling

186
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,200
and see if she's still pleasant!

187
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,310
That's right.

188
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,600
The noise of a train is 90 decibels,

189
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,870
but it's 100 decibels if my mom screams.

190
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,310
It surprises the hell out of me sometimes!

191
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,830
But for me, she's so...

192
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,360
Hyeon Tae.

193
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,100
I put the bill in the first drawer.

194
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,010
Look at you. Look at you.

195
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,440
- What? 
 - We're done for. We're done for.

196
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,580
But Mr. Jeong and Mrs. Bang strangely look good together.

197
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,100
You're spouting nonsense again.

198
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,760
Hey! Hey!

199
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,540
Those shoulders! The fit of that suit!

200
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,330
Look at that brilliant radiance!

201
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,550
Brother-in-law!

202
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,210
- Oh my gosh. 
 - He's so cool!

203
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,910
I almost couldn't recognize you after joining a corporation.

204
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,980
Has everyone been doing well?

205
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,300
The market is lonesome without Su Gwang and Seul Bi.

206
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,060
You should bring Seul Bi, too.

207
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,600
Is our Seul Bi doing well?

208
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,430
Brother-in-law, you need to treat her well.

209
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,690
So did you join them to become their live-in son-in-law?

210
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,070
- Excuse me? 
 - Yes, tell us all about it.

211
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,770
If Seul Bi is really Geumhwa Group's daughter.

212
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,350
Mr. Jeong won't say anything!

213
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,140
I looked it up, and it seems they don't have a daughter.

214
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,470
Ajussi, there's somewhere you need to go with me.

215
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,650
- Where? 
 - Come on.

216
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,150
I'm sorry. We have something to do, so we'll get going.

217
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,510
Huh? Where are you going?

218
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,590
Leaving already?

219
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,670
Corporate employees usually have a lot to do.

220
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,730
They're busy.

221
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,690
My husband Jeong Tae is like that, too.

222
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,550
I see.

223
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,310
But who will look after the shop?

224
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,350
If you don't play, you lose. Rock, paper, scissors!

225
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,170
Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors!

226
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,820
Welcome!

227
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,230
Two kilograms of cutlassfish for 28,000 won.

228
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,090
Why are we home?

229
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,530
Mi Su.

230
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,540
Can I hold your hand?

231
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,620
Mi Su.

232
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,230
You've been through a lot for a long time.

233
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,990
Mi Su!

234
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,690
I'm sorry. I am.

235
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,690
For planning to betray you,

236
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,620
for doing the same thing to Seul Bi!

237
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm sorry!

238
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,210
I'm the one who's sorry.

239
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,550
I'm so sorry.

240
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,530
What about our Seul Bi?

241
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,110
Is she doing well?

242
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,940
Jeong Hyeon Tae,

243
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,620
listen carefully to what I say from now on.

244
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,770
The hypnosis I put you in 20 years ago...

245
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,640
I'll remove it now.

246
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,360
This child is your daughter.

247
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,300
You love me.

248
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,360
Take me and run away.

249
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,640
Seul Bi is not your daughter.

250
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,580
 She's your daughter.

251
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,920
 You love me.

252
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,000
We never loved each other.

253
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,950
 Take me and run away.

254
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,340
 You ran away with me because I hypnotized you.

255
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,410
There was nothing going on between us.

256
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,060
She says Seul Bi is not my daughter.

257
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:52,120
Ajussi, Geumhwa Group will hire a lawyer to petition for a retrial for you.

258
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,370
Geumhwa Group will do its best to explain

259
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,000
that you were wrongly accused.

260
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,380
No amount of money will be enough,

261
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,790
but they'll compensate you as best they can.

262
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,740
Seul Bi...

263
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,890
I probably won't be able to see her now, right?

264
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,200
Ajussi.

265
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,950
This is something Ms. Mi Su gave you.

266
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,240
 It's not me. There's someone else's fortune you must tell.

267
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,260
Su Gwang.

268
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,590
Seul Bi made a promise to Seon Il Jung because of me.

269
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,440
A promise to tell someone's fortune.

270
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,120
Secretary Cha.

271
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,870
Secretary Cha, I'm telling the truth.

272
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,530
Miss Seul Bi went to meet Chairman Seon Il Jung,

273
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,240
- but she insisted she would go alone— 
 - Does that make sense?

274
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,100
When did you start stealing information from us and expose it to Eunsung?

275
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,030
No, I didn't. I really didn't!

276
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,800
You were prepared for this when you set your mind to do this over a few bucks, right?

277
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,110
Secretary Cha. Secretary Cha.

278
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,960
You lost quite a lot from your online gambling at an overseas casino.

279
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,370
Okay, you like gambling, so I'll send you there.

280
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,540
The people at the casino to whom you owe will swarm to you.

281
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,080
The guys there seem pretty rough around the edges.

282
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,400
Secretary Cha, please don't.

283
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm going to die then.

284
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,090
Please save me.

285
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,330
Don't come anywhere near here from now on.

286
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,310
Don't say a word about what you've seen here.

287
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,590
I understand.

288
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,670
I won't ever come near here again.

289
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,790
What did you say?

290
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,060
In the end, Seon Il Jung, that geezer—

291
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll go to Eunsung Capital and bring Miss Seul Bi back immediately.

292
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,490
It's not there.

293
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,560
What the?

294
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,990
This is the place they came to without me?

295
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,620
I wonder why.

296
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,870
Meet him and take a look at his future.

297
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,610
Whom he'll meet, what they'll talk about,

298
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,530
if he holds any hidden shares,

299
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,020
and when he'll die.

300
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,880
Why is it so quiet?

301
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,690
Is he dead?

302
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,290
Sh*t.

303
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,910
Don't come. Don't come.

304
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,960
Don't come.

305
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,990
Ok Jin.

306
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,200
Ok Jin.

307
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,360
Look at my future, Ok Jin.

308
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,300
Yes, do you see something?

309
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,850
What do you see?

310
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,200
She will place me at the top of this world.

311
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,800
Father! What top of the world?

312
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,990
Your eldest son should regain possession of Geumhwa.

313
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,530
If that's to happen,

314
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,460
think about if you held any hidden shares

315
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,740
or what the content of your will is.

316
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,520
Think hard about it.

317
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,160
How is it?

318
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,210
What do you see, huh?

319
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,280
Let me go, Ok Jin.

320
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,170
Let me go.

321
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,770
Let me go, please.

322
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,370
Ok Jin, please, let me go.

323
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,280
Ok Jin?

324
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,650
Who's Ok Jin?

325
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,630
Your descendant will come.

326
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,130
The curse that you've been trapped in all your life...

327
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,850
That person will take it.

328
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,890
Aigoo! That curse again!

329
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,220
All that talk about a curse again!

330
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,400
Hey! Tell me about something you saw for real! Not some curse!

331
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,830
Meet with Eun Ok Jin, executive director of the Youngjin Foundation.

332
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,610
Eun Ok Jin?

333
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,640
That person will give you what she has.

334
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,610
Seon Il Jung!

335
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,730
Seon Il Jung?

336
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,640
Do you have no respect for your elders now?

337
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,470
Does the whole world seem like it's under your feet?

338
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,450
Listen carefully.

339
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,820
Just because I've been holding back until now,

340
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,150
don't think that means I'll continue to do so.

341
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,200
There will be no more mercy from now on.

342
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,070
Mercy?

343
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,100
Mercy is something you extend to the homeless.

344
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,880
How long do you think I'll sit back and observe your impudence?

345
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,820
It'll no longer be observation.

346
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,370
Prepare yourself to handle the consequences.

347
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,410
This punk.

348
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,580
Father!

349
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,360
Father! Father!

350
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,670
Your eldest son lives with this kind of treatment.

351
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,090
Father. Father, listen to what I have to say.

352
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,440
- Father! 
 - Let's go.

353
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,580
Can you hear me?

354
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,050
Father! Get it together!

355
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,010
Father!

356
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,290
Hey! Hey, you punk!

357
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,960
Is that female shaman more important to you than our blood relations?

358
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,250
Youngjin Foundation Director, Eun Ok Jin. Look into her immediately.

359
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,550
All right.

360
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,740
Will you tell me what happened there?

361
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,730
 You can't tell anyone about

362
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,630
 what you see and hear here.

363
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,070
 The day you open your mouth,

364
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,540
 your father, Assistant Jeong, will disappear with the wind.

365
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,310
I won't force you to.

366
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:44,220
I won't let Seon Il Jung mess with you ever again.

367
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,970
Why?

368
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,850
Why would you do that?

369
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,380
You and Chairman Seon Il Jung are one and the same to me.

370
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,020
Seul Bi.

371
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,590
You said you'd never let anyone mess with me again.

372
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,440
Then there's something you need to know.

373
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,370
I see a news report.

374
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:59,260
The U.S. SIG. Their assets will be frozen.

375
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,900
Chairman Seon Il Jung has been buying a stake in Geumhwa Group with investments collected by

376
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,060
organizing private equity funds since 2017.

377
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,070
But he was giving money to previous investors

378
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,040
with the money he got from new investors.

379
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,260
It's kind of a fund reversal.

380
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,370
How predictable of Hyeongnim.

381
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,410
It's a shallow investment scam.

382
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,370
Who is closest to Hyeongnim from the Financial Supervisory Service?

383
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,730
It's Director Lee.

384
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,870
He said he's available for a meeting tonight.

385
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,410
However, do you think Director Lee will switch sides that easily?

386
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,900
I'll have to give him something that can drive

387
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,660
even the closest relationship apart.

388
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,860
SIG U.S. Financial Investment Corporation. This is an investment contract.

389
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,090
We were going to invest with them a while ago, but we put it on hold.

390
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,450
Seon Il Jung will invest in them.

391
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,410
Seul Bi!

392
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,660
What happened?

393
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,460
Are you okay?

394
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,450
It's you.

395
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,150
You're that child.

396
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,210
Seul Bi.

397
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,260
The child

398
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,460
who will take away my curse.

399
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,320
The child

400
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,910
who will take the curse in my place.

401
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:12,000
♫  On a sunny day with the warm light, suddenly  ♫

402
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:26,000
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

403
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,990
Su Gwang.

404
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:34,400
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

405
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,990
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

406
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,370
 The child who will take away my curse.

407
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,060
 The child

408
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,400
 who will take the curse in my place.

409
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,450
Are you okay now?

410
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,790
Yeah.

411
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:33,500
Let's go meet with Great Aunt tomorrow.

412
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,620
Director Eun Ok Jin?

413
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,570
We must meet her tomorrow.

414
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,110
Why?

415
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,650
You're trying so hard.

416
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,330
What is it all for?

417
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,990
Seul Bi?

418
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,210
I can't bear to see you

419
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,450
suffering and being sick like this.

420
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,900
There

421
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,190
was a time when

422
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,530
I knew the future, but I couldn't do anything about it.

423
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,390
Even though I could see the future,

424
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,440
it was something I couldn't change.

425
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,040
So

426
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,060
no matter how hard I tried,

427
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,440
I couldn't prevent it from happening.

428
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,940
I couldn't do anything about it.

429
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,450
That day two years ago,

430
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,890
I hated myself for not being able

431
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,810
to do anything for you.

432
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,360
No, Seul Bi.

433
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,860
I'm sorry.

434
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,340
I'm sorry for saying what I said to you.

435
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,100
It's not your fault.

436
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,800
It's not your fault, Seul Bi.

437
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,090
I'm not telling you never to take them off.

438
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,070
I'm just saying, for me,

439
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,910
the person who cares for you the most in this world.

440
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,850
At least, for me...

441
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,150
don't take them off recklessly.

442
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,570
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

443
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,530
♫  I knew it was you  ♫

444
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:22,400
♫  You must have known when you saw my trembling eyes  ♫

445
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,640
♫  Please notice me  ♫

446
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,630
♫  I'll smile a little more  ♫

447
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,800
♫  I'll look at you a little longer  ♫

448
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,500
♫  Please notice my feelings for you  ♫

449
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:48,450
♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please be with me  ♫

450
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:56,990
♫  If you hold my hand, I don't mind flying even higher  ♫

451
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,500
♫  I'm in love, the road we walk alone together  ♫

452
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:14,000
♫  For your love, we will never be again  ♫

453
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:23,000
♫  Do you feel the same as I do?  ♫

454
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,190
Su Gwang, have a seat as well.

455
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,630
It's all right.

456
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,000
I have to go meet Secretary Cha.

457
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,700
When you meet Secretary Cha,

458
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,290
- make sure to get the documents.
 - Documents?

459
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,980
The investment contract.

460
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,280
Su Gwang will be responsible for that job.

461
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,300
That sounds good.

462
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,800
All right.

463
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,440
Now, let's dig in.

464
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,780
You don't need to visit the hospital?

465
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,810
It was hard and shocking for you yesterday, huh?

466
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,230
I'm fine now.

467
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,820
What happened when you met with Grandfather yesterday?

468
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,610
I'll tell you later.

469
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,220
I'm glad you're back safely.

470
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,710
You know how to say things like that now?

471
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,100
Make sure to go with Secretary Gong when you go out.

472
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,920
And

473
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,360
use this when you need it.

474
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,520
"A card for everyone."

475
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,880
I can use this as I please?

476
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,440
Yes.

477
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,690
It seems like your wedding preparations with Jang Gyeong are going well.

478
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,280
Go on and eat.

479
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,730
Secretary Cha.

480
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,270
Yes, Secretary Gong.

481
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,120
Chairman asked me to give this to you.

482
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,520
It's an investment contract.

483
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,050
We must make Chairman Seon Il Jung invest in this company.

484
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,890
To do that, we need an ally to approach Seon Il Jung and pretend to be his friend.

485
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,750
You said you know someone like that?

486
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,180
I think I do.

487
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,120
Nice to meet you, Director.

488
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,040
It's been a while.

489
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,680
You died.

490
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,340
We were twins. My older sister and I.

491
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,310
That's right. That's right. You were twins!

492
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:54,350
Oh my gosh, it's just that you two look exactly the same.

493
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:59,070
Then the Director of the Youngjin Foundation, who can flip

494
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:03,240
the political and business world with one word is a female shaman?

495
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,340
Aigoo.

496
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,910
I've disrespected you, Director.

497
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,170
How have you been all this time?

498
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,140
Why did you come looking for me?

499
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,950
I have nothing left but a financial relationship with Geumhwa Group now.

500
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,880
Do decades of resentment

501
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,680
fade away so easily?

502
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,800
What is it that you want?

503
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,870
I'll be blunt with you.

504
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,200
I must regain possession of Geumhwa.

505
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,030
Please lend me some of your power.

506
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,700
Why should I do that?

507
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,060
You're part of the Seon Family as well.

508
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,170
Well, it's because

509
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,690
you probably resent Sam Joong down to your bones.

510
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,520
The female shamans were trapped by Sam Joong.

511
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,980
I mean, the mother and daughter

512
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,000
are your blood relatives.

513
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,440
Am I wrong?

514
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,470
If you could just turn your share to our side,

515
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,160
then I'll retake Geumhwa

516
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,420
and those poor female shamans—

517
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,630
I mean, that mother and daughter.

518
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,090
I'll make sure to free them.

519
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,890
Fine.

520
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,570
As expected, you're straight to the point!

521
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,670
I have one condition.

522
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,950
What's this?

523
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,220
Isn't this an investment contract from SIG, an American

524
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,910
financial investment company?

525
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,030
How much cash does

526
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,320
Eunsung Capital currently have?

527
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,880
That's...

528
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,700
Please invest in SIG with my stake in

529
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,890
Geumhwa Group as collateral.

530
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:11,230
It's a bit big in scale,

531
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,890
but it's about 60 billion won.

532
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,730
With that money, I would rather buy shares of Geumhwa Group.

533
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,320
The shares you purchase now

534
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,640
will not give you the right to vote at the general shareholders' meeting.

535
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,970
That's true.

536
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,020
So you're saying you'll vote yourself?

537
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,140
You just have to raise your hand

538
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,320
for us at the shareholders' meeting.

539
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,980
Thank you!

540
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:12,200
What will happen now if Seon Il Jung sends the investment to SIG?

541
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,470
U.S. SIG's

542
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,870
assets will be frozen.

543
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,590
Seon Il Jung's funds will hit rock bottom.

544
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,230
Yes.

545
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,840
At that time, if fund investors

546
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,480
demand that Seon Il Jung return the investment funds immediately,

547
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,920
Seon Il Jung will have no choice but to sell his shares in Geumhwa Group.

548
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,480
Will he sell?

549
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,110
Or else

550
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,470
he'll go to prison.

551
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,190
But as long as Seon Sam Joong occupies Geumhwa Group,

552
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,090
you won't be free, Seul Bi.

553
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,240
Geumhwa Group

554
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,490
will collapse.

555
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,980
You've

556
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,380
already seen everything.

557
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,420
You poor thing.

558
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,050
I'm sorry I wasn't able to get you out of there sooner.

559
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,870
You have such big wings.

560
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,550
You must use them to fly high now.

561
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,190
It's so delicious.

562
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,130
I wonder why Seul Bi asked us all to gather.

563
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,550
Exactly.

564
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,010
But

565
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,710
if you look at the news reports these days,

566
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,900
Geumhwa Group is noisy.

567
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,000
Seul Bi's company? Why? Because of what?

568
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,240
A dispute over management rights or something. There's a fight between brothers.

569
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,660
The second son, not the eldest son, inherited the company,

570
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,280
but the eldest son is trying to take it back.

571
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,080
But what I don't understand is

572
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,640
if Seul Bi is the daughter of one of those people,

573
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,180
who exactly is Mr. Jeong?

574
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,950
I heard from Mr. Jeong

575
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,840
that he's not Seul Bi's father.

576
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,130
- Oh my! 
 - What?

577
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,130
She's not even his real daughter, but that's what he believed for 20 years?

578
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,350
I knew that was the case. You can tell just by one look.

579
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,110
They don't look alike at all.

580
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,290
Don't they look alike?

581
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:23,020
She's pretty, and he's handsome.

582
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,040
- They look the same. 
 - There she goes again.

583
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,530
She's absolutely blinded.

584
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,910
So that's why our Hyeon Tae looked so down

585
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:31,780
and closed the shop early.

586
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,620
- Goodbye. 
 - Yes, take care.

587
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,590
Welcome.

588
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,060
Oh, Su Gwang.

589
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,560
Everyone's here, right?

590
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,530
Yes, they're all upstairs.

591
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,100
You two look good together.

592
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,060
Thank you!

593
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,630
Let's go, Seul Bi.

594
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,220
Fine. I'm changing my dating philosophy now.

595
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,260
It's no longer straight ahead, no looking back.

596
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,770
It's straight ahead, overtake!

597
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,880
No looking back ever again.

598
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,810
Please give me a ride in this car, Eun Joong.

599
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,720
Gosh, what are you doing? Gosh.

600
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,030
Why not?

601
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,630
Wow!

602
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,420
- One glass of beer, please. 
 - Okay, thank you.

603
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,400
- We're here. 
 - Hey, you're here!

604
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,410
- Seul Bi, welcome. Welcome. 
 - Have a seat.

605
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,440
Have a seat.

606
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,660
You've gotten prettier!

607
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,220
The fish shop is closed already?

608
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,330
Mr. Jeong looks so down lately.

609
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,200
He closed up early and went home.

610
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,540
But Seul Bi,

611
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,680
there's something I'm curious about.

612
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,200
What's your relationship with Mr. Jeong then?

613
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,460
So tired of that question. Stop it for God's sake.

614
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,430
Then a different question!

615
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,910
How much is a chaebol's fortune? 
  (TN: Chaebol -  A family who owns a conglomeration, a tycoon)

616
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,120
Don't do this, Mr. Park.

617
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,940
Oppa, you honestly don't know?

618
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,080
You can probably fill the entire 63 Building with fish boxes full of cash.

619
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,830
Exactly!

620
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,790
A trillion?

621
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,650
- Ten trillion? 
 - Trillion?

622
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,120
Trillion? That sounds like "Jo," meaning chicken.

623
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,310
How many chickens must we sell to touch that kind of money?

624
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,700
That's not funny.

625
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,840
Su Gwang went to a place like that as the future live-in son-in-law?

626
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,540
He's so lucky!

627
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,770
Cut it out now. Cut it out.

628
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,570
Everyone,

629
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,080
I have a—

630
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,530
Favor to ask?

631
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,660
You have a favor to ask, don't you?

632
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,550
Go ahead! Ask! I'll do anything!

633
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,920
Ask.

634
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,340
Why are you all so happy about this?

635
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,050
When you ask for a favor, good things happen.

636
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,300
That's right. That's right. Ask way.

637
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,030
- Ask away. 
 - Ask away.

638
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,990
Please ask away.

639
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,540
Seul Bi, don't worry about anything.

640
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,380
We'll take care of it without a hitch.

641
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,320
Bye now!

642
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,870
- Don't worry! 
 - Bye!

643
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,520
We don't need anything.

644
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,840
Hurry and go.

645
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,230
Gather, gather around.

646
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,950
Okay.

647
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,510
What do you mean coronation?

648
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,470
Come on now.

649
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:53,660
When the shareholders make their decisions,

650
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,730
- I'll meet you then. 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

651
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,570
- What do you mean, congratulations? 
 - Yes.

652
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,380
- Thank you. 
 - Let's grab a drink sometime. Yeah.

653
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,160
What? Min Joon?

654
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,640
He'll just be pushed aside now.

655
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,960
Okay, take care!

656
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,770
Hey! Hey!

657
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,190
Are you the one taking over Geumhwa Group?

658
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,450
You're getting all the congratulations.

659
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:16,290
Father, my friend wants me to find him a position as team leader of an affiliate.

660
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,490
You punk, have you gone crazy?

661
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,400
- Get out. 
 - Father.

662
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,970
I can't even do this much?

663
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,110
I'm this company's managing director.

664
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,080
Did you send the investment funds?

665
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,880
Don't worry. I sent them over right away.

666
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,920
It's game over even before the start of the shareholders' meeting, Father.

667
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,310
All those bastards who looked down on me...

668
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,020
"Please take good care of me."

669
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,460
"Please find me a position as a boss at an affiliate."

670
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,690
What flattery.

671
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,260
This is the power of money!

672
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,890
Sons of b*tches.

673
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:56,300
 Art Director, Eun Ok Jin

674
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,520
 Seon Il Jung: SIG investment completed

675
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,300
Chairman,

676
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,560
Seon Il Joon made his investment in SIG.

677
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,280
Chairman,

678
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,010
U.S. SIG assets have been frozen due to defaulting.

679
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,240
 SIG, which marked a considerable growth, is facing a scandal due to its funds...

680
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,750
 I see a news report.

681
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,500
 U.S. SIG.

682
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,980
 Their assets will be frozen.

683
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:46,450
Contact the big players who invested in Seon Il Jung's

684
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,290
private equity fund.

685
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,710
All right.

686
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,610
Let's start asking for the redemption of the investment.

687
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,160
What?

688
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,220
What did you say?

689
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,180
What do you mean their assets were frozen?

690
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,450
What does that mean?

691
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,020
Hello?

692
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,710
Okay, hang up for now.

693
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,720
Father, what's going on?

694
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,610
Manager Yeom!

695
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,060
We'll find out on our end and let you know.

696
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,420
Hey. What the hell is going on?

697
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,990
There was a sudden rush of requests from fund investors for repurchase,

698
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,930
- so banks and securities firms asked about our funds— 
 - No, no, no!

699
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,210
Then we can just return their investments!

700
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,250
All of the funds are held in the US SIG.

701
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,290
It's true!

702
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:38,250
Father, SIG assets had been frozen.

703
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,880
What in the world is going on?

704
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,080
Sh*t!

705
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,860
How could this happen?

706
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,470
How could this happen?

707
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:56,330
Why won't you pick up? Aigoo, seriously.

708
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,550
Director!

709
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:05,140
Well, well? What is going on?

710
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,910
I heard that SIG assets have been frozen,

711
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:11,390
so what happens to my money?

712
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,290
Why would money be a problem?

713
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:18,740
Don't I just have to stand by you at the shareholders' meeting?

714
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,220
That's true, but

715
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,430
I need that money right now.

716
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,670
If you need money right away,

717
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,610
go look for it somewhere else.

718
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,540
Director! But still—

719
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,670
If you were going to take over Geumhwa with just 60 billion won,

720
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,390
you should've been prepared to handle this much!

721
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,010
You greedy human, you're stupid as well!

722
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,840
Wait. Wait, Director!

723
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,700
Hello? Hello?

724
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:04,550
 Meet with Eun Ok Jin, executive director of the Youngjin Foundation.

725
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,360
Hey.

726
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,540
That female shaman.

727
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,010
That female shaman child!

728
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:16,790
That treacherous b*tch dares to screw me over?

729
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,240
Bring that b*tch here immediately!

730
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,900
How can we bring her? She's in Geumhwa Hotel!

731
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,300
Shut up, you bastard!

732
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,950
At least go and bring Assistant Jeong!

733
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,270
She dares to mess with me?

734
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,670
F**k.

735
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,010
Oh my. Oppas!

736
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,540
You're here to buy suits? Suits...

737
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,740
Where's Jeong Hyeon Tae?

738
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,930
Huh? 
  Pay up! Give me back my money!

739
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,700
What the? Who are you? 
  Pay up! Give me back my money!

740
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,910
Are you looking for Jeong Hyeon Tae? Do you know Jeong Hyeon Tae?

741
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,640
- Where the hell is Jeong Hyeon Tae? 
 - Excuse me. Excuse me!

742
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,700
I'm the head of this market.

743
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,330
If you all barge in like this, the merchants will be anxious.

744
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,850
Where is Jeong Hyeon Tae

745
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,510
who works at this shop?

746
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,320
Jeong Hyeon Tae.

747
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,830
Oh! That bastard Mr. Jeong?

748
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:15,250
Jeong Hyeon Tae took all the merchants' money and ran off!

749
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,940
Oh, for God's sake!

750
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,600
Hey, you. Aren't you on the same side as Jeong Hyeon Tae?

751
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,130
It's a little strange now that I think about it.

752
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,840
We saw this person there.

753
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,670
Don't you remember from the Geoseong Private Loans office?

754
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,740
- Huh? Oh my. He is! 
 - Isn't he?

755
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,800
Oh my. I'm the mackerel ajumma? Don't you remember?

756
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,910
That son of a b*tch stole all my money!

757
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,390
- Please find him for me! 
 - I have a lot to say too.

758
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,140
Please find him. That's your specialty.

759
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,090
- Professionals! 
 - My money. My money.

760
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,960
- My money. 
 - We've been cheated by him, too.

761
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,810
Please find our money for us, Ajussi.

762
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:45,860
I lost the most.

763
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,100
I can't do this. Let's all report this to the police together.

764
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,430
- Report this to the police. Report him! 
 - That's right.

765
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,820
- Jeong Hyeon Tae! 
 - Oh my, oh my.

766
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:58,660
Have you found my Hyeon Tae? My Hyeon Tae...

767
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,410
Please find my Hyeon Tae.

768
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,180
- Aigoo. 
 - I don't need my home title or money.

769
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,520
Please just tell him to come back to me!

770
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,600
- Eonni, don't do this. 
 - Please find my Hyeon Tae.

771
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,080
- Aigoo! 
 - Eonni, don't be like this.

772
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,580
- Please! 
 - Oppa!

773
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,190
Please!

774
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,380
Find me my money!

775
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,800
It was perfect.

776
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,330
We took care of this perfectly, just as Seul Bi asked us to.

777
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,150
There's nothing we can't do for Seul Bi.

778
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,030
Oh my, Mrs. Bang was born to act.

779
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,570
Why does he keep calling?

780
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,770
Geez! What is this? Huh?

781
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,780
- We've been robbed of our money. 
 - F**k!

782
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,540
I'm going to kill them.

783
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,050
Those b*tches.

784
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:00,740
That female shaman, that treacherous b*tch.

785
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,820
And her father, too. I'm going to kill them all!

786
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,510
Chairman.

787
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:10,940
Assistant Jeong has disappeared.

788
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:17,100
Get out! Get out!

789
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,990
Who are all of you?

790
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,970
We're from the Seoul Northern District Prosecutors' Office, Criminal Division 6.

791
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,040
Prosecutors?

792
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,820
Why would the prosecution do a search and seizure on us?

793
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,000
Northern District Prosecutors' Office?

794
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,440
Blocking funds, investment fraud,

795
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,340
manipulating internal stock information.

796
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,070
The Financial Supervisory Service has indicted you.

797
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,940
Why are you using such difficult words? Put it simply, punk!

798
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:41,380
To sum it up, it means we're f**ked, Father.

799
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,730
You little—

800
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,620
- Move! 
 - Geez!

801
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,510
Hold on.

802
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,840
Director Lee?

803
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,330
I'm Seon Il Jung from Eunsung.

804
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,520
Director Lee! Hello?

805
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,300
Vice Minister Kim, this is Seon Il Jung.

806
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,240
If you do not comply with the summons without a justifiable reason,

807
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,380
we can conduct a forced investigation, so please cooperate.

808
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,990
- Father. Father? 
 - Chairman.

809
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,500
Chairman!

810
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,000
- My blood pressure. 
 - Father!

811
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,480
- Chairman! 
 - Father!

812
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,590
Father. Father, what's wrong?

813
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:41,580
Father!

814
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,750
- Chairman! 
 - Father!

815
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,490
- Chairman. 
 - Father.

816
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,040
Ambulance. Ambulance.

817
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,400
Call for an ambulance! Call an ambulance!

818
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,680
- I said to call 911, you bastards! 
 - Ambulance!

819
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,390
Father! Father!

820
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,570
Hurry up and call!

821
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,940
 Eunsung Capital

822
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,180
- What's going on? What happened? 
 - Please move aside.

823
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,510
Chairman!

824
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,220
Chairman, are you okay?

825
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:09,320
The game has unfolded, so it's your move now, Director Lee.

826
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,310
Yes, thank you.

827
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,730
It's all done, Chairman.

828
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:19,100
We've defended Geumhwa.

829
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,770
In this case, the shareholders

830
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:25,650
will also reject all non-executive directors recommended by Seon Il Jung.

831
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,700
Good job, Secretary Gong.

832
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:09,680
Thank you for saving me from that bastard, Seon Il Jung.

833
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,190
Dad.

834
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,600
Dad?

835
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,810
You know I'm not your dad.

836
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,970
I just wanted to call you that once.

837
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,550
You've been my motivation for the past 20 years.

838
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:38,060
For 20 years, I thought,

839
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:42,400
"I have a daughter."

840
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,590
"I have a daughter I must meet once I get out of here."

841
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,770
"How pretty she must be."

842
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:58,330
"How beautiful she must be."

843
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,400
I endured each day with those thoughts.

844
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:12,670
Thank you for letting me be your dad all this time.

845
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:31,450
Ajussi,

846
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:33,720
you will get a wife

847
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,530
and you'll also have children.

848
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:40,720
You'll have a very harmonious family.

849
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,830
What wife and kids at this age?

850
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,640
But since you're telling me that, I feel like it'll come true.

851
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:15,990

852
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:22,610
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

853
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,330
♫  Can't we start our love?  ♫

854
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:30,600
♫  The only place for my weary heart to rest  ♫

855
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,410
♫  It's in your arms  ♫

856
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:37,610
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

857
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:41,780
♫  Can't I embrace you?  ♫

858
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:46,980
♫  Even if I get hurt or in pain  ♫

859
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,890
♫  I'll love you  ♫

860
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,670
 Jinxed at First

861
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:54,100
 Seul Bi, if you saw Min Joon's future,

862
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:59,290
 and you still choose to stay by Min Joon's side, I'm sure there's a good reason for that.

863
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,440
 The curse doesn't just disappear.

864
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,180
 It doesn't disappear but transfers to someone else?

865
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,210
 Through bloodline, from generation to generation.

866
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:08,690
 I've released all our people, so we'll hear from them soon.

867
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:11,300
 You must bring them to me alive.

868
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,480
 I always felt sorry for my mom.

869
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,320
 But now, I'm more pitiful.

870
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,380
♫  Only you  ♫
