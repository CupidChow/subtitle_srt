1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,410
Why are you following me? 
  Episode 4

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,230
Just don't do anything and stay home.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,040
No!

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,230
Hi, Eun Su.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,470
Hi, Noona.

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,720
Oh, I'm the one who said 40,000 won.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,150
Oh, I see.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,310
By the way, you are so pretty, Noona.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,220
Are you nuts?

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,330
You're slacking off.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,710
Aren't you going to school?

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,570
I'm going.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,430
Excuse me.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,620

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,520
It's yummy.

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,920
Myeong Seong and I have known each other for over a year.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,560
I've been scolded by my mom for over a year

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,150
as I've watched the unlucky events that happen every time I talk...

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,640
No, I mean, we've been overcoming the ordeal of love

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,050
- as I got to know Myeong Seong. 
 - This is really yummy.

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,420
What's this called?

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,580
It's written there.

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,030
"The deep and strong taste of life."

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,510
People said she's a little slow...

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,530
Is it true?

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,120
Anyway,

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,510
what I was going to say is Myeong Seongâ€”

28
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,890
You are a good person, Eun Jeong.

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,860
Excuse me?

30
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,080
You shared this delicious drink with me,

31
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,690
and you didn't even ask me for money.

32
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,470
No, just...

33
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,750
It's just a can of coffee.

34
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,720
It's not just a can of coffee.

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,970
It's "the deep and strong taste of life" coffee.

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,610
Hey.

37
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,890
Are you okay with staying next to Myeong Seong?

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,490
He's not Myeong Seong. He's Su Gwang.

39
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,850
I guess that's just the nickname you call him.

40
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,590
Anyway, when you get involved with him,

41
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,560
unlucky things happen.

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,270
It'd be better for you to stay away from Myeong Seong.

43
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,580
But why do you keep talking to Su Gwang?

44
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,940
Because I like him.

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,220
Su Gwang likes me though.

46
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,350
On the first day I met Myeong Seong, I was...

47
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,610
 - Hey, where are you going? 
 - Excuse me.

48
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,890
 We have a spare room in my house. By any chance, are you looking for a room?

49
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,230
 Are you crazy? Do you want to get in trouble with Mom?

50
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,060
 Yes, I'm looking for a room.

51
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,200
 And on the second day when I met him...

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,070
 Excuse me.

53
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,320
 I'd like to have one fried chicken to go, please.

54
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,920
 Excuse me?

55
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,210
 What should I do?

56
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,260
 - Oh no! 
 - It's dangerous! Stay away!

57
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,170
In that situation, he quickly took out my cell phone.

58
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,200
He's so awesome.

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,790
There's someone else who likes you.

60
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,100
Nearby.

61
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,600
What?

62
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,280
Oh, I drank it all.

63
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,700
Eun Jeong, where are you?

64
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,590
Oh. Yeah?

65
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,030
Where did you go?

66
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,120
Mom, I'm sad.

67
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,240
Why are you sad?

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,290
She said she's Myeong Seong's girlfriend.

69
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,660
She's neither his younger sister nor older sister.

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,770
Oh, gosh. Everyone in the neighborhood knows that.

71
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,110
Did you just find that out?

72
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,570
I'm boiling with anger.

73
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,690
If you fry several chickens, you'll feel better.

74
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,630
What do you mean?

75
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,570
When I boil with anger,

76
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,640
watching the oil boil makes me calm down.

77
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,310
That's what I do when I'm upset about you guys.

78
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,570
Just go fry some chickens.

79
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,880
What in the world, Miss?

80
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Please go to the Lucky Fish Shop.

81
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,770
Do you think this is a taxi or something?

82
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,960
I have cash.

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,050
Ta-da!

84
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,980
Su Gwang gave me this for lunch.

85
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,760
Here you go.

86
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,460
Since it's on the way anyway, it works.

87
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,070
Mom!

88
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,710
Why are you driving this woman?

89
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,970
Why not?

90
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,030
Hey, 10,000 won doesn't grow on trees.

91
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,200
And we should say hello to each other as neighbors.

92
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,950
Oh, right, hello.

93
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,130
Hello!

94
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,830
Mom, are you rubbing salt in my wound?

95
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,830
I'm driving a wedge to make you give up on Myeong Seong.

96
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,980
He has neither money nor connections.

97
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,460
If you're not going to live off of his good looks, you shouldn't live with a guy like that.

98
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,450
Mom!

99
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,630
Ajumma!

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,300
Don't talk badly about my Su Gwang!

101
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,770
Aigoo, look at them going nuts. Seriously.

102
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,390
What's with her?

103
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,390
Does she have another man besides Myeong Seong?

104
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,450
There's no one who doesn't know that man in Seodong Market.

105
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,550
What in the world is going on?

106
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,610
Why am I the only one in the dark?

107
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,100
- Min Joon. 
 - Did you know that Su Gwang

108
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,210
was alive?

109
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,740
Yes.

110
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,480
That's why you left?

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,970
I won't go back.

112
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,500
What I said about letting you live in the outside world someday was

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,940
my true intention.

114
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,840
I'll stay next to Su Gwang.

115
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,400
If my father finds out you are here, Su Gwang will be in danger.

116
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,190
You don't want that to happen, do you?

117
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,580
Don't worry. I'll stop it.

118
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,500
So, after you get some fresh air,

119
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,180
please come back.

120
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,000
You'll come back, right?

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,670
Pick one, pick one, pick one.

122
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,500
Pick one, pick one, pick one.

123
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,970
Pick, pick, pick, pick. One, one, one, one.

124
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,520
Seul Bi, pick one, pick one, pick one.

125
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,270
Are you angry?

126
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,640
Hello, Seul Bi.

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,340
Hey!

128
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,490
I told you not to come!

129
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,980
No!

130
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,930
I'll go wherever I want to go.

131
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,400
Yes, yes.

132
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,810
Do whatever you want.

133
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,640
I'll be right back. Just don't cause any trouble.

134
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,200
Give me this one. Scorpaenif something and

135
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,330
- atka mackerel something? 
 - Yes.

136
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,500
Su Gwang, give her two atka mackerels,

137
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,210
oceanic fish belonging to the scorpaeniformes hexagrammidae family.

138
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,110
Oh, okay. Two atka mackerels? Okay.

139
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,020
Pick one, pick one, pick one.

140
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,580
Pick one, pick one, pick one, pick one.

141
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,910
Pick one, pick one, pick one, pick one.

142
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,530
Miss, over here.

143
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,820
- Two cutlassfish. 
 - Yes.

144
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,600
Su Gwang, that oppa wants two cutlassfish,

145
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,700
oceanic fish belonging to the perciformes trichiuridae family.

146
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,880
Why are you so careless?

147
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,200
Who the hell is it?

148
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,710
Who took my customers?

149
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,880
Hey, unlucky Go Myeong Seong!

150
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,130
Who the hell are you to take away all my regulars?

151
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,870
Look, they are all my regular customers.

152
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,370
This eonni, too.

153
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,380
This oppaâ€” I took good care of you. You shouldn't be like that!

154
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,260
President Paâ€” Oppa, why are you here?

155
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,400
This is my building.

156
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,890
Sh*t, what about you, Mr. Hong?

157
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,900
- Because I'm also an oppa. 
 - Sh*t.

158
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,590
Are there different customers for different stores?

159
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,750
You can't take a customer from that store?

160
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,950
No, there's no such rule.

161
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,540
Is that so?

162
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,450
Ajumma, who are you to yell at my Su Gwang?

163
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,900
Su Gwang? Who the hell is Su Gwang?

164
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,760
Go Myeong Seong! You, Go Myeong Seong!

165
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,110
Are you Su Gwang?

166
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,210
I'm not sure...

167
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,770
Who the heck are you?

168
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,740
Why are you confusing me?

169
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,050
And who are you?

170
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,050
Are you his wife or what?

171
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,090
W-Wife?

172
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,430
She's a nobody.

173
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,930
The wife means this, right?

174
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,510
A word for a woman you married.

175
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,600
Yes, that's right.

176
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,520
I'm indeed his wife.

177
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,810
What are you going to do about it?

178
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,630
Hey, hey. When did we get married?

179
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,840
That's okay. We will get married in the future.

180
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,280
Be quiet!

181
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,350
I don't care whether you fall forward or backward!

182
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,850
In this Seodong Market, we have a thing called business ethics.

183
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,450
I've been doing business over there for five years.

184
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,770
One day out of the blue, he opened up a fish shop within 50 meters of my store.

185
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,120
He took away all my regulars. This is cheating!

186
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,430
Am I wrong?

187
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,950
- Is there such a rule? 
 - No.

188
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,020
At Seodong Market Fish Market,

189
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,120
the fish shops are lined up one meter apart.

190
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,880
He's saying there's no such rule!

191
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,090
Ajumma, don't bother us. Go away!

192
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,410
You go away!

193
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,860
Where did this tiny little rat come from and go nuts all over the place?

194
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,230
How dare you yell at me!

195
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,650
Su Gwang.

196
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,220
I think I'm going to have to fight with this Ajumma.

197
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,880
I will protect my Su Gwang.

198
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,000
President Park!

199
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,550
What did she bring?

200
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,040
I should catch this dung fly.

201
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
- Hey, hey! 
 - Aigoo.

202
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
- Seul Bi! 
 - Aigoo!

203
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,760
Do you think you can catch me with this dung fly swatter?

204
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,940
Do you think I'm scared?

205
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,860
Cat.

206
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,570
Does ajussi raise a cat?

207
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,640
What the heck... You...

208
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,740
You...

209
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,190
What are you guys looking at?

210
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,650
Get out of my way.

211
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,340
If you take away my regulars one more time,

212
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,950
I'll make you pay for it.

213
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,820
That stubborn ajumma went away!

214
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,340
You're amazing, Seul Bi!

215
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,700
Coming right up.

216
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,520
Yes, Jang Geun, it's been a while.

217
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,900
Hey, Seon Min Joon.

218
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,740
Did you forget something?

219
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,750
What?

220
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,980
 Hey, who's my younger sister?

221
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,430
Jo Jang Gyeong. Your fiancÃ©e, dude.

222
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,330
She recently came back to Korea.

223
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,300
But I heard you haven't even called her yet.

224
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,700
Oh, right.

225
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
I've been busy at work.

226
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,650
Listen, if you don't surprise Jang Gyeong on her birthday,

227
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,910
you'll lose favor with my mom, your future mother-in-law. Got it?

228
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,970
Got it.

229
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,550
You know when Jang Gyeong's birthday is, don't you?

230
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,270
 See? I knew it. I knew it.

231
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,420
 It's tomorrow.

232
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,020
It's tomorrow, man.

233
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,490
Don't make mistakes.

234
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,410
All right.

235
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,180
You're so pretty, Jang Gyeong.

236
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,200
Thank you!

237
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,690
Look at this guy. Speak of the devil, and he appears, they say.

238
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,510
Here he is.

239
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,350
Oppa.

240
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,380
Oh, I heard you were back in the country.

241
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,040
Chairman Seon, that's how he greets his fiancÃ©e after two years.

242
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,490
He was going to visit you first,

243
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,270
but he must be surprised to see you show up so suddenly.

244
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,370
Really?

245
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,590
Did I miss a chance for him to surprise me?

246
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,220
I know it's your birthday tomorrow.

247
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,970
You remembered my birthday?

248
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,380
You don't have any other plans tomorrow, do you?

249
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,580
Even if I do, I should cancel them all.

250
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,870
Did you miss me?

251
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,790
Please call off the engagement.

252
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,590
How can I lie to Jang Gyeong about Seul Bi for the rest of my life?

253
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,650
You don't have to lie because you just won't tell her.

254
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,880
That's nonsense.

255
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,770
How do I hide a person for the rest of our lives?

256
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,380
That child is your talisman.

257
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,400
A talisman is...

258
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,210
something that you hide from others.

259
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,200
Seul Bi is a person. How come she is a talisman?

260
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,700
How can I lock her away for her entire life?

261
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,480
What you are doing right now is a crime.

262
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,070
A heinous crime.

263
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,130
You've...

264
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,360
never seen a monster, have you?

265
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,320
The longer

266
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,900
she's out there,

267
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,600
the more monstrous that child will become.

268
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,880
Please stop.

269
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,630
Back then...

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
Why did you do that back then?

271
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,140
Why didn't you just kill me then?

272
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,880
My Seul Bi...

273
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,460
Please don't look for her.

274
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,720
Please let go of my Seul Bi now.

275
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,510
Please. I'm begging you.

276
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,470
Please don't look for my Seul Bi.

277
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,040
Please don't look for my Seul Bi.

278
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,910
Mr. Wang.

279
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,460
Yes.

280
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,120
Mr. Wang!

281
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,600
Oh, what brings you here, Miss Seul Bi?

282
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,880
I have a favor to ask you.

283
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,890
If you put it in here,

284
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,950
the letter will be sent to that address.

285
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,550
- Thank you, Mr. Wang. 
 - No problem.

286
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,420
 What is this?

287
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,600
 Seul Bi.

288
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,890
 If you get out of here, send a letter to this address.

289
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,720
 A letter?

290
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,640
 Establishment of law and order for human respect - Correctional Services

291
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,400
Mr. Jeong Hyeon Tae?

292
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,620
You are Mr. Jeong Hyeon Tae, right?

293
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,190
I'm number 2514.

294
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,260
I mean...

295
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,910
I am Jeong Hyeon Tae.

296
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,320
Yes, it's me.

297
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,600
I didn't expect someone to wait for me.

298
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,800
By the way, who are you?

299
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,190
S-Seon... 
  Chairman Seon Il Jung

300
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,570
Why? Why?

301
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,820
What do you want me to do?

302
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,440
It's been 20 years already!

303
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,990
He will contact you again soon.

304
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,350
 Chairman Seon Il Jung

305
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,590
- Ajumma, one more bottle of soju, please. 
 - Okay.

306
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,150
How's my Mi Su doing?

307
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,760
How about my daughter?

308
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,430
She must be all grown up.

309
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,390
 Hey.

310
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,410
 Miss Mi Su.

311
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,490
F-Father?

312
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:12,720
It will come to us...

313
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,380
- Father. 
 - It will...

314
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,710
- Father. 
 - It will come to us...

315
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,520
Father.

316
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,170
Father.

317
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,720
Are you okay, Father?

318
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,100
Where did you go earlier?

319
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,720
It's a secret.

320
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,940
What secret...

321
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,610
Take your time and eat a lot.

322
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,230
I'm good at selling, huh?

323
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,170
Just don't cause any trouble.

324
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,060
I'll let you make a lot of money, Su Gwang.

325
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,690
Hey, aren't you younger than me though?

326
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,150
Why do you speak informally to me and call me by my name?

327
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,750
Then what should I call you?

328
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,480
A man who is older but not a brother is...

329
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,720
Ajussi!

330
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,840
Hey, how do I look like an ajussi?

331
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,440
Then... oppa?

332
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,800
Hey. Just call me S-Su Gwang.

333
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,750
Su Gwang is good. I like it.

334
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,350
I got it.

335
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,850
Prince.

336
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,730
Don't.

337
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,720
- Prince. 
 - Don't.

338
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,580
- Prince. 
 - Don't do that!

339
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,370
- Why not? Prince! Prince! 
 - Don't do that!

340
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,600
Prince!

341
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,770
- I don't want to hear that. 
 - Why?

342
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,010
- I'll do it, too, then. 
 - Prince.

343
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,540
- Princess. 
 - Yes, Prince?

344
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,840
- Please! 
 - Prince.

345
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,770
- Please don't. 
 - Prince.

346
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,290
Pick one, pick one, pick one. 
  Lucky Fish Shop

347
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,000
Mollusk squids, belonging to the Cephalopoda Decapoda family.

348
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,540
They are fresh! Fresh!

349
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,000
- Please buy some squid. Squid. 
 - No, no, no.

350
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,310
- Squid. 
 - No, no, I don't want to.

351
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,120
 Lucky Fish Shop

352
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,700
Wow, where are all the customers who came by yesterday?

353
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,960
Don't you know where they went?

354
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,210
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

355
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,100
- They were taken to the hospital! 
 - What?

356
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,300
Yesterday, someone who bought fish from here ended up at the hospital for food poisoning.

357
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,510
Ended up at the hospital? Who?

358
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,370
I don't know who, but...

359
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,900
Ms. Smile said so.

360
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,890
The rumor is all over the market.

361
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,290
That ajumma is lying!

362
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,460
Really. That ajumma is too much.

363
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,790
I'm going to make that ajumma apologize to us

364
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,450
so she won't lie ever again.

365
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,950
Whoa, whoa!

366
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,700
No. She's not the type to apologize.

367
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,840
She has a temper and is a social butterfly.

368
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,150
If you fight with her, we might get kicked out of here.

369
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,490
Myeong Seong is right about that.

370
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,450
Don't even think about fighting with Ms. Smile.

371
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,510
I've never seen Ms. Smile smile.

372
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,020
But why is she Ms. Smile?

373
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,860
She's always ready to fight. "Oppa, Oppa!"

374
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,260
Geez!

375
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,930
Oh, right. Myeong Seong.

376
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,640
The Fisheries Center said they need a delivery man today.

377
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,800
Can you come for a minute?

378
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,870
Yes, our business is slow today anyway.

379
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,540
Please wait a minute.

380
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,160
Seul Bi, I'll be right back.

381
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,670
Just stay here, okay?

382
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,330
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

383
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,680
Jang Gyeong, I have something to tell you.

384
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,820
What is it?

385
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,260
- Let's call off our engaâ€” 
 - Oh no!

386
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,410
Gosh, I forgot to take a picture.

387
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,740
I should've taken one before I ate it.

388
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,860
You didn't start eating yours yet. I'll take a picture of yours.

389
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,190
What were you going to say?

390
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,340
Let's call off our engagement.

391
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,790
Okay.

392
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,880
Okay?

393
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,110
To be honest, I got engaged two years ago because my mom said so.

394
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,810
But there's no such a thing these days.

395
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,230
We've never even been in a proper relationship.

396
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm sorry to say this on your birthday.

397
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,440
The real surprise was this, not your gift.

398
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,260
The worst experience in my life.

399
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,970
No.

400
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,020
Can it be the best experience?

401
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,600
- Best? 
 - Yeah.

402
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,310
- It's the best experience. I can add depth to my work. 
 - Work?

403
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,900
I've been publishing a series of novels here lately.

404
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,690
It's a fantasy novel about the secrets of a chaebol family.

405
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,850
You went to study abroad after dropping out of medical school,

406
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,340
- and you were you doing this? 
 - Yeah.

407
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,570
I'm a pretty successful writer.

408
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,900
So there's a condition for calling off our engagement.

409
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,760
Let's keep our breakup a secret for now

410
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,860
and meet me for an interview.

411
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,450
Interview?

412
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,910
The model for this novel is you, Oppa.

413
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,310
Hey!

414
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:28,420
It's not difficult. Just your room, your clothes, your people,

415
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,870
who you meet, and what you think.

416
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,800
Just open up your mind to me.

417
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,980
Jang Gyeong, that'd be difficult.

418
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,530
Then I won't call off our engagement.

419
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,340
You said you were sorry toward me.

420
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,190
Today's my birthday.

421
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,230
You'd do it for me, right?

422
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,890
Do you want to do an interview with me or marry me?

423
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,500
Interview.

424
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,120
Yay! Thank you, Oppa.

425
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,080
I have to go and write the next portion. See you tomorrow.

426
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,750
Thanks for the meal.

427
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,730
Bye!

428
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,440
 Lucky Fish Shop

429
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,480
 Lucky Fish Shop

430
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,880
Su Gwang.

431
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,690
What brings you here?

432
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,240
Did you come to ask me that?

433
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,350
No, I just happened to see you.

434
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,040
Have you been here before?

435
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,120
Yeah, I've been here before.

436
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,650
When?

437
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,540
- Last Wednesday? 
 - Get out of my way.

438
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,030
Hey, sister! What brings you here?

439
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,620
What present did Min Joon give you?

440
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,120
Show it to me. Where is it?

441
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,400
Where is it? I want to see what Mrs. Geumhwa Group gets.

442
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,700
Be quiet. Be quiet.

443
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,570
- Oppa. 
 - Didn't you have a friend who was a Geumhwa Group scholarship winner?

444
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,030
Wasn't he the top student from the business management major at Hanguk University?

445
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,690
Oh, you mean Su Gwang?

446
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,850
Yeah, that oppa.

447
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,920
I saw him earlier.

448
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:59,660
Hey, he died while you were abroad.

449
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,300
Yeah, I also heard that he died.

450
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,660
But it was him for real.

451
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,480
He was talking to Min Joon. They seemed serious.

452
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,530
 Min Joon, is Su Gwang alive?

453
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,190
I just happened to see him, too.

454
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,520
So why didn't he stay in touch with us?

455
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,840
Why in the world?

456
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,140
 So what's he up to?

457
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,690
 Where does he live?

458
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,430
Hey, Jang Geun, I'm busy. I'll call you later.

459
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,700
Is something the matter?

460
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,510
No.

461
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,790
You're taking good care of Jang Gyeong, right?

462
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,240
Yes.

463
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,320
Yeah, Jang Geun.

464
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,910
Gong Su Gwang?

465
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,480
What are you talking about?

466
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,240
Anyway, okay. I'm busy right now. I'll call you back later.

467
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,210
- Is this her? 
 - Who is this woman that Min Joon and Uncle are looking all over the place for her?

468
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,710
I don't know about that either.

469
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,910
You really don't know?

470
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,020
You're dead if you're trying to get more money out of me.

471
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,180
I really don't know.

472
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,090
Our search team only received this one picture, too.

473
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,210
They didn't give out any of her personal information.

474
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,360
Is she Uncle's hidden daughter for real?

475
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,190
But I know one person who might know this woman.

476
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,740
Who is it?

477
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,250
This place is...

478
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,180
 Sunghwa Hospital

479
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,640
It's been a while.

480
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,480
I'd like to thank Geumhwa Group and Eunsung Capital

481
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,450
for always taking care of us.

482
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,220
The hospital is a little spooky.

483
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,290
Is it because it's a mental hospital?

484
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,620
Director, I came here for something else today.

485
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:49,050
This room was specially ordered by Chairman Seon Sam Joong.

486
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,670
Honey, honey.

487
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,260
Honey.

488
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,520
 Room C-02

489
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,380
Excuse me.

490
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,810
Seon Dong Sik?

491
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,500
Seon Sam Joong's nephew.

492
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,620
I never imagined you would come here.

493
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:14,450
 That girl is a lucky talisman that Seon Sam Joong

494
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,260
 has prepared for his son.

495
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,740
 If you hold onto her, misfortune will go away

496
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,120
 and luck will come your way.

497
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,120
 Everything that Seon Sam Joong achieved

498
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,650
 was accomplished by that lucky talisman.

499
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,520
 That makes no sense.

500
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,860
 You can tell how much Seon Sam Joong cherishes that talisman

501
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,270
 because people who speak of that talisman

502
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,600
 all end up like me.

503
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,600
 They vanish off the face of the earth.

504
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,260
 I read them all!

505
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,000
 I've read all of these too!

506
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,950
 No, Lady Seul Bi! You can't take off your gloves!

507
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,250
 - Put your gloves on now.
 - No!

508
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,250
 - What's this? 
 - What?

509
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,720
 Ms. Min,

510
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,210
 you're stuck in a strange place.

511
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,300
 Surrounded by white walls.

512
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,900
 No, Lady Seul Bi!

513
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,730
 It's just your imagination, Lady Seul Bi.

514
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,660
 It's your imagination.

515
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,300
Min Joon.

516
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,430
- I called you. 
 - What's up?

517
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:18,430
My father said there's a good tea for people who can't fall asleep.

518
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,960
He asked me to give this to Uncle.

519
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,060
He's inside, right?

520
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,240
He's resting right now.

521
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,970
- He won't meet anyone. 
 - Really?

522
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,100
Then I should come back later.

523
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,860
Oh, right.

524
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,960
I heard about Su Gwang.

525
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,690
Where does he live now?

526
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,630
What is he up to?

527
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,900
I don't know either.

528
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,670
But...

529
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,620
since that time...

530
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,030
Uncle hasn't talked about Su Gwang at all?

531
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,360
No.

532
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,850
About Su Gwang.

533
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,770
After he met a girl here,

534
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,860
his life got messed up, right?

535
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,660
Right.

536
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,110
They said he'd be chief secretary as soon as he joined the company,

537
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,420
but they suddenly canceled the offer.

538
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,170
So? What?

539
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,510
Min Joon.

540
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,390
I heard that Geumhwa Group lost something very substantial.

541
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,150
There is no such thing.

542
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,410
Then is it a girl, not "something"?

543
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,750
If it's not that important to you,

544
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,770
can I pick it up and keep it?

545
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,200
What's wrong with you?

546
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,500
Min Joon!

547
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,050
See you later.

548
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,360
What's the matter?

549
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,680
It's nothing.

550
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,100
Look at her carefully.

551
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,250
She's the girl that our VIP is looking for.

552
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,450
There's a tremendous bounty on her,

553
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,150
so find her quickly and bring her to me.

554
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,190
It's an arthropoda crab in the Decapoda Portunidae family.

555
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,730
It's a cutlassfish, an oceanic fish in the Perciformes Trichiuridae family.

556
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,360
It's an atka mackerel, an oceanic fish in the Scorpaeniformes Hexagrammidae family.

557
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,990
Wow! Did you memorize all that?

558
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,370
You are amazing, Yeong Wu.

559
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,240
Yeong Wu, why don't you ask your mom to buy you fish?

560
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,420
Mom!

561
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,150
Yes, son.

562
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,280
Why? Is there something you want to eat?

563
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,320
Oh my. Yeong Wu's mom.

564
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,550
Are you going to buy fish there?

565
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,290
Ms. Smile said maggots came out of their fish.

566
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,590
Maggots?

567
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,830
Maggots?

568
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,650
Maggots?

569
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,500
The larva of a fly-necked insect with no bones with a vague head and feet differentiation

570
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,130
and is white, chubby, and soft.

571
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,800
That worm?

572
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Whoa! This is so wrong!

573
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,300
Hey!

574
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,010
Maggots are dirty.

575
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,350
Yeong Wu, maggots didn't come out of them. I think there's going to be a fight.

576
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,080
Yeah, it's going to be a big match.

577
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,490
Yay!

578
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,660
Yeong Wu, I'll be right back.

579
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,160
Oh, my back.

580
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,860
Aigoo, my back.

581
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,380
My back hurts so badly from standing all day.

582
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,030
Honey. You, Kim Jeong Tae!

583
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,830
Putting on quite a show, huh?

584
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,680
Where are you going with this money again?

585
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,620
Because you took all my cards,

586
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,380
I get no benefits from running my business.

587
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,840
Shut up!

588
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,790
What benefit...

589
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,990
Why do you need this much cash?

590
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,350
Are you trying to go to that cat or dog or something?

591
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,490
You should know what's going on in the world.

592
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,820
That's the trend these days.

593
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,030
- You have no idea how things are! Come on! 
 - Give it to me!

594
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,270
Where are you going?

595
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,990
Aigoo, I should beat him up with these rubber gloves!

596
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,540
Eonni, one more bottle of soju, please.

597
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,810
What the heck is wrong with you now?

598
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,800
Stop drinking! It's early afternoon!

599
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,100
If your mom finds out, you'll get kicked out!

600
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:55,100
No matter how much I look at the boiling oil,

601
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,040
I just can't calm down.

602
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,440
What?

603
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,120
Hey, what's wrong with you?

604
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,550
Cat?

605
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,650
Ajumma!

606
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,660
Why?

607
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,720
You are such a liar, Ajumma!

608
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,270
Why did you say maggots came out of our store?

609
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,740
- Forget it if they didn't. 
 - "Forget it if they didn't"?

610
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,510
Are you going to keep doing this, Ajumma?

611
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,690
Taking away customers by lying is cheating!

612
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,410
Shut up!

613
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,950
You're the one who took away all my regulars.

614
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,500
That's called healthy competition.

615
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,820
The male peacocks compete fairly to look good to the female peacocks,

616
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,410
and that's how they got to have such beautiful feathers.

617
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,530
If you work hard and develop in competition,

618
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,350
you become more beautiful.

619
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,020
What you did was shameful, Ajumma!

620
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,390
What are you rambling on about?

621
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,490
Peacock feathers and blah-blah-blah?

622
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,910
Apologize for lying about maggots at our fish shop!

623
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,690
I don't want to!

624
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,170
Eonni, did you say that about Myeong Seong's store?

625
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,690
I can't let you off either. Apologize!

626
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,170
What's wrong with you, too, Eun Jeong?

627
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,190
If you're drunk, go home and sleep!

628
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,190
- Apologize! 
 - I don't want to!

629
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,750
- Apologize! 
 - I won't!

630
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,080
- Apologize right now! 
 - No!

631
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,580
What's wrong with you, girl!

632
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,160
Cat.

633
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,960
Did Ajussi go to raise a cat?

634
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,350
How do you know... about the cat?

635
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,410
Did that moron ask you to raise a cat, too?

636
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,400
Did he?

637
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,330
Hey, your girlfriend went to duke it out with Ms. Smile earlier.

638
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,940
- What? 
 - She was so upset.

639
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,230
Over there.

640
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,460
I heard there was a fight at the fish shop.

641
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,910
Geez, I told her to stay put.

642
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,340
Excuse me! Where is Seul Bi?

643
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,830
My girlfriend.

644
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,330
Your girlfriend?

645
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,930
He said she's his girlfriend.

646
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,810
Why are you crying here? Just go!

647
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,600
- Are you okay, Eun Jeong? 
 - Who the heck are you?

648
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,500
We heard there was a fight. I guess everything's okay?

649
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,200
It ended quickly. It was no fun at all.

650
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Why did you down two bottles of soju in the early afternoon?

651
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,130
Seul Bi!

652
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,760
Su Gwang, Ajussi is gathering people to raise a cat.

653
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,040
If he keeps that up, he'll be in big trouble.

654
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,290
Raise a cat?

655
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,060
It's a round coin with a cat on it.

656
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,300
It's not real money. It's toy money.

657
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,970
Mr. Smile is trying to gather people and hit the jackpot.

658
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,150
A coin with a cat on it?

659
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,570
Are you talking about Keticoin? Cryptocurrency?

660
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,370
Is your husband gathering people to invest in cryptocurrency?

661
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,340
He said it's going to make him a lot of money.

662
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,000
He kept taking the money from home.

663
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,350
He even gathered President Park and Mr. Hong to do something together.

664
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,310
Where is your husband right now?

665
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,200
I know where he is.

666
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,610
Let's hurry up and go! Let's go.

667
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,130
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

668
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,510
Where is it? Where should we go?

669
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,590
- Over there! 
 - Oh, okay!

670
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,860
Cat?

671
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,600
Just take a look.

672
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,800
The color itself is different, right? 
  Keticoin

673
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,950
This is just a cat.

674
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,530
- It's a cat. 
 - Yes.

675
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,430
Many people have made money with coins, but many have also lost money.

676
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,420
- Yes. 
 - Right.

677
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,380
Have you ever heard of Melon Musko?

678
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,920
- A famous businessman in the US. 
 - Do you know him?

679
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,600
Melon Musko?

680
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,850
He's very famous!

681
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,200
That's right!

682
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,140
If that person picks something, it becomes a big hit.

683
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,210
Is that so? Really?

684
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,140
Don't tell anyone. No one in the market knows about this.

685
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,480
Do you want to raise a cat?

686
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,450
Shall we?

687
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,510
- Yes, yes. 
 - Write your name and...

688
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,340
- Cat... 
 - All right.

689
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,460
Everyone, freeze!

690
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,340
What's wrong with you? Grownups are talking here.

691
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,900
If you recruit investors for a pyramid scheme,

692
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,050
you'll become a criminal.

693
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,850
That coin company asked you to recruit investors, right?

694
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,080
The coin pyramid scheme is illegal.

695
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,250
You're criminally liable for fraud if you listen to the company and recruit new investors.

696
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,240
A pyramid scheme's members can be punished

697
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,110
along with the company for conspiracy to commit fraud.

698
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,360
- No, it's not... 
 - Fraud?

699
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,160
Aigoo, sit down, sit down!

700
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,370
I told you not to do it!

701
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,700
Why don't you believe me?

702
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,590
No one has invested yet, right?

703
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,140
- No, no! 
 - No, no, we haven't yet!

704
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,550
If you stop here right now, I'll turn a blind eye.

705
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,120
- Of course, we stop! 
 - Stop!

706
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,650
Look here!

707
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,210
What's with the cat?

708
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,780
Oh, seriously!

709
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,860
- Geez! 
 - Oh, sh*t.

710
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,630
- How could you do that? 
 - Hold it!

711
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,740
- Move! 
 - Just hit me!

712
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,830
I don't mind getting hit.

713
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:06,080
But that company will be investigated.

714
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,300
Those people are so petty.

715
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,940
Aigoo! I told you not to do it, didn't I?

716
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,780
You can just help in the store.

717
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,600
You're just going around everywhere and

718
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,800
doing all sorts of useless things!

719
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,950
Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that?

720
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,920
Ajussi.

721
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,870
Hurry up and take out your investment funds.

722
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,400
Take it out.

723
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,810
Take it all out!

724
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,660
Do you think it's easy for your husband to make money working with fingers and coins?

725
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,480
When I go to our sashimi restaurant, you always scold me saying I can't cut sashimi!

726
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,740
I did all this so that you can live in luxury!

727
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,540
Oh, sh*t!

728
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,070
I mean, did I ever tell you to win the lottery?

729
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,940
Did I ever tell you to strike it rich?

730
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,220
I'm satisfied with you coming out to the store,

731
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,870
putting up the shutter door, and saying hello to the customers.

732
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,750
I won't ask you to cut sashimi anymore.

733
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,940
Your pretty hands.

734
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,250
I know how you feel.

735
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,890
Let go of my hand! Forget it!

736
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:07,110
How embarrassing in front of the investors on the brink of signing up for investments!

737
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,730
No. It's not like that.

738
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,700
Do you guys know anything about investments or finance?

739
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,420
Know something about investments before you speak!

740
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,190
Let go of me!

741
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,720
Did you eat something?

742
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:24,780
Sister...

743
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,070
Thank you.

744
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,630
In return, tonight...

745
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,570
- I'll treat you! 
 - No, you don't have to.

746
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,340
What does that mean?

747
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,960
Are you curious?

748
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,840
- Now, cheers! 
 - Cheers!

749
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,890
- Bottoms up! 
 - Bottoms up!

750
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,460
So refreshing.

751
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,610
It's bitter.

752
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,440
Please drink slowly.

753
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,800
Your face is really red right now.

754
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,090
No, I don't want to.

755
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,450
Since Smile eonni said she would treat me,

756
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,310
I should take it.

757
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:03,760
Aigoo, my Seul Bi is right!

758
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,630
Eonni. It's on me, Eonni.

759
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,890
Please bring us half-seasoned and half-fried chicken quickly.

760
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,420
Eun Jeong.

761
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,490
Go get one-seasoned and one-fried.

762
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,930
And get more bottles of soju.

763
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,680
Mom, isn't this situation

764
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,070
so cruel?

765
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,800
There's nothing cruel about it. You just have to give up.

766
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,980
Go get some beer, too.

767
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,570
I'm not good at giving up.

768
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,060
Aigoo, you drink well!

769
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,620
Eonni, smile.

770
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,190
Always smile.

771
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,370
Then your husband will also always smile.

772
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,820
You two will smile every day.

773
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,940
Like this?

774
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,570
You are pretty.

775
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,010
Gosh, I'm flattered.

776
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,970
So how did you two meet?

777
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,210
We met like destiny.

778
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,390
Oh, gosh!

779
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,360
Don't listen to her.

780
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,150
It's true, Prince!

781
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,320
- Oh, seriously! 
 - She said prince.

782
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,880
So cringey...

783
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,110
Aigoo, Myeong Seong, you look so happy.

784
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,410
- Sister. 
 - Yes.

785
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,660
Myeong Seong... No, I mean Brother-in-law.

786
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,980
Why are you calling me Brother-in-law?

787
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,580
We're not even married.

788
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,690
What? You guys are going to get married in the future.

789
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:28,340
Brother-in-law, I'm so sorry about the fish shop incident.

790
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,930
I have nothing to say.

791
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,190
You know, the lie I told?

792
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,450
I'll straighten it out with all the market merchants.

793
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:41,820
Let's have a healthy competition like peacock feathers.

794
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,410
Right, peacock feathers.

795
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,280
- Cheers! 
 - Yay!

796
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,640
Sister! Brother-in-law!

797
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,160
If you need anything from now on, just tell me. I'll help you!

798
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,540
- Got it? 
 - Yes!

799
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,460
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

800
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,490
- Cheers? 
 - Bottoms up!

801
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:05,060
Ms. Smile and Go Myeong Seong are enemies,

802
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,280
but are they close friends now?

803
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,460
She's extraordinary.

804
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,160
Mr. Wang even exempted interest for Go Myeong Seong.

805
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,980
Oh my. What in the world?

806
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,630
Gosh, that's bbiakida!  (Squeaky baby chick "peep peep" sound that is slang for "crooked.")

807
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,460
Bbiak bbiak. Let's go.

808
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,690
I'm not going to play with them.

809
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,850
The earth is spinning round and round.

810
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,470
Su Gwang, I feel like...

811
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:31,000
I'm experiencing the Heliocentric theory right now.

812
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,690
People who used to believe in the Celestial theory a long time ago

813
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:42,810
would know that the earth orbits if they drank alcohol.

814
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,410
I got it.

815
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,600
So stop experiencing the alcohol-induced Heliocentric theory and look ahead. Please.

816
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,430
- Look ahead! 
 - Yes.

817
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,030
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

818
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,380
Oh, sh*t.

819
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,500
- Alcohol. 
 - This isn't going to work.

820
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,870
Get on my back.

821
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,950
Oh, hey.

822
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,880
Your back is warm, Su Gwang.

823
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,990
It's cozy,

824
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,400
spacious,

825
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,370
and so nice.

826
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:25,270
Gosh, you're heavy. Be quiet.

827
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,630
Let me focus on walking.

828
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,440
Su Gwang.

829
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,990
What?

830
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,650
I'm so, so happy!

831
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,870
Okay.

832
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,670
- Su Gwang. 
 - What?

833
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,160
It's strange.

834
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,170
What's strange?

835
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,520
What's so hot?

836
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,270
What's so hot?

837
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,430
Oh, it's gross.

838
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,150
Su Gwang, do you want me to help you with the laundry?

839
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,520
Geez, that's okay!

840
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,160
Geez!

841
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,280
Geez, hey, hey!

842
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,800
Hey, wash your face and your hair.

843
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,770
No, at least brush your teeth.

844
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,250
Gosh.

845
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,170
Gosh.

846
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,900
Aigoo...

847
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,300
She is driving me crazy!

848
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,560
She didn't even change her clothes.

849
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,490
Geez. Did she wash or what?

850
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,780
Oh, gosh. Seriously.

851
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,450
She really doesn't listen to me.

852
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,890
You are really interesting.

853
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,600
Why did you run away?

854
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,230
What did you experience?

855
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,580
Oh, hey, hey. Why, why?

856
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,650
Oh no! Do you feel like throwing up?

857
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,760
Hold on for a minute!

858
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,420
Hey, here.

859
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,320
Shall we take her to Busan?

860
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,970
â™«  Please notice me  â™«

861
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,410
â™«  I'll smile a little more  â™«

862
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,760
â™«  I'll look at you a little more  â™«

863
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,040
â™«  Please notice my heart  â™«

864
00:52:54,550 --> 00:53:00,360
â™«  Feel the feeling of walking on the clouds with me  â™«

865
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:08,980
â™«  If you hold my hand, I can go higher  â™«

866
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:16,160
â™«  I'm in love with you  â™«

867
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,630
The fish shop owner totally got caught.

868
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,460
I've been caught.

869
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:28,220
â™«  We will never experience this moment again  â™«

870
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:34,540
â™«  Do you know how I feel?  â™«

871
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,090
â™«  Do you feel the same as me?  â™«

872
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,220
Stop it, my heart.

873
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,320
Don't go wild.

874
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,720
Su Gwang.

875
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,120
Yeah. Yeah.

876
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,020
Why?

877
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,900
I'm in trouble.

878
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,620
I think I've got a serious illness.

879
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,680
What kind of illness?

880
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,980
In my the head,

881
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:30,650
a male kangaroo of the marsupial family is jumping around.

882
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:38,170
Inside my stomach, a giant animal plankton jellyfish is attacking with its tentacles.

883
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:41,530
It looks like everything is waving.

884
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:44,570
I feel like I'm in the ocean.

885
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,310
It's hard to diagnose because the symptoms are complex,

886
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,630
but I think it's a hangover.

887
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,530
Hangover?

888
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:55,850
Is it an incurable disease?

889
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,560
Yes.

890
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,040
Whoa, you're in big trouble.

891
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,650
It's incurable!

892
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,500
What are you going to do?

893
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,720
What should I do?

894
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:14,540
I wanted to live happily with you for a long time, Su Gwang.

895
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,380
Are you crying for real?

896
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,290
I was joking.

897
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,460
Joking?

898
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,570
It's not an incurable disease.

899
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,880
A hangover is just a disease caused by drinking too much.

900
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,480
Then, will I get better soon?

901
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,430
Yeah, I made some dried pollack soup.

902
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,730
You'll feel better if you eat a bowl of it.

903
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,690
I feel a little better now.

904
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,610
Whoa, that was so refreshing.

905
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,220
Take it easy with drinks from now on.

906
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,590
By the way...

907
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:55,770
By chance, do you remember what happened last night?

908
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,430
Yeah.

909
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,950
With Smile Eonni,

910
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:04,330
we mixed soju with beer, made a swirl, and drank it.

911
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,830
And you carried me on your back.

912
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,660
And then...

913
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,540
And then?

914
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,470
I don't remember.

915
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,520
- You don't remember? 
 - No.

916
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,240
Oh, did I come home and sleep?

917
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,730
No more drinking for you from now on.

918
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:23,680
Don't you ever drink!

919
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,990
What a terrible drinking habit.

920
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,610
You're blushing, Su Gwang.

921
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,580
Do you have a fever?

922
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,290
No, I don't have a fever.

923
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,110
By any chance, last night, did I...

924
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,750
Yeah.

925
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,820
You did what?

926
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,770
Did I... to you...

927
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,840
To me, what?

928
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,120
Do you remember?

929
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,360
Did I throw up?

930
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,210
Huh?

931
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,720
I feel like I threw up on your back.

932
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,340
Yeah.

933
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,050
You threw up.

934
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,550
Totally. A lot.

935
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,100
I'm so sorry!

936
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:21,660
 Lucky Fish Shop

937
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,810
Hello.

938
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,030
Look at this, Su Gwang. It's a puppy that's a mammal of the carnivorous canine family.

939
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,330
She's so soft.

940
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,790
She looks like a stray.

941
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:48,100
Oh, you can't take her to the store.

942
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,790
We can call the dog shelter and ask them to take her.

943
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,730
I don't want to.

944
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,070
I have enough on my plate with just you alone.

945
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,710
Is my house a lost child shelter or something?

946
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,840
Do I have to raise a stray dog, too?

947
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,590
I'm not asking you to raise it.

948
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,600
Then what are you going to do?

949
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,550
Hey, do you give just anyone a kisâ€”

950
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,650
I mean, a peck.

951
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,740
When did I do that?

952
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,300
Let's go.

953
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,690
Oh, here's lucky Myeong Seong!

954
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:32,000
Hi, Myeong Seong.

955
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,700
It's Su Gwang, Su Gwang.

956
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,070
She keeps calling him Su Gwang since last time.

957
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:39,020
All the market people know me as Go Myeong Seong.

958
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,350
Just call me Myeong Seong.

959
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,740
I like Su Gwang though.

960
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,990
- Hello, Myeong Seong. 
 - Hi.

961
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,490
Hello.

962
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,980
Hello. Hello.

963
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:54,010
How come market people are saying hi to me first?

964
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,280
The golden time to get a puppy back after it goes missing is three hours.

965
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,680
There is a high probability of finding it within three hours since it hovers around the house.

966
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,950
But after three hours, your chance of finding it drops sharply as the puppy is out of the radius.

967
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,110
Now, 13 hours and 30 minutes have passed.

968
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:18,200
- Twenty-four hoursâ€” 
 - Yeong Wu!

969
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:21,420
It's Jjong!

970
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,570
Was she Yeong Wu's puppy?

971
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:25,580
Where did you find her?

972
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,040
On the way to the market.

973
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,760
Since when did you raise a puppy?

974
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,600
We're not raising her.

975
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,610
Yeong Wu's grandmother sent her as a gift through someone she knows.

976
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:39,130
We can't have dog hair flying around in a side dish store.

977
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,350
Yeong Wu always carries the dog to the store.

978
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,400
We should send her back to my mother's home.

979
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,190
How should we send her back?

980
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,540
What's the matter?

981
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,690
We have to go all the way down to Busan.

982
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,900
But we even have baekban (meal, soup, rice, side dish) deliveries to the construction site now,

983
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,520
so we don't have a day off.

984
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,750
We don't even have anyone to ask.

985
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,710
Jjong says she wants to go back home.

986
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:02,980
I'll take her home after our store closes today.

987
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,500
No, I meant your grandma's home in Busan.

988
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,580
If Jjong wants to go, it's right to let her go.

989
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:12,020
Jjong has to live where she wants to live.

990
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:16,140
Jjong, do you want to go back to Busan?

991
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,150
I want to go to Busan, too.

992
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,310
 Shall we take her to Busan?

993
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,150
Shall we take her to Busan?

994
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,920
Really?

995
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:36,710
Are we going to take Jjong to Busan?

996
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,330
Sure.

997
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,680
Hey, Su Gwang, look at this.

998
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,470
I'm eating the wind.

999
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,680
Hey, it's dangerous. Don't stick your head out the window.

1000
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,620
What are you doing like a kid?

1001
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:56,130
Oh, it's a puffy cloud! Puffy cloud!

1002
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,510
Hey, hey, hey, is that something to scream about?

1003
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,940
Cumulus cloud. The cumulus cloud has flat bases.

1004
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,030
The top is fluffy, like a pile of cotton.

1005
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,400
It shines white in the sun.

1006
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,590
Fluffy, fluffy.

1007
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:15,130
It looks like beer foam.

1008
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,130
Oh, I want to drink alcohol.

1009
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,240
What?

1010
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,980
Su Gwang, let's have chicken and beer when we get to Busan.

1011
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,160
Okay.

1012
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,890
Fluffy, fluffy.

1013
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,960
Beer foam.

1014
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:37,810
â™«  It was hard, but I was happy to meet her  â™«

1015
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:43,520
â™«  Even though I knew I'll be sad over time  â™«

1016
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:49,650
â™«  Having to face a breakup that you don't know when will happen  â™«

1017
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:54,960
â™«  We were always holding hands  â™«

1018
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:01,950

1019
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:05,060
 Jinxed at First

1020
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,340
 They went to Busan?

1021
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,050
 Why did they go there?

1022
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,030
 What were you talking about earlier?

1023
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:11,690
 Our gang is looking for Miss Seul Bi.

1024
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,020
 I heard you dismissed the search team.

1025
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,720
 Why all of a sudden?

1026
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,640
 There are other people looking for Miss Seul Bi.

1027
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,650
 How great is she that they are doing this?

1028
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,860
 - I'll compensate everything. 
 - Why would you do that?

1029
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,580
 Did you wrong me in some way?

1030
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,890
 If I have that child taken away from me,

1031
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:32,750
 do you still not know what I will do, Hyeongnim?

1032
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,810
â™«  I'll love you  â™«
