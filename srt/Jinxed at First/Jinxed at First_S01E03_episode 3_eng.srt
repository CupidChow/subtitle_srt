1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,410
It's all my fault!

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,910
Please let her go.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,710
Whoa, you're going to make me cry.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,650
Bringing me to tears...

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,050
Su Gwang.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,320
- Wait. 
 - Wait?

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,010
When I say something, throw this as hard as you can.

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,150
That way.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,450
What the...

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,620
That way?

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,200
Throw it and see what happens.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,080
There you go.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,460
Why did you run away if you were going to go along with me after all?

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,020
- Alright! Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,500
- "Gas stove." 
 - Gas stove?

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,570
Mom…

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,440
- Hyeongnim, what's the matter? 
 - Mom...

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,660
Mom should answer my call…

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,360
What's wrong all of a sudden? Hyeongnim!

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,900
- "I won the lottery!" 
 - Lottery?

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,370
Our house is going to go up in flames!

22
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,440
Hey, what's going on?

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,020
I told you to switch it to an induction stove!

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,170
"I have a stomachache."

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,860
"Irritable bowel syndrome."

26
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,220
Restroom… I-I-I need to go to the restroom.

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,870
Our house is going to catch on fire!

28
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,230
Hurry up and pick up the phone, Mom!

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,510
What's the matter?

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,640
Su Gwang, now is the time! Throw it!

31
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,260
Throw it! Here!

32
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,490
What's that?

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,510
What the…

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,060
Hey.

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,920
Who threw the f**king brick?

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,290
Who the hell are you, f**ker?

37
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,690
Hurry up and confess now.

38
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,470
Which punk threw the brick?

39
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,100
Hey, Pig gang!

40
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,410
Hey, these damn pigs! Get them!

41
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,570
- This punk! 
 - Get them! You Pig gang!

42
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,890
How did we run into each other like this?

43
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,490
My house is on fire. I have to go now!

44
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,590
I won the lottery! I won the lottery.

45
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,150
It's coming out. It's coming out. It's coming out.

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,910
I need to go to the restroom. I need to go badly.

47
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,550
E-E-Excuse me.

48
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,080
- Are you detectives? 
 - Who the hell are you?

49
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,000
Is he one of you?

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,190
No, we don't know him.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,850
I told you! A curse is coming out from here. From here!

52
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,290
What a crazy punk.

53
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,680
Hey, who threw the brick, punks?

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,830
I don't know. I don't know.

55
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,470
I did!

56
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,750
It's because those ajussis were trying to kidnap me.

57
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,460
Good job, Miss.

58
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,200
You really did a great job.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,970
What a bunch of a**holes!

60
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,980
- How many criminal charges do you have now? 
 - Detective Kang, Detective Kang!

61
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,630
You guys are nothing, bastards!

62
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,590
Miss, are you alright?

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,030
Sorry?

64
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,170
Considering the situation, you need to give us a witness statement.

65
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,790
You don't need to go to the headquarters. You can just go to the station with us

66
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,290
and make a brief statement and go home.

67
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,480
 Episode 3 

68
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,290
So you just bumped into the bad guys on the street?

69
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,840
So you just bumped into them, and they tried to sell you off for money?

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,510
I understand. Then I'll write that on your statement.

71
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,030
Officer Kim, write it up quickly and send them home.

72
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,480
Yes, sir. Come here, please.

73
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,710
Hey, why didn't you mention Mr. Wang?

74
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,100
He's the one who kidnapped you.

75
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,720
Who is Mr. Wang?

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,510
T-The one who suddenly helped us earlier.

77
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,970
 The odd girl! 

78
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,140
 Don't forget what you said! 

79
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,830
Mr. Wang is a good man to you, Su Gwang.

80
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,290
What?

81
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,620
Why isn't Myeong Seong back yet?

82
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,520
What the heck is this situation?

83
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,370
Brioni suit, Constantin watch,

84
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,320
Louis Vuitton shoes.

85
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,650
He's so perfect.

86
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,460
I used to be like that in the past.

87
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,110
- Okay. 
 - In the past?

88
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,240
When in the past?

89
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,100
I know because I used to sell imitation brands.

90
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,050
All those are authentic brands. Authentic!

91
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,710
Even those who didn't run that business

92
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,560
can see he is very classy and elegant if they have eyes.

93
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,450
So, Oppa,

94
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,170
why did she leave that classy and elegant man behind

95
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,270
and come to find such an unlucky guy like Go Myeong Seong?

96
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,040
So she came to Myeong Seong after rejecting him?

97
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,780
Isn't it obvious?

98
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,880
A rich girl who's about to marry a rich son of a chaebol family 
 (Chaebol: family-owned conglomerate.)

99
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,160
has fled for love beyond the status difference.

100
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,750
Flee for love?

101
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,200
- Wow. 
 - Oh my.

102
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,920
Oh my, oh my.

103
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,710
He saw us.

104
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,580
Yes, I'm coming back to the hotel right now.

105
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,320
Seul Bi.

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,610
So what's your last name? Your last name?

107
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,530
Seul Bi.

108
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,400
Just Seul Bi. It's Seul Bi.

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,790
Nothing comes up. There's no last name Seul.

110
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,350
What do you mean there isn't?

111
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,060
I'm saying my name is Seul Bi.

112
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,840
Well, she doesn't have an identification card.

113
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,420
We can't find her fingerprints in the system.

114
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,690
By chance, does she have a different nationality?

115
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,370
She lived abroad and came to Korea after a long time.

116
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,060
But she lost her memory in an accident.

117
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,720
Then she must have a passport, but she doesn't even have it.

118
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:01,860
Miss, you don't even remember which country you're from?

119
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,250
Far... far away.

120
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,820
Far... away.

121
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,080
I see. It's the US.

122
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,840
Canada?

123
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,080
England!

124
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,720
We need to know which country you're from,

125
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,160
so we can contact the embassy.

126
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,690
Then there's no way to find Seul Bi's family?

127
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,060
Usually, the family comes to find her in this case,

128
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,390
or she suddenly says, "Oh, I remember everything."

129
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,210
That's the only way.

130
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,970
By chance, is there a shelter where she can stay for a while?

131
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,600
Yes, there is, but...

132
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,900
There are so many homeless people in the building.

133
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,920
So it would be a little tough for a young lady to stay there.

134
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,940
How can we send a lady like this to a homeless shelter?

135
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,570
Don't do that. It seems you guys have something going on.

136
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,200
Just stay together for a while.

137
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,840
Oh, sh*t.

138
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,620
Hey, a**hole, give it to me. Give it to me.

139
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,070
What's wrong? Why?

140
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,830
- You a**hole. 
 - Why?

141
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,220
What's wrong? Why?

142
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,450
- You, a**! 
 - No! I don't want to!

143
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,660
Why should I give this money back?

144
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,810
We have to give this back, so the f**king pigs will let her go!

145
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,730
Why do you care about that girl?

146
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,480
Why are you doing this to me because of that b*tch?

147
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,520
Come on! You f**ker.

148
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,840
You f**ker, I already told you this.

149
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,260
I'm not selling people.

150
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,340
Oh, sh*t.

151
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,720
Hey, Pig Hyeongnim.

152
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,990
What?

153
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,450
Hey, you should ghost him for a while.

154
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,240
Why should I?

155
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,850
All of Pig Hyeongnim's guys were arrested.

156
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,030
What?

157
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,500
Why? Why? Because of that girl?

158
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,940
Just take that and go into hiding.

159
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,040
Throw away your cell phone, and don't show up in this neighborhood for a while.

160
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,130
- What about you, Hyeong? 
 - I should go to Hyeon Su.

161
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,380
Hyeong, what about that money—

162
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,790
Hey, let's just go home. Where the heck are we going?

163
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,500
I have to keep my promise to Mr. Wang.

164
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,570
So do you know where you are going?

165
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,580
I think it's around here.

166
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,290
I found him.

167
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,210
Hurry up, Su Gwang.

168
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,040
Hi.

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,530
Who are you?

170
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,050
You must be Hyeon Su.

171
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,920
Your dad sent me here.

172
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,540
Mr. Wang.

173
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,690
 Su Gwang, now is the time! Throw it! 

174
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,130
 Throw it! Here! 

175
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,480
Everything is fine now. Let's go.

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
Okay.

177
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,650
Dad!

178
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,910
Hey, Hyeon Su, why are you up this late?

179
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,560
Let's go to sleep.

180
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,070
Dad, did you fight again?

181
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,730
No.

182
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,250
I just fell and banged my face.

183
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,460
You bumped against the wall last time, too.

184
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,470
I bumped into the wall again this time, too. Let's go in.

185
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,940
Dad, Seul Bi Noona came and gave this to me.

186
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,510
- What's this? 
 - 30,000 won.

187
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,950
Is she teasing me or something?

188
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,040
She said we should take this and meet Ong Gom.

189
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,720
- Ong Gom?
 - Yeah.

190
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,300
She said to go to the ice cream place across from Venus' headquarters tomorrow.

191
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,110
What nonsense did she ramble about?

192
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,910
It's good that she wasn't sold off.

193
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,220
What?

194
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,830
What am I doing right now?

195
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,850
Su Gwang, I won't follow people I don't know anymore.

196
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,840
I won't use money and cards carelessly.

197
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,810
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, sit up. 
 - Yes?

198
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,670
- Earlier, in the alley, 
 - Yeah.

199
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,030
didn't you say "wait" and "throw it" to me?

200
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,820
- Well... 
 - And

201
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,920
how did you know there were detectives there?

202
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,810
Oh, that.

203
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,670
I heard a police car.

204
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,530
Beeboop, beeboop!

205
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,750
Didn't you hear that?

206
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,630
Oh no! I guess you were too scared to hear the police car.

207
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,580
Is that it?

208
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,030
What about this?

209
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,520
You held the bad guys' hands, and they suddenly had a stomachache and...

210
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,520
won the lottery. How did you do that?

211
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,510
I don't know. That's because those ajussis were weird.

212
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,120
I didn't do anything.

213
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,230
Hey, why do you always wear these gloves? Aren't you hot?

214
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,950
It hurts here.

215
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,420
Hold on.

216
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,240
Why are you laughing?

217
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,490
It hurts here, too.

218
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,270
Please blow on it.

219
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,210
Come on.

220
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,140
Don't be such a crybaby. Just go to bed.

221
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,720
Where are you going?

222
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,820
Go to sleep.

223
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,320
What about you?

224
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,060
I'm going to drop by somewhere for a second.

225
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,990
- I want to go with you.
 - No.

226
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,440
Please don't go anywhere. Just stay here.

227
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,560
Please! Got it?

228
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,660
Okay!

229
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,160
I won't go anywhere.

230
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,770
I'll be at your house, Su Gwang.

231
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,460
Bye bye!

232
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,240
 You ungrateful bastard! 

233
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,830
 Send the guest's child back to the room. 

234
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,340
 He attempted to kidnap a hotel guest's child. 

235
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,390
 Take him to the police station. 

236
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,050
Hello, sir. Did you make a reservation?

237
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:37,010
No, do any of the hotel guests have a missing daughter, by any chance?

238
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,010
As far as I know, no one is missing a child.

239
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,190
If you leave the child's name and your number,

240
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,300
I'll check and give you a call.

241
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,270
She's not a child.

242
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,880
With tens of people on a search team, you still can't find a girl?

243
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,650
We are also very frustrated.

244
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,700
We need to know the identity of the runaway girl to do a proper investigation.

245
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,980
All you gave us was a picture of her.

246
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,940
You didn't tell us her cell phone number, home number, or anything.

247
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,150
Find her this week if you don't want to lose your job.

248
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,030
- Excuse me, Team Leader. 
 - Yeah, why?

249
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:17,120
That man was asking if any of the guests had a missing child.

250
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,190
Excuse me.

251
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,930
Excuse me.

252
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,180
Hey, hey, get him!

253
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,800
Hey, you go left.

254
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,720
You go that way!

255
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,150
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,990
Su Gwang.

257
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,210
Hurry up and go.

258
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,950
- What's going on? 
 - Go that way.

259
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,870
Director, did you see anyone wearing a baseball cap?

260
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,310
Someone wearing a baseball cap?

261
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,710
- He went that way. 
 - Move it! Hurry!

262
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,670
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Su Gwang. 

263
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,290
Being able to bring Dr. Kang to our side is also

264
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,070
thanks to that child's ability.

265
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,930
I did meet Dr. Kang because Seul Bi asked to go there.

266
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,400
But I'm the one who captured the attention of Dr. Kang.

267
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,250
It's my ability.

268
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,620
Find the missing child first.

269
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,290
Is she like lost property or something?

270
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,990
She felt frustrated here, so she left on her own.

271
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,190
She'll come back when she feels a little bit of freedom.

272
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,250
That child...

273
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,580
is not supposed to be in the world.

274
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,340
Father.

275
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,770
Don't treat people like objects!

276
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,130
That's why you had Mother in your tight grasp.

277
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,780
If you did that, you should've at least stayed with Mother when she died.

278
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,160
Let's stop talking about that.

279
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,530
You're smiling?

280
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,730
You're smiling!

281
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,860
I finished this.

282
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,940
Tell me.

283
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,240
Where the hell is your daughter?

284
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,480
Where are you, Seul Bi?

285
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,030
Seul Bi.

286
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,830
Where are you, Seul Bi?

287
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,840
Seul Bi.

288
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,180
Seul Bi.

289
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,000
Seul Bi.

290
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,460
Seul Bi.

291
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,510
What kind of show are you putting on in front of me?

292
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,090
Seul Bi asked me to make a stuffed rabbit.

293
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,780
Don't touch my daughter's stuff.

294
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,130
She asked me to make gloves, too.

295
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,430
Seul Bi.

296
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,380
I'll make you gloves, too, Seul Bi.

297
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,450
Seul Bi.

298
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,800
Where did Seul Bi go?

299
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,660
Seul Bi.

300
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,600
Seul Bi.

301
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,480
Mom, he's coming. He's coming.

302
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,720
 Bike Thief! 

303
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,140
Oh, right.

304
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,540
Where's my bike?

305
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,370
Myeong Seong, Eun Su's lying, right?

306
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,340
You wouldn't do that, would you? Right?

307
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,570
Noona, whose side are you on?

308
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,200
Well...

309
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,190
 Pay 200,000 won (~$200) for the bike! 

310
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,550
Two hundred thousand...

311
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,160
Ms. Bang, the bike must still be there.

312
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,860
I'll go and get it right now.

313
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,200
Mom! 
  Pay 200,000 won for the bike! 

314
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,820
Does it make sense? You want 200,000 won? Two hundred thousand won?

315
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,440
Just stay back. Ouch. It's not even yours.

316
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,060
"Forty thousand won?"

317
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,350
Forty thousand won.

318
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,460
Mom, we bought that used bike for 40,000 won.

319
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,250
That's fine, Ajussi. I was going to throw it away anyway.

320
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,300
Eun Su. Oh Eun Su, what are you talking about?

321
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,980
What's wrong with him all of a sudden?

322
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,400
Anyway, I'll go get the bike right away.

323
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,870
Sorry, I'll be right back.

324
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,940
Oh, wait.

325
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,800
Wait! Hey.

326
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,140
Mom, who the heck is she?

327
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,740
I think she just came down from upstairs.

328
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,040
Did she come down from the rooftop?

329
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,990
I know. I told him to move out, but he won't move out.

330
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,670
Mom, my bike.

331
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,480
You said you'd get 200,000 won from him and buy me a new one.

332
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,810
What, punk? You said, "We bought that used bike for 40,000 won."

333
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,560
"I was going to throw it away anyway."

334
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,090
- What bullsh*t! 
 - I did?

335
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,490
When did I say that? I said that?

336
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,360
Mom!

337
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,280
She can't be Myeong Seong's girlfriend, right? She must be family, right?

338
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,220
They look like each other, right?

339
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,360
- Right, Mom? 
 - Mom, my bike.

340
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,600
Gosh, you guys are killing me!

341
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,780
Oh, what a relief. Nobody took it.

342
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,640
We found it! We found it!

343
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,020
Why aren't you getting on?

344
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,430
Can I get on?

345
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,710
Yeah.

346
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,000
Hey. Not so close.

347
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,830
You'll smell fishy like me.

348
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,290
You smell good, Su Gwang.

349
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,130
Let's go!

350
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,550
 You shouldn't take these off, Seul Bi. 

351
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,410
 They're uncomfortable. 

352
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,070
 I want to take them off. 

353
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,930
 No, Seul Bi. 

354
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,420
 It's dangerous to touch people with your bare hands. 

355
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,580
 Why can't I? 

356
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,200
 Why can't I touch people? 

357
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,320
 Seeing the future is dangerous. 

358
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,080
 We can see the future, 

359
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,160
 prevent other people's misfortune, and bring good luck. 

360
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,640
 But that misfortune... doesn't go away. 

361
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,260
 It doesn't go away? 

362
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,430
 The misfortune builds up inside us. 

363
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,610
 So, Seul Bi, never take off your gloves recklessly. 

364
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,860
Eun Su, I left your bike here.

365
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,670
I'm sorry.

366
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,790
Don't worry about it, Myeong Seong.

367
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,110
By the way, your younger sister is very pretty.

368
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,460
I'm not his younger sister.

369
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,920
Excuse me?

370
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,320
Then what kind of relationship?

371
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,810
Well...

372
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,830
What's wrong? Do you have a headache?

373
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,800
I'm...

374
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,180
hungry.

375
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,080
You didn't give me dinner.

376
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,090
Geez, I'm sorry.

377
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,190
I'll cook ramen for you. Let's go up.

378
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,750
Ramen?

379
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,450
Ramen?

380
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,050
Ramen?

381
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,150
- Oh my! 
 - What was that?

382
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,140
What was that attitude of ultimate devotion?

383
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,580
Oh, she's his noona! Noona!

384
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,880
Gosh, she must be his older sister.

385
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,240
I like ramen, too...

386
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,940
Here.

387
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,810
It's yummy.

388
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,650
- You took off your gloves. 
 - Yeah, I don't need to wear them anymore.

389
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,370
- Is this your first time eating ramen, too? 
 - Yeah.

390
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,330
It's not that you don't remember?

391
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,120
How could I not remember this yummy food?

392
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,090
You don't even remember your parents.

393
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,280
Well, you're right.

394
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,720
I guess I tried ramen before,

395
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,960
but maybe I don't remember.

396
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,740
You ran away from home, didn't you?

397
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,650
Your parents must be worried.

398
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,950
Su Gwang.

399
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,800
I've never eaten anything like this before.

400
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,090
It was my first time riding a bike in my life.

401
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,600
It was my first time eating kkwabaegi (twisted donuts).

402
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,400
You must've been surrounded by expensive food and precious things.

403
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,440
When I first met you, it was my first time riding a bus.

404
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,800
You must have had a driver.

405
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,040
No, that's not it.

406
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,210
I don't know why you ran away from your home.

407
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,940
Many people in the world are living a hard life.

408
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,700
Many people live each day with all their might.

409
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,500
And there are lots of bad people, too. So,

410
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,310
- if you came out for fun, not knowing the world— 
 - No!

411
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,240
I didn't.

412
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,070
I didn't come out for fun.

413
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,240
Su Gwang.

414
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,670
Don't send me back.

415
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,340
Please?

416
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,200
Then just stay here for now.

417
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,530
For now.

418
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,400
Hey. When you eat ramen,

419
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
you shouldn't eat out of a bowl like this.

420
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,100
You should put ramen on the lid of the pot.

421
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,030
You should eat like this.

422
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,560
It tastes good if you put it on the lid.

423
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,930
Now, when you want to cook ramen,

424
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,990
open the gas valve first.

425
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,000
- Open it. 
 - Next...

426
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,470
- There. 
 - Oh my!

427
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,160
- Now we're done cooking. What should we do next? 
 - Eat it.

428
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,210
No, for safety,

429
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,510
we have to turn off the stove and be sure to close the gas valve tight.

430
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,700
Close it tight.

431
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,420
Otherwise, the gas might leak and cause a fire.

432
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,250
When you do the laundry,

433
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,120
- put in the detergent and close the lid. 
 - Close it.

434
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,970
- Press these buttons one at a time. 
 - Press them.

435
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,610
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

436
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,320
Now, this thing is easy.

437
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,510
- Turn it, wait, "ding," then it's done. 
 - Ding!

438
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,180
When you pour water into the rice cooker,

439
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,520
there's a line for water based on the amount of rice.

440
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,590
- I want to try. 
 - Alright, go ahead.

441
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,810
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. This...

442
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:00,110
This got hot! Never put this in!

443
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,030
It'll explode.

444
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,990
 Su Gwang. 

445
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,090
 Hurry up and go. 

446
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,180
Why did he let me run away?

447
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,830
Did he think I should run away?

448
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,150
From what?

449
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,600
From what...

450
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,380
You know what's going on.

451
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,270
Seon Min Joon.

452
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,810
 Min Joon, I heard that Su Gwang died. 

453
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,570
 By chance, did you do it, Father? 

454
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,760
 Min Joon, let's go. 

455
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,230
 - Father. 
 - Min Joon, let's go! 

456
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,400
 - Please answer me! 
 - Min Joon! 

457
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,120
 Please answer me! Answer me, Father! 

458
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,920
Su Gwang.

459
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,310
Are you scared?

460
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,280
I...

461
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,060
know what happened to Ms. Min, who used to work here.

462
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,360
Why?

463
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,960
Are you going to let that happen to me, too?

464
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,570
Tell me.

465
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,570
Where is Seul Bi?

466
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,510
Where's Seul Bi?

467
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,520
Where's Seul Bi?

468
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,390
Tell me!

469
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,390
Where is that rat of yours?

470
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,740
Where is she?

471
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,340
Where?

472
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,500
 While Geumhwa Group's stock prices are falling due to the continuation of bad news, 

473
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,970
 Geumhwa Biotech, embroiled in a patent infringement lawsuit 

474
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,420
 against Jinsung Pharmaceuticals, which filed a lawsuit... 

475
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,130
Chairman Seon.

476
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,210
I went to China to buy what I missed at the last auction.

477
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:48,700
Did you spend that much money just to get something like this?

478
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,530
I heard that its effectiveness is a sure bet.

479
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,800
- Should I put it in your bedroom? 
 - No.

480
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,690
Put it in the living room.

481
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,700
Yes, Chairman.

482
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,010
Oh, what? What? What?

483
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,390
Ouch, it's hot!

484
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,580
What the heck!

485
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,930
What? What?

486
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,710
Hey!

487
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,130
- Su Gwang.
 - Hey!

488
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,100
Hey, what are you doing right now?

489
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,350
I did as you taught me,

490
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,270
but it's weird.

491
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,800
Hey!

492
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,540
Oh, sh*t! Did you put the entire bottle?

493
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,190
Yeah.

494
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,160
Oh, I want to play with bubbles.

495
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,950
Hey!

496
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,650
Seul Bi is laughing.

497
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,950
Play after you eat.

498
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,890
- Wipe your hands. 
 - Oh, right.

499
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,430
Ta-da!

500
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,590
My hands are shining.

501
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,280
It's not like you're a kid.

502
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,990
Is it that fun to play with bubbles?

503
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,380
Yeah.

504
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,700
I'm envious.

505
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,120
Of what?

506
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,100
Because they fly far away.

507
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,920
I was envious of bubbles, balloons, paper airplanes,

508
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,520
and dandelion seeds.

509
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,770
They can fly far away.

510
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,130
Did you want to fly far away?

511
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,780
Yes.

512
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,340
I wanted to fly far away,

513
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,620
but not now.

514
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,090
Because I came to be next to you, Su Gwang.

515
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:45,570
♫  I let you go  ♫

516
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,700
♫  The wind that came back  ♫

517
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,540
You should eat well.

518
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,550
Thank you for this meal!

519
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:00,320
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

520
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:08,050
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

521
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,470
What are you doing?

522
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,020
- Huh? 
 - Were you drawing something?

523
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,800
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

524
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,530
What are you doing? Get ready.

525
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,860
Huh?

526
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,290
Aren't you going to go out?

527
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,460
I'll go!

528
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,860
I'll go! I'll go!

529
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,620
 Ice Cream Place across from Venus headquarters 

530
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,120
Oh, it's here!

531
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,850
Ice cream place across from Venus headquarters...

532
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,980
It's really here.

533
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,670
 Bazaar 

534
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,110
Dad, I want to go there!

535
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,750
Hurry up!

536
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,090
 Bazaar for Pediatric Cancer Patients 

537
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,170
Let's go this way.

538
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,980
Hello, if you pay the participation fee of 30,000 won,

539
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,960
out of toys, clothes, and shoes,

540
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,930
you can take five of them regardless of the type.

541
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,240
I can help you here.

542
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,250
- How much was it again? 
 - It's 30,000 won.

543
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,730
 Dad, Seul Bi Noona came and gave this to me. 

544
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,720
 - What is this? 
 - It's 30,000 won. 

545
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,020
 She said we should take this and meet Ong Gom. 

546
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,530
How could it be exactly 30,000 won?

547
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,210
Yes, thank you!

548
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,360
Hyeon Su, pick five things you want.

549
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,170
Okay.

550
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,520
Oh, right. Ong Gom.

551
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,170
I need to find Ong Gom.

552
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,190
Ong Gom...

553
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,960
Are you Ong Gom?

554
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,900
Are you really Ong Gom?

555
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,250
Let me help you.

556
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,200
Wait a second.

557
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,480
Ta-da!

558
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,530
By chance, are you Ong Gom?

559
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,480
No? Sorry.

560
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,970
Dad, I transformed this.

561
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,220
- Isn't it cool? 
 - Whoa, how great is my Hyeon Su.

562
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,520
You are so cool, Hyeon Su!

563
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,090
Hyeon Su's eyes are very pretty.

564
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,370
Oh, he has pretty eyes because he takes after his mom.

565
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,300
How about...

566
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,380
if I treat Hyeon Su's eyes?

567
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,710
Aigoo. 
  Sunghwa General Hospital Pediatric Cancer Center, Director Moon Woong 

568
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,260
General Hospital Pediatric Cancer Center Director.

569
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,060
- Dr. Moon Woong? 
 - Yes.

570
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,940
Oh, gosh.

571
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,200
 Moon Woong &gt; Ong Gom  
 Ong Gom?

572
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,770
Ong Gom?

573
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,400
Sorry?

574
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,920
Oh my! Beautiful!

575
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,040
Hey, no, no! Go back in! Go back in!

576
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,010
Hey, why not? You go out!

577
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,600
Stay away from her! Don't come close! Don't come close!

578
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,740
Oh my! Wait!

579
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,540
Hey, try this. It would look great on you.

580
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,830
It's pretty.

581
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,780
Turn around. Turn, turn, turn, turn.

582
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,210
Oh, it's too revealing, Hyeong!

583
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,800
Oh my! Her back is too exposed, right?

584
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,810
That way, that way, that way.

585
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,970
Next!

586
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,430
How do I look?

587
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,290
This is not right!

588
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,050
No, not this one either.

589
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,940
Next!

590
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,190
- Am I pretty? 
 - Oh my! You are so pretty!

591
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,480
No, not a swimsuit!

592
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,130
Please choose a casual outfit! Casual outfit!

593
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,200
Why are your legs so pretty?

594
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,400
- Really? 
 - Wow!

595
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,870
Oh, I found it. These, okay?

596
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,470
The hanger (wearer) just glitters like diamond gold.

597
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,520
How can you dress her in these?

598
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,740
You're not selling them?

599
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,840
Fifteen thousand won, 25,000 won, 40,000 won...

600
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,320
There are so many pretty clothes.

601
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,720
Why did you dress her up in weird outfits?

602
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,590
I couldn't sell anything expensive.

603
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,000
- Go! 
 - Bye bye!

604
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,910
Go, go!

605
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,700
- Because of that Myeong Seong. 
 - Bye.

606
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,170
- Go away! 
 - We're leaving.

607
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,750
Gosh, it's so hard to sell without seeing Myeong Seong's face.

608
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,630
I did a good job, right?

609
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,340
But you started your day by selling to Myeong Seong.

610
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,810
Is your business going to be okay today?

611
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,370
He was my first customer...

612
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,170
Oh, I'm screwed.

613
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,000
Hello.

614
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,760
Good morning!

615
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,110
Hello.

616
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,600
- Oh, yes. 
 - Good morning.

617
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,790
- What is this? 
 - She saw this.

618
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,610
Popped rice. Popped rice.

619
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,560
Miss Seul Bi!

620
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,770
Mr. Wang!

621
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,500
Thank you.

622
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,970
- Did you find Ong Gom? 
 - Yes.

623
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,080
Thanks to you, my son...

624
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,070
My Hyeon Su!

625
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,770
Because of eye cancer, he was becoming blind.

626
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,350
I thought, what if he couldn't see his dad's face?

627
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:26,450
What if he follows his mom to heaven at that young age?

628
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,000
I was so scared.

629
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,820
Thanks to you,

630
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:36,960
my Hyeon Su is going to be treated by the best specialist.

631
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,270
Thank you!

632
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,250
Don't cry.

633
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,630
See? Mr. Wang is a good guy.

634
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,200
Oh my.

635
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,050
Mr. Wang is crying.

636
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,430
I have never seen such a scene in my 30 years at Seodong Market.

637
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,860
- Seeing a loan shark crying. 
 - What kind of situation is that now?

638
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,370
What did that woman do?

639
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:13,530
Go Myeong Seong may have brought a bigger headache than himself to our market.

640
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,470
The mood doesn't seem like it'll cause us a headache.

641
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,960
Oppa, what's wrong with you?

642
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,050
Because you're so soft like this, Go Myeong Seong doesn't move out but keeps sticking around!

643
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,220
Oh, she's right. Do it right!

644
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,840
Why are you guys taking it out on me!

645
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,790
Oh, sh*t!

646
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,060
Hey, Go Myeong Seong!

647
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,760
Take good care of Miss Seul Bi.

648
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,980
If you need anything, you can always ask me.

649
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,410
What can I ask of you, Mr. Wang?

650
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,460
Hurry up and ask him a favor.

651
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,750
You have a favor to ask of him.

652
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,190
Then please waive five million won in overdue interest this month.

653
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,870
Alright.

654
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,500
I'll waive your interest.

655
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,210
If I take out the interest, the principal is...

656
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,930
Waive the principal of 15 million won—

657
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,170
You have no conscience!

658
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,830
It'd be nice if you did, but...

659
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,050
Just the overdue interest. Thank you.

660
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,920
Alright, just pay back the principal.

661
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,660
Take your time.

662
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,930
- Oh, it's hot. 
 - Miss Seul Bi, are you hot?

663
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,470
- Yes. 
 - Would you like some ice cream?

664
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,980
Ice cream?

665
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,480
- Ice cream! 
 - Okay...

666
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:35,710
Okay! I will buy everyone ice cream today!

667
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,070
- Huh? 
 - What?

668
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,900
Buy what?

669
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,420
I feel like I'm possessed by something.

670
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,910
Is he the same Mr. Wang who used to bother me

671
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:51,250
365 days a year, on weekdays, weekends, and holidays?

672
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,000
This is a secret.

673
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:02,230
Actually... I'm the goddess of luck.

674
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,790
Wait. I almost believed that.

675
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,560
Oh, it's true!

676
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,220
Please take one.

677
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,720
What's wrong with you, Mr. Wang?

678
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,310
- What's wrong? 
 - Did you win the lottery?

679
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,300
You were crying your eyes out earlier.

680
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,930
Yeah! Mr. Wang can "shoot"* us, too! 
  (Korean slang for treating/paying for someone.) 

681
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,620
- He can "shoot" us! 
 - Enjoy.

682
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,310
But are you going to raise interest while treating us to this?

683
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,630
Geez, what's with you?

684
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,950
- Just enjoy it. 
 - Please don't.

685
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

686
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,590
- Can we really eat this? 
 - Go ahead, go ahead.

687
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,730
- I'll eat it. 
 - Enjoy it! Please!

688
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,700
Great white sharks, cartilaginous fishes belonging to the superorder selachimorpha.

689
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,860
Oh, it really looks like a shark.

690
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,120
So this shark was that type of a shark.

691
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,460
- Myeong Seong, eat this ice cream. 
 - Oh, okay.

692
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,230
I told you it's Su Gwang.

693
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,580
Are you Myeong Seong or Su Gwang?

694
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:11,730
I don't know anymore.

695
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,330
But you know, it's strange.

696
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,250
Why do people hate Su Gwang?

697
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,400
This is what happened.

698
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,140
A year ago, when Go Myeong Seong first appeared in the Seodong Market,

699
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,270
he gave each merchant some dark stories to tell.

700
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,380
Dark stories?

701
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,240
First of all,

702
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,660
Ms. Bang, the owner of the chicken place.

703
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,040
She and her family.

704
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,480
Ms. Bang's son Eun Su and her daughter Eun Jeong each went to take

705
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,560
- the final exam and the civil service exams respectively. 
  - Don't be nervous. 

706
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,700
 Way to go! Way to go! Fighting! 

707
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,540
 - Fighting. 
 - Hello, Ms. Bang! 

708
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,860
 Good morning, Eun Su. Eun Jeong... 

709
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,040
 - My porridge! 
 - Myeong Seong! 

710
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,890
 Did you just buy porridge and drop it? 

711
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,890
 Sh*t! What the f**k! 

712
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:15,110
That day, Eun Su totally "made porridge"* of his exam, 
  (slang for messing up) 

713
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,680
and Eun Jeong totally failed her exam.

714
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,440
Now, next.

715
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,110
President Park, the chairman of the merchant association.

716
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,170
And the rest of the merchants.

717
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:33,150
Last fall, President Park was encouraging a very nice get-together with the market people.

718
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,220
 Okay, if I take this, I'll win! 

719
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,210
 No, no. 

720
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,360
 Here is "Poop"! 
 (Foxglove card name sounds like poop.) 

721
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,840
 So why did you "Pea-poop"* there? 
 (Pea is a single-point card. Mr. Park just gave away a single-point Foxglove card.) 

722
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,450
 Gwangbahk, Peabahk... 
 (Means you're lacking Gwang cards, worth 15 to 30 points, and Pea cards, worth a single point) 

723
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,740
 Hello, hello. 

724
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,630
 Hey, come here. 

725
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,860
 This is Officer Park, who's newly appointed to our district station. 

726
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,930
 - Hello.
 - Hello, nice to meet you! 

727
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,320
 Oh! This is illegal! 

728
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,690
 - It's not illegal! 
 - It's not! 

729
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,720
 - No, it's not. 
 - It's not! 

730
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,710
 Hey, why did you bring a police officer here? 

731
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,220
 Hey, Go Myeong Seong, you! 

732
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,180
 - No! 
 - Hey, today... 

733
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,660
 - No! 
 - Why did you... 

734
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,790
That's how President Park and the other merchants were charged with illegal gambling.

735
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,660
Why is that Su Gwang's fault?

736
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,970
It's not his fault. He's just unlucky.

737
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,370
Now.

738
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,560
And a decisive blow!

739
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,070
- A blow? 
 - Last spring,

740
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,740
the umbrella Myeong Seong was holding got blown away by rain and wind

741
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,640
and got caught in an electric wire.

742
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,870
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

743
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,390
There was a power outage.

744
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,460
It took two days to fix it.

745
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:55,300
So a disaster happened where all the market food went bad.

746
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,170
 - Do we have to throw it away? 
 - Gosh, geez... 

747
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:04,270
 Sh*t, that son of a b*tch Go Myeong Seong! F**k! 

748
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,510
 What should I do with this? 

749
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,020
 Go Myeong Seong, this motherf**ker, I should just! 

750
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,570
So?

751
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,380
My Su Gwang is unlucky?

752
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,010
It's so farfetched!

753
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:25,680
From now on, Su Gwang will be the lucky man in Seodong Market.

754
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,460
What's wrong with her?

755
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,170
I will make you that way.

756
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,540
Make you into a lucky man.

757
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,410
Our father, Chairman Seon Ju Cheol, is too narcissistic.

758
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:48,430
How could he found his company on his birthday

759
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,020
and make us celebrate it no matter what?

760
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,210
Because of that, I have to come every anniversary

761
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,250
even though I got kicked out of Geumhwa!

762
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,330
You said that last year, too.

763
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,330
Do you want me to tell you something else?

764
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,500
That day... I mean the day our father became like that.

765
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,970
You quickly took away what our father had hidden.

766
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:10,990
I never took it away.

767
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,190
I was just chosen.

768
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,240
Is that so?

769
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,880
Whether you were chosen as you said or whatever,

770
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,840
I guess it's not working these days.

771
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,730
Looking at how the company is performing.

772
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,070
- Hyeongnim. 
 - From now on,

773
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,410
celebrate the company anniversary with your employees.

774
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,170
Don't get me confused by celebrating

775
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,490
our father's birthday together!

776
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,920
Young people don't like big events these days.

777
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,900
Do I have to walk on eggshells around young people now?

778
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,860
Next time, I'll consider your concerns.

779
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,290
What the. Shi...

780
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,550
I guess your nightmares are getting worse these days.

781
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,310
I'm talking about that one.

782
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,290
It's a talisman to prevent nightmares.

783
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,020
Right?

784
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,690
Our father once tried to get that thing.

785
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,890
He doesn't need it anymore though.

786
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,650
What does that mean?

787
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,070
Oh, yes, yes.

788
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,480
Well, anyway,

789
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,490
for the future of our Seon family, let's toast.

790
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,060
Cheers!

791
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,190
It will come to us.

792
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:55,250
It will come to us.

793
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,290
It will come to...

794
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,380
No...

795
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,440
Shall we go?

796
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,500
Father.

797
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,210
I have a question.

798
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:26,250
What did Uncle take on the day Grandfather became like that?

799
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,370
Father?

800
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,800
And what nightmares? Is there an illness running in the family?

801
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,110
You don't need to know!

802
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,040
You are always like that.

803
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,660
Uncle is already letting Min Joon manage the company.

804
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,420
You do everything by yourself,

805
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,520
yet you always say I do nothing but play.

806
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,800
I'm still in my prime, punk!

807
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,420
Yes, yes. Stay in control for a long time like the Queen of England.

808
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,680
What did you say?

809
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,430
You arrogant bastard!

810
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,220
Get out, you punk!

811
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,310
What in the world...

812
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:05,630
What is it that they're always talking about in secret?

813
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,060
Oh, this looks yummy.

814
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,660
I want to eat this, too.

815
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,060
I'll eat this too.

816
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,030
Not this one.

817
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,910
Not this one, either.

818
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,310
Just get this.

819
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,970
Oh, Su Gwang, look at this.

820
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,990
It's an earthworm belonging to the annelida clitellata lumbriculida family.

821
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,020
Do you always have to say that?

822
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,710
What?

823
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,250
Why do you call it a complicated, hard-to-remember scientific name?

824
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,980
Worms are just worms.

825
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,420
If I call out their names with sincerity,

826
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,820
I feel like we can meet somehow.

827
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,220
Aigoo, do you?

828
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,660
So you want to meet a worm?

829
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,790
Yes, I want to meet everything in the world.

830
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,950
- Buy it. 
 - Yay!

831
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,360
 Sam Sam Supermarket 

832
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:26,080
 Sam Sam Supermarket 

833
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:34,200
Here, here, here. I'm going to add saury (mackerel pike) and green onions today.

834
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,270
Thank you.

835
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,260
It looks yummy.

836
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:41,770
Hold on.

837
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,010
Oh, we ran out of butane.

838
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,470
I'll go buy it right now.

839
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,280
Wait a little bit.

840
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,120
No, I'll go with you!

841
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,960
Why are you here?

842
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,330
- Su Gwang. 
 - Don't call me by that name.

843
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,350
Su Gwang, I—

844
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,570
Gong Su Gwang already died

845
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,340
two years ago.

846
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,330
Do you remember what you did back then?

847
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,180
 Please let me meet Min Joon! Min Joon! 

848
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,880
 Excuse me! Excuse me! 

849
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,140
 I'm Min Joon's friend! 

850
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,670
 I'm Gong Su Gwang! 

851
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,390
 Min Joon! 

852
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,890
 Min Joon. 

853
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,600
I was also locked up then.

854
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,030
I had no idea what kind of situation you were in.

855
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,930
The Gong Su Gwang you're looking for is no more.

856
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,270
So...

857
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,870
let's not bump into each other again.

858
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,960
Wait for me!

859
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,190
Oh, it smells good!

860
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,620
Hurry up and eat. I'll give you some.

861
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,850
Here you go.

862
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,580
I'll give you some saury, too.

863
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:45,570
Here.

864
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,040
Hurry up and eat it.

865
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,170
I'm going to eat saury.

866
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,260
- I'll enjoy the food. 
 - Yeah.

867
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,370
Oh, it's yummy.

868
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:16,390
What are you doing?

869
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,290
I'm going to help you with your fish shop starting today.

870
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,540
Suddenly? Why?

871
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,010
What do you mean?

872
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:25,080
I said I'll make you the lucky man.

873
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,130
Aigoo. By saying...

874
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:30,260
"Do you want an arthropod belonging to the decapoda macrura family?"

875
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,890
Don't drive out my customers.

876
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,520
Just relax at home.

877
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,680
No, I know how to do business.

878
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,440
How do you do that?

879
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,080
Pick one, pick one, pick one. Buy one, get one free.

880
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,860
If you want, you can get me as a plus.

881
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,010
- Hey! 
 - Huh, why?

882
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,890
Of all things, why did you learn something like that?

883
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,380
Lots of customers came when he did this.

884
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,510
Let's think about this logically.

885
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,270
"If you want, you can take me as a plus" means

886
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:59,040
you are going to sell yourself for money, right?

887
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,790
That's what Pi Tae Sik did to you.

888
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,060
Then is the clothes store ajussi a bad guy, too?

889
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,500
No, Mr. Hong is just saying it as a joke.

890
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,390
Yeah, then I'll say it as a joke, too.

891
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,990
Pick one, pick one, pick one. Pick one, pick one, pick one.

892
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,470
We have arthropoda in the decapoda portunidae family.

893
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,980
Pick one, pick one, pick one. Pick one, pick one, pick one.

894
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,720
We have oceanic fish in the perciformes tichiuridae family.

895
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,320
We have mollusks in the octopoda octopodidae family.

896
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,070
She's got quite a variation.

897
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,160
Hey, "pick one, pick one" is mine. Why did you copy me?

898
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,250
- Pick one, pick one, pick one, pick one. 
 - I don't know, don't know, don't know.

899
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,480
How does she memorize all that?

900
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,710
Tick-Tock, you try it, too.

901
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,080
Arthropoda in the decapoda portunidae family.

902
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,300
Perciformes...

903
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,460
Perciformes...

904
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,070
I don't know it well.

905
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:46,290
Okay.

906
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,900
Good job, my son!

907
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,420
Miss Seul Bi.

908
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,050
Then what's this?

909
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:56,210
It's an oceanic fish, atka mackerel, belonging to the scorpaeniformes hexagrammidae family.

910
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,230
She's a fish expert!

911
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,980
Miss, I should buy one from you.

912
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,220
Give me this one. Scorpaenif something and...

913
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,200
atka mackerel something?

914
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,990
Su Gwang, give her two atka mackerels, oceanic fish

915
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,090
belonging to the scorpaeniformes hexagrammidae family.

916
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:12,360
Oh, okay. Two atka mackerels?

917
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,230
Pick one, pick one, pick one. Pick one, pick one, pick one.

918
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,920
Pick one, pick one, pick one, pick one.

919
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,750
Miss, over here. Two cutlassfish.

920
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,840
Yes.

921
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,720
Su Gwang, that oppa wants two cutlassfish,

922
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,610
oceanic fish belonging to the perciformes trichiuridae family.

923
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,250
- Okay, two cutlassfish. 
 - Thank you.

924
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,470
- Pick one, pick one, pick one. 
 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

925
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,490
Do you know what "oppa" means?

926
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:35,550
Yeah.

927
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:38,260
A word to call older brothers.

928
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,170
Oppa.

929
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,350
That's the meaning, according to a dictionary.

930
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:45,340
But just looking at that ajussi,

931
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,870
he's not your brother and doesn't even look like an oppa.

932
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,700
But when I called them that, men bought a lot of fish from me.

933
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,730
Why are you so careless?

934
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,240
Who the hell is it?

935
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,750
Who took my customers?

936
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,840
Hey, unlucky Go Myeong Seong!

937
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,630
Who the hell are you to take away all my regulars?

938
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:11,180
Ajumma, who are you to yell at my Su Gwang?

939
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,660
Su Gwang? Who the hell is Su Gwang?

940
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,840
Go Myeong Seong!

941
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,330
You, Go Myeong Seong!

942
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:21,610
Are you Su Gwang?

943
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:22,940
I'm not sure...

944
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,210
Who the hell are you?

945
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,410
Why are you making me confused?

946
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,740
And who are you?

947
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,700
Are you his wife or what?

948
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,300
W-Wife?

949
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,960
She's a nobody...

950
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,490
The wife means this, right?

951
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:37,060
A word for a woman you married.

952
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,100
Yes, that's right.

953
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:42,130
I'm indeed his wife.

954
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,500
What are you going to do?

955
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,180
Hey, hey. When did we get married?

956
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,230
That's okay. We will get married in the future.

957
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,620
Wow!

958
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,020
Be quiet!

959
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,000
Su Gwang, I think I'm going to have to fight with this Ajumma.

960
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,810
I will protect my Su Gwang.

961
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,010
Gosh, look at her.

962
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,190
President Park!

963
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,370
Wait, wait, what did she bring?

964
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,630
I should catch this dung fly.

965
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,370
Hey, hey!

966
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,380
- Aigoo. 
 - Stay away.

967
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,310
You think you can catch me with this dung fly swatter?

968
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,480
Do you think I'm scared?

969
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,290
Cat...

970
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:22,970
Does ajussi raise a cat?

971
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,810
What the heck... You...

972
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,560
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

973
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,200
♫  Can't we start our love?  ♫

974
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,400
♫  The only place for my weary heart to rest  ♫

975
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,230
♫  It's in your arms  ♫

976
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:48,620
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

977
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:52,750
♫  Can't I embrace you?  ♫

978
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,320
♫  Even if I get hurt or feel pain,  ♫

979
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:02,980
♫  I'll love you  ♫

980
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,010
 Jinxed at First 

981
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:07,650
 Ajumma! 

982
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,620
 - What! 
 - I heard there's a fight. 

983
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,280
 Geez, I told her to stay put. 

984
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,430
 Who is this woman that Min Joon and Uncle are looking for her all over the place? 

985
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:18,440
 I will not go back. 

986
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,100
 If my father finds out you are here, Su Gwang will be in danger. 

987
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,850
 Su Gwang's back is so warm. 

988
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:28,600
 The longer she's out there, 

989
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,020
 the more that child is going to become a monster. 

990
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:37,100
♫  I'll love you  ♫
