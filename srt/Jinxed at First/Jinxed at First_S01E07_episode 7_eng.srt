00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,270
 Episode 7

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:11,000

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,580
Ta-da!

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,310
You did all this?

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,030
Yeah. Su Gwang and Seul Bi's house.

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,110
I feel like I'm dreaming.

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,760
Come here.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,530
♫  I'll look at you a little longer  ♫

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:45,360
♫  Please notice my feelings for you  ♫

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,770
♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please join me  ♫

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:01:01,620
♫  If you hold my hand, I don't mind flying even higher  ♫

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,740
♫  I'm in love  ♫

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,060
♫  The road that we walk together  ♫

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,400
 Su Gwang &amp; Seul Bi's Lucky Fish Shop, make it big!  
 ♫  For your love  ♫

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,980
♫  The us now that will never be again  ♫

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:27,030
Su Gwang, you won't be left alone here.

17
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,030
I'll always be by your side.

18
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,900
♫  Do you feel the same as I do?  ♫

19
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,250
Don't go.

20
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,690
What's wrong, Seul Bi?

21
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,820
Don't go, Su Gwang.

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,570
Where would I go?

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,040
Don't worry.

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,770
I'm not going anywhere.

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,850
You're pretty when you sleep, so I've been staring for a while.

26
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,320
Should I go back to sleep then?

27
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,130
No.

28
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,720
You're pretty when you're awake, too.

29
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,380
Yeah!

30
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,290
He went to the market last time and again today?

31
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,090
It doesn't seem like he's there to buy anything.

32
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,500
- What are you doing by yourself? 
 - I can't reach!

33
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,840
Oh, it's because you couldn't reach it?

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,940
Here, hold on to this.

35
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,080
We can just do this.

36
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,790
- Oh, I'm sorry. 
 - Hello.

37
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,640
What can I get you?

38
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,400
Who is that?

39
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,260
I want to eat pickled golbengi today.

40
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,730
Right?

41
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,590
- Could you package one kilogram of prawns for me? 
 - Yes yes.

42
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,750
- We're just going to stop by next door. 
 - Okay!

43
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,280
- Take your time. We'll have it ready. 
 - Okay, thank you.

44
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,070
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

45
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,850
Hey, you've got a knack for this.

46
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,970
It's pretty, right?

47
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,420
Yeah.

48
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,450
But you're prettier.

49
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,210
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

50
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,260
Hello.

51
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,030
What can I get you?

52
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,420
You should take your sunglasses off if you want a good look at the fish

53
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,300
in order to check if they're fresh.

54
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,160
I see.

55
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,270
Please give me one kilogram of prawns.

56
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,370
- I got it. 
 - Thank you.

57
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,770
Prawns, decagonal crustacean lobsters of the shrimp family.

58
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,620
Wow, you're quite the character.

59
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,540
Thank you.

60
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,030
Su Gwang, many, many, many.

61
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,580
- I got it. Many. 
 - Yes.

62
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,950
- Excuse me? 
 - Oh my. Welcome.

63
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,420
Have we seen each other before?

64
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,340
- Are those two from the fish shop over there a couple?
 - Oh my.

65
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,760
You're quite the curious cat.

66
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,380
Those two look really good together, right?

67
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,540
They're currently in a very sweet relationship.

68
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,600
No wonder!

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,540
- Thank you. 
 - Excuse me.

70
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,560
Buy one, please.

71
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,990
- I'll buy three. 
 - Oh my! What a generous eonni!

72
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,240
- Here. 
 - Card.

73
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,400
I just have to swipe.

74
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,190
- Oh, right. Right. That woman has another man. 
 - Oh my, oh my.

75
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,950
Did you know? The man who always comes by the fish shop is a third-generation heir to a chaebol family.

76
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,600
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,260
So heavy!

78
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,500
Oppa, what are you doing?

79
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Where should I put these?

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,900
- What are all these? 
 - Plants... and this and that.

81
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,230
I prefer Venus flytraps or round-leaved sundews,

82
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,550
but I just bought something ordinary because

83
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,620
I had a feeling you'd freak out.

84
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,490
Sure, thanks.

85
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,830
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

86
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,400
Let's do the interview while we eat.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,530
Interview?

88
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,030
Did you forget?

89
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,760
The interview for my web novel.

90
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,150
I'm not making any progress because you keep backing out, so my editor is about to

91
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,700
fry me.

92
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,430
Can't we do it next time?

93
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,930
Do you want to do the interview or marry me?

94
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,630
"The interview!" Was that just for show?

95
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,210
Jang Gyeong, I'm a little busy right now.

96
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,030
We need to get married.

97
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,920
Honey, I'm going to have to beg Father to buy me a purse.

98
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,020
It's delicious, right?

99
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,590
Of course, it is.

100
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,580
I bought it from Seodong Market.

101
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,110
Did you stalk me?

102
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,280
Yes. I stalked you.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,440
Because I was pissed that you blew off my interview.

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,940
So?

105
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,690
What did you discover in Seodong Market?

106
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,600
That the son of a chaebol family has been captivated

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,200
by a woman from a fish shop.

108
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,730
This is an incredible hooking point, Oppa!

109
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,080
I crave more.

110
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,460
When and where did you meet that woman? Huh?

111
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,320
Let's just get married.

112
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,220
Wow.

113
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,300
That's hardcore.

114
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,960
You're willing to go that far to protect this woman?

115
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,860
Yeah.

116
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,100
Jeong Hyeon Tae was released from prison?

117
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,640
Assistant Jeong is out.

118
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,420
Is that so?

119
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,770
I guess you remember him because of past affections?

120
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,640
Not affection.

121
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,460
Guilt.

122
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,970
You could've chosen anyone, and it had to be him?

123
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,900
He's better than a coward like you.

124
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,830
What did you say?

125
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,180
You couldn't do anything because you were so afraid of your father.

126
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,460
You made me a promise that you'd let me go outside,

127
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,690
but you had no intention of keeping it.

128
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,870
That was the best choice I made.

129
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,380
Locking up a witch like you in here.

130
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,290
Because letting you out in the world is more terrifying.

131
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,200
You and your father, Seon Ju Cheol.

132
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,590
Is he still rotting in the mental hospital?

133
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,450
What a long lifeline

134
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,790
after all he's done to my mom.

135
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,410
- Shut up. 
 - You're the same.

136
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,900
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

137
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,070
Shut up!

138
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,790
Let me go, you bastards!

139
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,940
Let me go!

140
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,120
Hey!

141
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,230
Don't look at me like that. Don't look at me like that.

142
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,800
Don't look.

143
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,100
- It's delicious. 
 - Is it?

144
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,330
Say ah.

145
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,620
- It's good. 
 - Is it?

146
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,210
- Wow! 
 - Wow!

147
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,950
- You rolled it so well! 
 - I did really well, right?

148
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,010
You're better than I am.

149
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,260
Here.

150
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,490
Hey.

151
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,510
♫  Sweeter than sunshine  ♫

152
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,340
♫  I’ll dance as I fall into your eyes  ♫

153
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,060
♫  I don’t know why I’m trembling  ♫

154
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,380
♫  The way you look at me is a bit different than usual  ♫

155
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,340
♫  I'm sure you already know  ♫

156
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,190
♫  My heart is filled with you  ♫

157
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,800
♫  It all seems like a lie  ♫

158
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,110
What are you doing?

159
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,150
Praying.

160
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,250
What's praying?

161
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,590
When you want to thank God or ask Him something,

162
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,750
you bring your hands together like this and pray.

163
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,250
I see.

164
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,190
Mr. God, thank you for letting me meet Su Gwang.

165
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,040
Please let us always be together

166
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,880
and meet again if we part ways, and meet again if we part again,

167
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,130
and allow us to love each other our entire lives.

168
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,300
Prayer should be done silently in your head, stupid.

169
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,580
He'll hear me better if I say it out loud.

170
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,810
Thank you!

171
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,760
He'll listen to my prayer.

172
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,280
Su Gwang, hurry up and pray, too.

173
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,070
What are you praying about?

174
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,420
You shouldn't distract people while they're praying.

175
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,500
Say it out loud.

176
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,800
Huh?

177
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,210
Let me know, too.

178
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,200
Do you want to go outside and take a look around?

179
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,470
I'll finish up and leave soon.

180
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,070
♫  It all seems like a lie, fly in the sky  ♫

181
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,450
♫  What do I do when even the wind is so sweet?  ♫

182
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,640
♫  If I could hold your hand  ♫

183
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,800
♫  I believe I could fly anywhere  ♫

184
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,390
What were you doing?

185
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,180
What did you pray about?

186
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,750
It's a secret.

187
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,010
Then this is also a secret.

188
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,750
- What is it? 
 - It's a secret!

189
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,510
- What is it? 
 - It's a secret!

190
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,300
I caught you!

191
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,930
- You really won't tell me? 
 - I won't!

192
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,630
♫  I believe I could fly anywhere  ♫

193
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,990
It's a secret.

194
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,350
Tell me!

195
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,580
This one.

196
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,810
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

197
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,460
What about the number?

198
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,170
♫  I knew it was you  ♫

199
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,260
Number?

200
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,760
Your girlfriend's ring size.

201
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,270
Ah!

202
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,250
If you don't know, you can find out and text us.

203
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,820
- Okay, I understand. 
 - All right.

204
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,670
♫  I'll smile a little more  ♫

205
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,180
Myeong Seong, what brings you to our flower shop?

206
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,240
I need these a few days later, but I can order them ahead of time, right?

207
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,400
Is this for a proposal?

208
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,780

♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please be with me  ♫

209
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,130
Did your delivery go well?

210
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,480
Yeah.

211
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,410
♫  If you hold my hand, I don't mind flying even higher  ♫

212
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,330
Why?

213
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,610
Oh, it's nothing.

214
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,840
Ta-da! Today I hung up "octopus soup."

215
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,980
I'm going to hang up recipes for all the fish here.

216
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,420
Yeah?

217
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,340
I don't think there'll be any more room.

218
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,490
Don't worry. I can do it.

219
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,240
Let's go, let's go!

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

221
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,920
Excuse me!

222
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,350
Do you have something to say to me?

223
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,830
- Never mind. 
 - What is it?

224
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,380
Tell me!

225
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,490
Hurry up!

226
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,700
You know...

227
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,740
Looking at Seul Bi's hand size,

228
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,860
what do you think her ring size is?

229
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,850
You're too cruel.

230
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,360
That's why I wasn't going to ask you.

231
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,590
Size seven!

232
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,540
Thank you!

233
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,950
Lucky seven.

234
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,150
Seven.

235
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,300
Okay!

236
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,940
Seven. Oh my gosh.

237
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,250
Oh, you're here?

238
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,260
I finished the deliveries for all six locations.

239
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,180
You did great!

240
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,710
Please go in and get some rest.

241
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,860
How is it lucky seven!

242
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,670
Size seven.

243
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,500
It's like he's doing a photoshoot even when he's holding fish.

244
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,040
How attractive.

245
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,150
Looking straight ahead and not turning back

246
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,020
was my dating philosophy,

247
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,370
but what do I do now?

248
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,610
Why does my bare finger look so sad?

249
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,780
Maintain frying oil temperature between 170°C and 180°C.

250
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,110
Noona.

251
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,720
What?

252
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,670
What type of oil is this?

253
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,140
That's waste oil.

254
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,520
Look at the one next to it. Canola oil.

255
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,710
Hey.

256
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,770
Shouldn't you be in the library? What are you doing here?

257
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,040
I've chosen my career path, Mom.

258
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,100
I told you not to set a career path.

259
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,590
There's no need to set one.

260
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,450
You just need to submit your application according to your SAT score.

261
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,240
No, I won't go to college. I'll run a chicken restaurant.

262
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,780
There's no chicken major in college, Mom.

263
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,430
- You! 
 - Mom, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts!

264
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,950
- You'll do anything to avoid studying. 
 - It hurts.

265
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,250
Hurry up and go to the library. Hurry.

266
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,670
Working at a major company after college, you still run a chicken place.

267
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,820
Retire as a civil servant, you end up with a chicken place.

268
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,130
The end result of life is always a chicken place.

269
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,860
I just want to inherit this chicken restaurant early on

270
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,370
and become the BTS of chicken restaurants.

271
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,800
Hey! I'm your noona.

272
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,160
What makes you think you'll inherit the chicken restaurant?

273
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,080
Noona, you can just get married to him and run the fish shop.

274
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,530
I would if I could.

275
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,680
You two are driving me crazy!

276
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,010
- Please come again. 
 - Thank you.

277
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,080
Myeong Seong.

278
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,420
Ajussi!

279
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,070
What brings you all the way here?

280
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,560
Hey, you. I came to check and see if you're still alive

281
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,620
since you haven't shown your face in a while.

282
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,250
I would've gone to pick you up if you had contacted me beforehand.

283
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,710
- What is this? 
 - I brought some flatfish.

284
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,230
You should put some ice in here.

285
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,740
Saltwater fish of the flounder family.

286
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,460
Nice to meet you, Flatfish.

287
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,760
Hello.

288
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,610
Oh, this is my girlfriend.

289
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,100
Aigoo, such a pretty girlfriend.

290
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,200
I've told you before, right?

291
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,500
He's Mr. Go, the man who helped me through a tough time.

292
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,630
- Oh! Hello. 
 - Yes, nice to meet you.

293
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,790
Oh, this is our new employee, Mr. Jeong.

294
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,420
This is my father.

295
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,130
Father?

296
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,250
You're not just going to leave, right?

297
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,070
Let's have a delicious dinner later.

298
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,200
Let's eat something delicious.

299
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,430
No, no. It's going to rain later, so I should get going now.

300
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,510
I saw your face, so I'm good.

301
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,850
- Why are you just leaving? 
 - It's fine. It's fine.

302
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,140
Father, we should go eat something delicious together.

303
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,340
 You...

304
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,580
 Why are you here?

305
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,040
 Hurry and get out of here!

306
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,540
 Mom, do I have a dad too?

307
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,870
 Of course.

308
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,110
 Seul Bi, you also have a dad.

309
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,770
 Where is he right now?

310
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,820
 In the outside world.

311
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,410
 Do you love Dad?

312
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,730
 Well...

313
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,730
 You don't love him?

314
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,850
 For me,

315
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,940
 loving your dad

316
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,670
 is the most difficult thing in the world.

317
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,200
 Why is loving Dad difficult?

318
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,950
 In this world,

319
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,410
 some people view love as trivial and insignificant.

320
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,250
 Those types of people

321
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,100
 will only manipulate us for their success.

322
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,970
 So...

323
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,000
 You need to be able to tell

324
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,890
 who is trying to manipulate us,

325
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,970
 and who really loves us.

326
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,540
Why?

327
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,270
Why did you call me here?

328
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,020
Hey, Jeong Hyeon Tae.

329
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,230
Why are you next to my son?

330
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,140
I didn't know he was your son.

331
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,520
What are you scheming here?

332
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,710
Why did you come?

333
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,410
What do you mean, why?

334
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,380
Didn't you see that necklace?

335
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,420
Then that's...

336
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,810
She's...

337
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,530
my daughter.

338
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,700
What?

339
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,370
How did my daughter get involved with your son?

340
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,770
Don't you dare mess with my son.

341
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,670
I won't sit back and watch!

342
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,700
And if you won't?

343
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,450
I'm not the same guy from 20 years ago.

344
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,620
Do you know who has my back?

345
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,550
It'll also be the end of you if you mess with me.

346
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,410
Who has your back?

347
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,780
Who sent you after my son?

348
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,120
Seon Il Jung!

349
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,340
Seon Il Jung?

350
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,440
That's right.

351
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,990
So tell your son to stay away from my daughter.

352
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,050
Or your son will die!

353
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,960
Seon Il Jung.

354
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,110
Mr. Wang?

355
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,570
Why?

356
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,150
Don't you know who I am?

357
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,920
Of course, I do. Boss totally adores you.

358
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,390
Then you shouldn't be hitting on me like this.

359
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,890
Of course, I shouldn't.

360
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,000
Sh*t.

361
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,330
What do you want?

362
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,820
Who's the VIP?

363
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,460
How should I know?

364
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,950
Then I guess I should send this to Boss.

365
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,970
- Hey, you should hit send. 
 - I really don't know.

366
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,840
Then find out.

367
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,700
You have access to Boss's documents and phone.

368
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,140
And I'm dead if I get caught in the process.

369
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,400
No, no. You're dead even if you can't find out.

370
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,330
Seriously.

371
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,250
Hey, I'll give you exactly three days.

372
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,590
I just ought to!

373
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,520
I'm going to kill him.

374
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,550
I think she's in Seodong-gu.

375
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,630
When you find her, take her to the Cheongpyeong Villa for now.

376
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,670
I'll go meet her.

377
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,270
Will do.

378
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,080
It's a list of investors to replace Saliha Group.

379
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,160
You can get in touch with those from Hong Kong and Singapore.

380
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,340
They want to meet you directly.

381
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,950
You said you'll prove your ability even without the help of the predictions.

382
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,340
Give me some time.

383
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,130
There's a timing to show your abilities.

384
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,940
If you miss the timing, the opportunity will pass you by.

385
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,250
Was there ever a time I disappointed you

386
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,450
even when your expectations were high?

387
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:54,190
I don't know how much longer I need to adjust to your standards.

388
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,320
My standards!

389
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,010
No.

390
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,870
My standard is for you to become the head of a large corporation.

391
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,250
Have you arrived?

392
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,620
Search every store within the market.

393
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,050
Don't miss a single place.

394
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,640
All right.

395
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,600
- Thank you. Please come again. 
 - Okay, take care.

396
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,660
- Myeong Seong's lady! 
 - Yes?

397
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,600
- Give me two cutlassfish.
 - Okay.

398
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,610
I didn't order any golbengi.

399
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,350
You called me Myeong Seong's lady,

400
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,290
so I'm giving you this on the house.

401
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,540
Is that so?

402
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,490
Then I guess I need to call you that until you get sick and tired of it.

403
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,630
- Myeong Seong's lady. 
 - Yes.

404
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,130
- Myeong Seong's lady. 
 - Yes!

405
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,130
Okay.

406
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,740
 Extra fish if you call for Myeong Seong's lady.

407
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,240
 Extra fish if you call for Myeong Seong's lady.

408
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,970
Ma'am?

409
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,110
Pretty ma'am?

410
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,360
Me?

411
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,500
As expected, you're aware of your beauty.

412
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,240
Please listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

413
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,850
In the 20 years of my life as a shaman,

414
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:42,100
I think it's a heavenly blessing that I was able to meet someone like you.

415
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,330
Which brings me to ask,

416
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,230
could you just pass on a small portion of those skills to me?

417
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,320
I will do my best—

418
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,020
I don't want to.

419
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,610
I knew you'd say that.

420
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,900
As expected, how charismatic of you, ma'am.

421
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,520
I beg of you just this once.

422
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm not ma'am. I'm Myeong Seong's lady.

423
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,090
Myeong Seong's lady!

424
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,210
Ma'am, please save me just this once. Please?

425
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,790
Just once. Please?

426
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,100
Seul Bi.

427
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,140
What do you need?

428
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,420
When did you put this up? It's embarrassing.

429
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,110
So what?

430
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:25,780
Oh, then Su Gwang, should we call you Seul Bi's husband?

431
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,740
What?

432
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,440
You like that, right? Right?

433
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,170
God of Heaven and Earth...

434
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,350
Jade Emperor Sangjenim, Maitreya Bodhisattva. Om Mani Banme Hum.

435
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,670
- Don't touch him! 
 - What in the world.

436
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,920
A pure soul like this really exists.

437
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,330
Oh, I can't open my eyes.

438
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,580
Whoa, whoa.

439
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,130
Are you going to buy fish or not?

440
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,960
If you're not, then please leave.

441
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,070
I'll buy some. With those pure hands,

442
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,910
if you could catch me a codfish,

443
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,550
I'll be able to cook up a mean codfish stew.

444
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,120
Ma'am, ma'am. I don't know what your relationship with him is, but...

445
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,360
What on earth.

446
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,090
Go to the opposite end.

447
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,670
Go over there.

448
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,410
Excuse me. Excuse me.

449
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,300
Hold on.

450
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,840
I'm the head of the market.

451
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,390
Are you all here to make a joint purchase?

452
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,270
Have you seen a woman like this?

453
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,820
No!

454
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,670
- But who is this woman? 
 - That's none of your business.

455
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,550
These punks coming in swarms...

456
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,510
They're here. They've come.

457
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,920
The arranged marriage partner...

458
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,870
The chaebol family sent those men for sure.

459
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,830
Hey, Yeong Wu. Yeong Wu.

460
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,410
You must hurry and go find Seul Bi Noona,

461
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,610
and tell her that the bad guys are here to catch her.

462
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,090
Bad guys. Bad guys!

463
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,920
Ms. Smile!

464
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,350
Big trouble. There's big trouble!

465
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,430
The bad guys are here. The bad guys are here.

466
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,700
- Yeong Wu, what's wrong? 
 - What's wrong all of a sudden?

467
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,450
The bad guys are here to catch Seul Bi Noona!

468
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,190
There's big trouble.

469
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,320
- Yes, welcome. 
 - Ajumma.

470
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,280
Have you seen this woman before?

471
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,080
Isn't she a bar girl?

472
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,690
My husband no longer goes to the Arizona Club!

473
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,350
Are you from there?

474
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,960
- I said, are you from there? 
 - Never mind!

475
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,620
- Have you seen— 
 - Aigoo!

476
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,690
Aigoo, what to do?

477
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,360
What should we do?

478
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,620
Aigoo, what should we do? Oh my gosh!

479
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,280
- Oh, I'm so sorry! 
 - Are you all right?

480
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,330
- I've never seen her. 
 - You should at least try this. This is really delicious.

481
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,790
You're all wet. All wet.

482
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,410
Anybody there?

483
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,930
Director Seon!

484
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,500
- Have you found her? 
 - Not yet.

485
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,480
Please look some more over there.

486
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,650
Have you ever seen this woman?

487
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,370
Of course, I have!

488
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,540
Where have you seen her?

489
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,230
"Men in Crisis!" She's the actress from that drama.

490
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,140
That weekend drama. Oh, never mind. It's a daily drama.

491
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,320
You people are still here?

492
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,380
The merchants are all throwing a fit because you're disrupting their business!

493
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,900
You're not even buying anything. You're just stirring up trouble!

494
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,770
- With whose permission? 
 - We received a report.

495
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,370
You're here! These are the people.

496
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,670
I heard that you all swarmed in here

497
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,300
and disrupted their businesses.

498
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,550
What are you doing here?

499
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,820
We're looking for a missing person.

500
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,570
Have you filed a missing persons report?

501
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,400
No. We're searching by ourselves due to personal circumstances.

502
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,570
Who's the missing person?

503
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,540
That's not something we can disclose.

504
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,730
You haven't filed a missing persons report,

505
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,160
you can't disclose the missing person's identity to the police,

506
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,840
and you're disrupting business here in the market.

507
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,280
What is this?

508
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,820
- This is very suspicious. 
 - Show us your ID and give me your contact number.

509
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,270
Let's go.

510
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,080
- Where are you going? 
 - Where are you going?

511
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,910
- Excuse me! 
 - Hey!

512
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,650
Hold on.

513
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,210
We might need to contact you in the future, so please give us your cooperation—

514
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,670
Come on.

515
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,720
We'll give it to you later.

516
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,800
Excuse me! I said come here.

517
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,500
My acting was so good. I was so nervous!

518
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,630
Me too.

519
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,640
Seul Bi.

520
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,610
You know Min Joon, right?

521
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,130
The people who came looking for you at the market

522
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,930
are from Geumhwa Hotel.

523
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,240
Two years ago, I first met you at Geumhwa Hotel.

524
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,930
When I took you back,

525
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,810
Chairman Seon Sam Joong became furious,

526
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,300
and my hard-earned entry into Geumhwa Group was canceled.

527
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,950
What's your relationship with Geumhwa Group?

528
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,280
Now, tell me honestly.

529
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,440
I need to know.

530
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,920
Su Gwang.

531
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,150
Su Gwang!

532
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,310
If you're speaking the truth...

533
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,600
if you've been imprisoned all your life because of your ability,

534
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,370
that means my mom also died because of that.

535
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,730
Two years ago, on the day we first met...

536
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,360
 Mom!

537
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,030
My mom had an accident,

538
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,970
and someone tried to kill me.

539
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,610
Su Gwang.

540
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,170
 Director Seon Min Joon

541
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,950
Yes, Su Gwang.

542
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,310
What?

543
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,150
Hotel?

544
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,160
You came here?

545
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,380
Bring Chairman Seon Sam Joong here!

546
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,030
Where's Chairman Seon Sam Joong?

547
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,950
Gong Su Gwang.

548
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,180
Let's have a talk.

549
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,910
You may leave.

550
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,560
Hey, Seon Min Joon.

551
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,970
You knew about everything, too.

552
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,140
The things your father did...

553
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,810
You were aware of them all.

554
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,400
I don't know what you're talking about, but—

555
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,100
He imprisoned someone,

556
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,480
kidnapped someone who ran away,

557
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,130
and killed someone so that he wouldn't get caught.

558
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,080
Is Geumhwa Group a criminal organization?

559
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,930
- Huh? 
 - Su Gwang!

560
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,960
Let's go up.

561
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,700
You...

562
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,120
You...

563
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,980
That's right.

564
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,850
Gong Su Gwang.

565
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,850
You were alive.

566
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,170
You were alive.

567
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,030
My mother's death

568
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,370
was your doing, right?

569
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,060
It was really you.

570
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,850
You wouldn't do that...

571
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,890
Is that possible?

572
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,340
You're my friend's father

573
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,490
and you acknowledged and supported me.

574
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,080
I considered you a father figure.

575
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,880
There's no way you'd do this to me.

576
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,750
I thought it over tens, hundreds, thousands of times!

577
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,270
That it couldn't be you.

578
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,510
But it really was you.

579
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,380
And the reason was because of Seul Bi?

580
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,220
Are you even human?

581
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,020
Su Gwang, what you know isn't the truth—

582
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,610
The things you guys have done...

583
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,420
I'm going to tell the entire world.

584
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,950
I'm going to make sure you guys are punished!

585
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,390
Don't ever come looking for Seul Bi again.

586
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,320
Gong Su Gwang!

587
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,480
Seul Bi is my woman.

588
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,610
What?

589
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,370
She's been my woman before she even met you.

590
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:43,360
You're calling her your woman when you've been imprisoning her?

591
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,700
We were protecting her.

592
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,350
You're sickening, Seon Min Joon.

593
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,560
Su Gwang,

594
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,930
what do you think will happen when the world finds out about Seul Bi?

595
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,880
People will enjoy themselves and want to see her and witness her.

596
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,660
And those who can't have her will want to get rid of her.

597
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,790
Don't you think that's what'll happen?

598
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,280
Gong Su Gwang.

599
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,180
I wasn't even aware that he was alive.

600
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,310
Is what Su Gwang said true?

601
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,160
That you killed Su Gwang's mother

602
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,990
and tried to kill him, too?

603
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,360
No.

604
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,920
No?

605
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,600
That's right.

606
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,870
It wasn't my doing.

607
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:51,740
Then, why couldn't you say anything earlier?

608
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,970
Why did you let him misunderstand?

609
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,330
Is it that important?

610
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,260
Then what's important?

611
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,310
Father.

612
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,590
Father.

613
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,660
Father!

614
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,710
Why did you

615
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,280
come to me?

616
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,380
Su Gwang.

617
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,040
My mom

618
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,830
passed away because of your ability.

619
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,380
How could you come to me?

620
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,670
Su Gwang, I'm sorry.

621
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,970
It's not your fault.

622
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,930
Don't go!

623
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,740
Don't go, Su Gwang.

624
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:27,200
♫  On a sunny day with the warm light, suddenly  ♫

625
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:42,900
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

626
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:51,660
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

627
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,760
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

628
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:05,800
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

629
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:12,940
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

630
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:20,500
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

631
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:26,790
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

632
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,120
Gong Su Gwang.

633
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,600
He's been alive all this time.

634
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,320
♫  Because I know I can’t let go easily  ♫

635
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,610
You knew this, didn't you?

♫  I guess I’ve been waiting for you all day  ♫

637
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,360
He was alive.

♫  I want to tell you not to come back  ♫

639
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,670
 You're calling her your woman when you've been imprisoning her?

640
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,980
 You're sickening, Seon Min Joon.

641
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:08,680
♫  I’m afraid you’ll disappear without saying a thing  ♫

You're here.

644
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,760
You are here.

645
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,190
Come to us.

646
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,940
Come over to our side.

647
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,230
Or should we go over there?

648
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,040
Father.

649
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:39,400
Kill that witch.

650
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,320
That's how we'll escape from this.

651
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,300
She's a witch.

652
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,690
 Mi Su.

653
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,810
 Mi Su!

654
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,940
 Put down the gun. Put the gun down, Mi Su!

655
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,520
 No.

656
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,330
 That man needs to die.

657
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,190
 I'm going to kill him with my own hands!

658
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,370
 No!

659
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,930
 Mom.

660
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,160
 Mi Su.

661
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,950
 Mom.

662
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,580
 Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

663
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,080
 Mi...

664
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,270
 Mom, open your eyes.

665
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,160
 Mom.

666
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,990
 Mom.

667
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,390
 Mom!

668
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,860
 Mom!

669
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,090
 Mom.

670
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,840
They used us

671
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,840
to get to us.

672
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:15,370
You must kill that witch.

673
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,770
Chairman! Are you okay?

674
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,090
Let's go.

675
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,320
I expected you to come with Chairman. What brings you here alone?

676
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,640
I want to see some medical records.

677
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,890
Chairman Seon keeps an eye on your grandfather's records.

678
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,440
No, not Grandfather's.

679
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Father's medical records.

680
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,800
- That's... 
 - Since I'm his guardian.

681
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,120
Su Gwang!

682
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,480
Isn't this place too small?

683
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:03,140
It's way more spacious than that place.

684
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,200
I can go outside whenever I want to.

685
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,230
You're all grown up.

686
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,460
Thank you for raising me.

687
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,200
You even know how to say that.

688
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,870
Move somewhere Min Joon can't find you.

689
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,640
I'll arrange a house for you.

690
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,710
I don't need your help anymore.

691
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,700
You shouldn't be here.

692
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,770
You're aware of what will happen

693
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,260
the more people you meet, right?

694
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:41,500
I'm going to become someone ordinary.

695
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,130
Will Su Gwang let you stay by his side even after seeing what you really are?

696
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,290
Your mom wouldn't have lived her entire life like that

697
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:52,560
if becoming an ordinary person was that easy.

698
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,660
I'll send someone

699
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,040
once a house is arranged.

700
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,790
Please let me meet Mom.

701
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,410
I'll think about it

702
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,730
if you move to the new place.

703
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,230
Myeong Seong,

704
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,940
the flowers you ordered last time are ready.

705
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,540
Wow, Brother-in-law.

706
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,490
They're so pretty.

707
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,730
I guess it's true that he's going to propose.

708
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,470
Hey, I guess you can catch the bouquet.

709
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,730
Eonni, seriously!

710
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,500
How much was that?

711
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,510
A hundred thousand won (~$100).

712
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,260
Overconsumption.

713
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,710
What's with this bullsh*t again?

714
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,230
Whatever!

715
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,020
Noona. Noona, Noona!

716
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,190
Are the fish shop ajussi and Seul Bi Noona getting married?

717
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,500
I don't know!

718
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,830
You have to marry Myeong Seong Ajussi, so I can have this chicken restaurant.

719
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,060
Hey, you little punk!

720
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,450
Do you think I work myself to the bone

721
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,410
in order to send you to school just for you to end up in a chicken place?

722
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,800
What's wrong with a chicken restaurant?

723
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,830
Have some pride in your occupation.

724
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,780
Do you know how much I respect you for frying delicious chicken?

725
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,400
- You respect me? 
 - Yes.

726
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,960
My homeroom teacher said how difficult it is

727
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,910
to stick to one thing that we're good at.

728
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,590
But you're good at two jobs.

729
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,110
Two?

730
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,660
Chicken and what else?

731
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,740
Raising us this well?

732
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,270
Eun Su!

733
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,840
Hey! Stop trying to take over this chicken restaurant

734
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,540
with your random touching remarks.

735
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,910
Just go and study, you little brat.

736
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,470
Children?

737
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,590
Eighty percent of this chicken restaurant is loans.

738
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,100
I'm going to the library.

739
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,910
Son! I was still touched by your words.

740
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,870
Where did I leave my government employment exam?

741
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,480
 Seodong Market

742
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,750
Seul Bi!

743
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,360
Hello.

744
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,560
You got home safely last night, right?

745
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,450
Hello.

746
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,250
Look at you being shy.

747
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,260
How cute.

748
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,280
You must be an introvert.

749
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,830
Myeong Seong's lady.

750
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,800
Oh, you're also here.

751
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,050
Here.

752
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,240
I made some sandwiches for the two of you.

753
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,650
It looks good.

754
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,090
Thank you.

755
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,380
Seul Bi!

756
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,470
Seul Bi! Here are couples t-shirts.

757
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,170
Looking at other wedding photos, I realized that

758
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,920
something casual like this is essential.

759
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,240
Wedding photos?

760
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,560
The commemorative photos taken before a wedding.

761
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,290
You really don't know anything.

762
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,110
She can just learn one thing at a time.

763
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,870
We'll wear it well. Thank you.

764
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,940
Seul Bi! Everyone's gathered here.

765
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,010
- Here you go. 
 - What is this, Eonni?

766
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:05,020
It's a couple cactus.

767
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,890
This is Myeong Seong, and this is Seul Bi.

768
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,380
- They're apparently very fertile. 
 - Thank you.

769
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,540
Tell me if you need a wedding hall!

770
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,260
I'll introduce you to someplace nice.

771
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,310
Then I guess our head of the market, Mr. Park, will have to be the officiant.

772
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,860
Does that mean I should buy a suit?

773
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,210
Right!

774
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,980
Everyone, stop.

775
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,380
I'm sorry, but

776
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,330
the two of us need to talk.

777
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,030
- Oh, of course you should. 
 - Sure, go ahead.

778
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,870
Go ahead and talk.

779
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,000
Stop coming out to the market.

780
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,530
- Su Gwang. 
 - I need time to think.

781
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:51,950
It's hard for me to see your face.

782
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,510
Su Gwang, I'll do better.

783
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,010
That's not what I mean.

784
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,800
It's my fault.

785
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,860
It's not your fault.

786
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,870
I'm not saying that it's your fault. Can you...

787
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,570
just please leave?

788
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,180
Su Gwang, I hate you.

789
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,870
Seul Bi. Why?

790
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,540
Oh my.

791
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,650
What's wrong?

792
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,680
Let's go.

793
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,220
Wait.

794
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,460
You two must have fought,

795
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,700
but how could you make a woman cry?

796
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,270
What are you doing? Go after her!

797
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,850
Yeah, don't trust him.

798
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,180
Men are ships, and women are harbor. That's how it is. 
  (TN: A line from a song)

799
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,570
Brother-in-law Go Myeong Seong.

800
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:55,840
You told Seul Bi that you don't want to see her face? Go away?

801
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,940
What's wrong with you?

802
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,560
That's right. You live together

803
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,380
and you even promised to get married.

804
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:05,540
How could you push her away in front of all the market people like this?

805
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,410
Exactly, Myeong Seong. That's not right.

806
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,970
Whose side am I on?

807
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,100
Let's go.

808
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,300
I'm not going back.

809
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,860
Don't go.

810
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,510
I'm not asking you to go back there.

811
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,880
Come back to our house for now.

812
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,140
Oh my.

813
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,940
Our house?

814
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,410
Okay.

815
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,060
Oh my, hold on.

816
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,050
A woman needs to play hard-to-get,

817
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,940
but you're going too straight ahead.

818
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,310
Oh my.

819
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:46,420
 Fried Chicken

820
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,140
Yes.

821
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,940
 How did it go?

822
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,480
Hold your horses.

823
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,290
It's pretty serious here.

824
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:06,160
 What do you mean serious?

825
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,970
I'll— I'll call you back later.

826
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,160
Geez.

827
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,180
What's so serious?

828
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,810
I don't know.

829
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,770
You're telling me to wait when I don't know what's going on? Huh?

830
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:27,110
That bastard's doing that, so he can negotiate and get more money from us!

831
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:32,110
If the Geumhwa Search team came and went, that means Sam Joong knows everything!

832
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,980
How can I wait!

833
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,410
After the search team came by, the police are on high alert,

834
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,690
so I think it'd be wise to wait for now.

835
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,490
Geez.

836
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,100
You bought these for me?

837
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,140
No.

838
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,160
You did.

839
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,170
- Give them to me now. 
 - I said I didn't.

840
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,720
It's just right.

841
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,150
It's pretty.

842
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,200
Thank you, Su Gwang.

843
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,610
What are you doing?

844
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,520
Pack your things.

845
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,510
I'm not going back.

846
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,270
Whether it's a one-room or a studio, I'll arrange a temporary place for you.

847
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:20,540
You don't need to return to Geumhwa Group if you don't want to.

848
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:24,790
I'll come back after finding a place.

849
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,540
I don't need one.

850
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,700
Seul Bi.

851
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,120
Staying here together is not an option.

852
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,670
I don't need any other place!

853
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,190
Pack your belongings.

854
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,910
Su Gwang!

855
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,450
That woman...

856
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,320
That woman.

857
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,160
Su Gwang!

858
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,580
That woman...

859
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,510
You must meet her.

860
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,000
You must meet her!

861
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,040
The woman who comes looking for Gong Su Gwang, not Go Myeong Seong.

862
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,130
I knew it when I saw you at the market.

863
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,480
It's over there.

864
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,120
It was built two years ago

865
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,430
and it's a new building,

866
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:40,950
so the interior is perfect for a honeymoon couple.

867
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,300
It's pretty nice.

868
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,040
- A honeymoon house? 
 - Yeah!

869
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,010
Myeong Seong was going around looking for places with realtor Mr. Kim.

870
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,330
What the heck? Then that was a lover's quarrel?

871
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,900
I worried for no reason.

872
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,450
Exactly.

873
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,150
Newlyweds, how lucky!

874
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,810
Then are they moving out of our rooftop?

875
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,470
They can just use that as a honeymoon house.

876
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,690
- Gosh, come on! 
 - Gosh, that scared me!

877
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,940
So annoying!

878
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,760
This is your chance. The time is now. Hurry!

879
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,390
Eun Joong!

880
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:14,980
Move.

881
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,470
Whoa, what in the world?

882
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,470
Seul Bi.

883
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,640
Seul Bi!

884
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,330
Seul Bi!

885
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,210
Seul Bi!

886
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,200
Seul Bi!

887
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,400
Hey, Myeong Seong. What's up?

888
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,240
Miss Seul Bi?

889
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,710
I didn't see Miss Seul Bi today.

890
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,950
Never mind, Hyeong. It's nothing.

891
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,120
I'll call you later.

892
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,760
Where are you, Seul Bi?

893
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,280
Mr. Wang!

894
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,620
Mr. Wang!

895
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,070
Seul Bi!

896
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,190
Seul Bi!

897
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:11,800
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

898
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,750
Seul Bi!

899
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:21,700
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

900
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,930
 But I

901
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:27,330
 resent myself for bringing you home

902
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,560
 that night.

903
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:38,500
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

904
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:45,610
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

905
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:53,160
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

906
01:00:53,160 --> 01:01:03,420
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

907
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:09,160
♫  Because I know I can’t let go easily  ♫

908
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,070
 Jinxed at First

909
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,180
 Let go of me!

910
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,740
 You can see the future, but what happened that day?

911
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,360
 Why didn't you do anything? Why?

912
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,520
 Su Gwang.

913
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,450
 I saw that you've been receiving psychiatric treatment for a long time, Father.

914
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:23,620
 Seul Bi isn't a witch.

915
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,160
 - That woman went back to the hotel. 
 - Hey!

916
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,210
 I told you just to pretend to look. Why did you catch her?

917
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,660
 I didn't catch her.

918
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,270
 - She returned on her own. 
 - On her own?

919
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,570
 Myeong Seong, you're here?

920
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:38,760
 Starting today, I'm Gong Su Gwang.
