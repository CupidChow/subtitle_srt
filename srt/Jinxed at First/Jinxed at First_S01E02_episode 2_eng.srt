1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:12,010

2
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,580
 It's my prince.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,870
No.

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,740
No.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,880
 Episode 2

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,600
Get away. Get away from me, this unlucky dream!

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,110
Every time I dream of her, something bad happens as a triple combo.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,640
Oh, look at my goosebumps.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, goosebumps.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,880
Go away.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,010
Go away.

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,930
Go away.

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,860
What's going on?

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,980
Is something worse coming my way today?

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,890
Myeong Seong.

16
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,240
Hello.

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,210
Don't come closer to me.

18
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,700
Are you going to your store right now?

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,390
I'm also working as a part-timer at my mom's store from today.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,370
I told you not to talk to Myeong Seong! Why don't you listen to me?

21
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,760
Mom, we live upstairs and downstairs.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,290
We should say hello.

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,820
Even on the day you took the civil service exam,

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,550
you talked to Myeong Seong, and then you failed.

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,760
Mom, why is it his fault?

26
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,000
It's my fault for not studying.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,630
Geez! That's nothing to brag about!

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,640
Anyway, don't talk to him and don't even stand next to him!

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,900
- Come inside, b*tch! 
 - No, no, no.

30
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,190
She doesn't need to. I was going to avoid her even if she came next to me.

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,360
Myeong Seong! Myeong Seong...

32
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,000
Why does that offend me?

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,610
Who the hell does he think he is to avoid my daughter?

34
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,690
I'm not going to get a flat tire today, am I?

35
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,000
Are the brakes okay?

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,530
I think something special is going to happen today.

37
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,200
Mom, are you okay?

38
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,700
Hurry up and leave, Seul Bi.

39
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,040
- Mom, I'll justâ€”  
 - You must go, Seul Bi.

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,550
Don't worry and leave.

41
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,910
For my sake.

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,000
You can do it, right Seul Bi?

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,570
Raise this. Hurry!

44
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,130
Come on! Hurry! Oh my!

45
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,580
- Go, go. 
 - Hurry up!

46
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,510
Hurry up!

47
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,920
I love you.

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,310
I love you, Mom.

49
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,960
Go!

50
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,280
What are you doing? Hurry! Go!

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,600
What should I do? Ms. Mi Su! Oh no!

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,170
Oh no! Ms. Mi Su!

53
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,590
Are you okay, Ms. Mi Su?

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,320
Come on! Hold her, hold her!

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,930
Oh, there! There!

56
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,160
Welcome!

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,320
Watch your step.

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,930
Get on the bus carefully.

59
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,020
Be careful.

60
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,810
Be careful.

61
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,660
Next.

62
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,070
Oh, wait a minute! What are you doing?

63
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,660
Hurry up and get on the bus.

64
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,970
Hurry!

65
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,520
Miss, where are you going?

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,670
- Gong Su Gwang! 
 - Gong...

67
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,600
Gong Su Gwang? I've never heard of that place.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,990
Oh, Lucky Fish Shop!

69
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,910
I see. Okay.

70
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,990
What neighborhood is it in?

71
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,590
There's an amusement park near the shop.

72
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,700
You can take a bus from here, too.

73
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,600
Okay, okay. Let's just go to the Lucky Fish Shop.

74
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,210
 Lucky Fish Shop

75
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,050
Myeong Seong!

76
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,700
Yes, President Park. Is there something you want me to do?

77
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,970
Since I'm the merchant association president for this Seodong Market,

78
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,720
I have a duty to listen to the needs of the market traders.

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,350
- Yes, that's right. 
 - Right?

80
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,380
When are you going to move out of your store?

81
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,750
I'm not going to move out.

82
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,020
Why not?

83
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,610
The owner of the building is asking you to move out!

84
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,940
I still have a year left on the contract.

85
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,750
That's true.

86
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,510
But those people are bugging me.

87
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,120
I won't leave until the end of the contract!

88
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,020
I'll stick around right here.

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,820
Who the hell are you?

90
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,910
You are determined to destroy our Seodong Market.

91
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,230
Ever since you came, nothing has worked out for our market!

92
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,070
Am I right?

93
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,030
- You're right. 
 - Right, right.

94
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,010
Look, after you caused the power outage in the spring,

95
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,650
all the food in everyone's stores went bad!

96
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,760
After that, the number of customers was cut in half.

97
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,570
- You know that project, right? 
 - Yeah.

98
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,670
- The remodeling project. 
 - Yeah!

99
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,970
That remodeling project, which was going extremely well,

100
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,900
was canceled for no reason.

101
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,520
You're nothing but a nuisance. You should volunteer to leave on your own.

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,630
How is that...

103
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,400
I guess that could've been my fault...

104
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,950
But if you look at it another way, isn't the objective proof of those being my fault a little weak?

105
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,040
Wow! You're shameless!

106
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,330
Don't you even feel bad about it?

107
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,630
In the case of the remodeling project, the developer was bad.

108
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,750
Wait, what's wrong with you?

109
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,690
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.

110
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,840
I will do better from now on!

111
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,670
No, no. Don't laugh! Don't laugh!

112
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,500
If you laugh, something worse will happen.

113
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,100
- No, no. I'll do better. I will. 
 - No, no!

114
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,500
Hey, don't laugh!

115
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,090
I said, don't laugh!

116
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,860
It's true that you bring bad luck, Myeong Seong!

117
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,980
Did I even bring on the rain?

118
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,450
Am I a goblin or something?

119
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,000
Make it sunny! Zippety zap!

120
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,550
 Lucky Fish Shop

121
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,400
It's good to see you, Gong Su Gwang.

122
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:12,140
I knew something was coming toward me today.

123
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,120
Did you know I was coming?

124
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,590
Yeah.

125
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,320
No, I mean...

126
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,560
Why are you here?

127
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm here to see you, Su Gwang.

128
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,520
Why?

129
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,060
If you don't have anything to say, just go.

130
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,000
I have nowhere to go.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,110
I don't remember anything.

132
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,210
I came to Korea for the first time in a while.

133
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,040
After waking up from an accident,

134
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,700
I couldn't even get in touch with my mom.

135
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,270
The only thing I remember in Korea is you, Su Gwang.

136
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,930
You don't remember anything else but me?

137
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,050
Does that make sense?

138
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,730
Miss!

139
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,420
You can't just leave without paying the taxi fare!

140
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,750
- Taxi fare? 
 - Right, give me the taxi fare.

141
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,040
What?

142
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,960
No, not this.

143
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,620
Don't you have cash or a card?

144
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,580
I don't have any...

145
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,090
What the hell is...

146
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,880
Excuse me. Do you know her?

147
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,080
How much is the taxi fare?

148
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,250
- 150,000 won. 
 - 15...

149
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,870
Wait, how dare you try to scam me, ahjussi?

150
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,010
How much do you have to inflate the cost to charge her 150,000 won?

151
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,640
Did she ride from Gangwon-do or something?

152
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,300
How can you say that I'm scamming you?

153
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,410
This young lady was looking for the Lucky Fish Shop,

154
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,770
so I searched everywhere in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do Province.

155
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,250
This is... one, two, three, four...

156
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,870
It's the ninth store! Ninth!

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,220
Sh*t? Sh*t?

158
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,330
D*mn it!

159
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,170
My goodness!

160
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,640
- Su Gwang. 
 - You've got the wrong person.

161
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,010
My name is Go Myeong Seong.

162
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,500
We don't know each other.

163
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,250
Su Gwang!

164
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,180
You're the only person I know.

165
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,170
Wait. Did Myeong Seong have a girl?

166
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,620
She's pretty.

167
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,530
I'll admit it.

168
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,570
She looks classy, so she must be a daughter from a rich family.

169
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,400
How did she get involved with Myeong Seong?

170
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,410
In this case...

171
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,410
Why are you meddling?

172
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,020
Myeong Seong!

173
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,200
I'm not moving out, President Park!

174
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,190
Don't leave her outside. Fight inside.

175
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,170
Why can't you speak up?

176
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,610
Excuse me. Please give me three mackerels.

177
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,940
Oh, yes. Welcome.

178
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,490
- Three mackerels? 
 - Yes.

179
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,620
Okay!

180
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,110
Excuse me, step aside.

181
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,560
Buy Spanish mackerels, not mackerels.

182
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,170
She is allergic to mackerel.

183
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,740
What is she talking about?

184
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,420
- How much are they? 
 - 20,000 won.

185
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,350
Here you go.

186
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,540
- I got your card. 
 - Yes.

187
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,700
Arthropod shrimp belonging to the Decapoda Macroura family, hello!

188
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,620
Mackerel belongs to the Perciformes Scombridae family!

189
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,850
Spanish mackerel belonging to the Perciformes Scombridae family!

190
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,310
Where is rockfish in the Scorpaeniformes Scorpaenidae family?

191
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,520
Rockfish!

192
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,470
Rockfish! Where is rockfish?

193
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,400
There's no rockfish.

194
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,430
It has big eyes. Very big.

195
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,430
Ma'am, you left your umbrella! Umbrella!

196
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,660
Ma'am!

197
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,490
Ma'am!

198
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
She left this too.

199
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,600
Ma'am! Ma'am!

200
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,920
Ma'am!

201
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

202
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,800
It's crazy. It's crazy. Can't believe how beautiful she is!

203
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,000
Gosh, your complexion is so bright.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,020
Don't you think this hat will look great on you?

205
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,560
- Oh my! 
 - So pretty!

206
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,650
Try this on.

207
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,910
Oh my! It looks perfect on you.

208
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,420
Ten thousand won.

209
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,450
- Ten thousand won? 
 - Ten thousand won.

210
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,850
I don't have it.

211
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,600
But you're holding a card.

212
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,790
Card?

213
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,000
This isn't mine though.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,310
Don't worry.

215
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,900
Ta-da!

216
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,220
 A credit card for everyone! Enjoy it as much as you want!

217
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,950
This card is for everyone!

218
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,050
- Enjoy it as much as you want. 
 - Yes.

219
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,670
I'll swipe it.

220
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,410
- Swipe it. 
 - Swipe it!

221
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,540
Thank you.

222
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,980
Thank you.

223
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,600
- Thank you. 
 - Come again.

224
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,320
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

225
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,990
Su Gwang! Ma'am!

226
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,720
Thank you. I used it well.

227
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,070
A card for everyone.

228
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,460
I'll give you cash for things we couldn't get a refund for. I'm sorry.

229
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,380
You should control your girlfriend.

230
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,350
Otherwise, you'll be in big trouble.

231
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,890
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,900
Yes, my daughter.

233
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,510
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

234
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,330
That's so weird.

235
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,700
Give me some Spanish mackerel.

236
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,280
Yes. I'll just give you Spanish mackerel for free.

237
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,000
You told me to buy Spanish mackerel earlier, right?

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,510
Yes. Spanish mackerels. She's allergic to mackerels.

239
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,610
The guest coming over to my house is allergic to mackerel,

240
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,030
so she said to buy Spanish mackerels instead.

241
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,490
Here you are.

242
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,920
Okay. Thank you.

243
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,290
- I'll apologize again, ma'am. 
 - All right.

244
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,430
Ajumma! Ajumma...

245
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,620
Wait, wait, wait. That lady is a little strange, right?

246
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,740
She seems like she's a little slow. Yeah.

247
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,180
She does seem odd.

248
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,730
- She's odd. Odd. 
 - She's odd. She's odd.

249
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,900
- She's odd. Very odd. 
 - Bye!

250
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,620
She looks like she's from a rich family.

251
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,200
How did she hurt her head...

252
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,540
How do you know she's a rich girl?

253
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,560
I know a rich girl when I see one.

254
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,470
Hermes, Channel, Cartier.

255
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,820
I know because I used to sell imitation brands.

256
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,700
All those are authentic brands.

257
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,860
So what if she's wearing tens of millions of won?

258
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,210
She's a little slow.

259
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,510
That's what I'm talking about!

260
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,600
Did you see the gloves on her hands? I'm about to croak in this scorching heat.

261
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,080
I thought she put mayonnaise on her hands  (to moisturize her skin).

262
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,960
So, Oppa, even a rich family has some inside story.

263
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,810
But how did that unlucky Go Myeong Seong seduce a rich girl?

264
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,950
He's good-looking, so he must've seduced some dimwitted girl.

265
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,310
Whoa, that combination.

266
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,700
That combination is not ordinary.

267
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,980
Our market won't have to deal with worse luck because of them, will we?

268
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,400
- No way! 
 - Geez!

269
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,680
- No way! 
 - We have to get him out of here quickly.

270
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,730
- He must move out of his store. 
 - Right.

271
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,610
Why do you keep telling me about it?

272
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,410
He hasn't moved out of your rooftop house yet, either.

273
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,640
Because of that d*mn lease.

274
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,600
Su Gwang.

275
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,950
If you have amnesia,

276
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,970
you can't even remember that stealing is a bad thing?

277
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,980
Because it said it's a card for everyone and enjoy it as much as you want...

278
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,010
Get out.

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,990
Go straight to the left,

280
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,870
turn right at the end of the alley, and there's a police station.

281
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,810
Go there and ask them to find your mom.

282
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,970
Su Gwang.

283
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,620
Stop calling me by that name.

284
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,490
Go.

285
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,860
I don't ever want to see you again.

286
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,810
We have secured all 160 CCTVs and are checking them.

287
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,980
We've set up a search team, so we'll find her soon, Chairman.

288
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,140
Tell me.

289
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,410
Where did you send your daughter?

290
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,520
She would have gone where she wanted to go.

291
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,860
Tell me where your daughter went.

292
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,680
I have no idea.

293
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,640
Do you think your daughter can adapt to the world after leaving this place?

294
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,000
She's been locked up in this mansion for over 20 years, ever since she was born.

295
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,600
She's going to burn to death in the dirty air out there.

296
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,340
My daughter isn't as weak as you think.

297
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,020
Never.

298
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,540
I heard you took her outside once.

299
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,110
Are you out of your mind?

300
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,950
What's wrong with going outside for a bit?

301
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,240
How can a person live in captivity for more than 20 years when she's not even a prisoner?

302
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,990
Prisoners are humans.

303
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,380
They are not human.

304
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,000
They are just your talisman.

305
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,930
Don't talk about Seul Bi as if she's an object.

306
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,100
Don't pity her.

307
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,660
Don't feel any emotions for her.

308
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,810
They're witches who live by sucking on human misery and compassion.

309
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,220
They're different from human beings.

310
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,460
Stop it, Father.

311
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,710
Myeong Seong.

312
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,920
I heard some girl came to see you earlier.

313
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,060
What kind of relationship do you have? She's not your girlfriend, is she?

314
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,170
If you have the energy to talk bullsh*t, come and coat the chicken in batter, b*tch!

315
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,040
Mom, why do you call your daughter "b*tch"?

316
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,350
I told you not to talk to Myeong Seong!

317
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,130
How many times did I tell you? How many times?

318
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,770
- Mother! Mother! 
 - Because of you!

319
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,140
- Please calm down. 
 - "Mother"?

320
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,990
What in the world is going on here?

321
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,870
Even if she's your daughter,

322
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,320
you can be reported for domestic violence if you do that.

323
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,180
And if you want to be protected by a dispatched officer,

324
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,640
I can protect you immediately.

325
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,780
He's nuts.

326
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,960
How dare you hit on my daughter?

327
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,880
Mother, please refrain from violence.

328
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,290
Look at these guys.

329
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,730
If you hit on my daughter one more time,

330
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,930
I'll break your legs then!

331
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,410
I'll break them!

332
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,210
Hey, Officer Kim, you always asked me to eat at this market.

333
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,990
Did you do that to see that lady?

334
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,520
Huh?

335
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,440
Did you find her?

336
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,840
Not yet.

337
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,750
Min Joon, Jinsung Pharmaceutical filed

338
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,630
a patent infringement lawsuit against Geumhwa Biotech.

339
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,460
That's their claim.

340
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,410
What are the facts?

341
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,110
The facts are the same.

342
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,260
Tell the legal team to come in.

343
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,820
Sam Joong has been acting so cocky,

344
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,470
but look at him now!

345
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,870
Every newspaper is making a fuss about Geumhwa being sued,

346
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,190
and their stock prices falling!

347
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,130
That's what I'm saying. They must be busy with the lawsuit,

348
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,630
but I heard Geumhwa is looking for some girl.

349
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,950
They say she ran away from the hotel suite.

350
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,330
She must be Sam Joong's hidden daughter.

351
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,220
If she's born out of wedlock,

352
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,900
why would he have hidden her all this time?

353
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,510
It's been a while since Aunt passed away.

354
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,680
Do you want me to look into that?

355
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,250
I'm not interested in that family's business.

356
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,390
I know you're obviously very curious about it, Father.

357
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,720
Then don't ask me to tell you after I find out.

358
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,990
 Listen, Seul Bi.

359
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,870
 We are not human.

360
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,690
 We are different from humans.

361
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,060
 But a long time ago,

362
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,790
 a female shaman became a human.

363
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,560
 How?

364
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,990
 I don't know how, but

365
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,430
 she became an ordinary person

366
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,910
 and spent the rest of her life with the man she truly loved.

367
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,930
 I'll find that way, too.

368
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,630
 By all means.

369
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,310
 I'll get out of here.

370
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,570
 I will go to Su Gwang.

371
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,370
Earlier, that was...

372
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,650
Oh, my gosh!

373
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,040
She scared me!

374
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,710
Over there!

375
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,310
Isn't that the odd girl from earlier?

376
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,920
Oh my.

377
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,140
I guess she's been waiting for Go Myeong Seong all this time.

378
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,510
Myeong Seong should not leave this kind of girl alone outside.

379
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,120
Oh, gosh.

380
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,850
Miss!

381
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,300
Are you waiting for the fish shop guy?

382
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,890
Who are you?

383
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,190
I was there when you put on a hat and said, "Is this pretty?" earlier.

384
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,040
I said, "10,000 won."

385
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,980
I'm the fish shop building owner and

386
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,540
also the chairman of the Seodong Market Merchants Association.

387
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,530
Chairman?

388
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,210
Yes! That's right. That's right.

389
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,070
A high-ranking person?

390
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,400
That's right. He has a high position.

391
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,130
Hey!

392
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,070
Gong Su Gwang!

393
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,340
What are you doing here?

394
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,050
Take care of your girlfriend.

395
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,660
You should not leave her alone late at night!

396
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,780
- She's not my girlfriend! 
 - Oh, gosh!

397
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,960
Forget it then. Why are you so angry?

398
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,600
- Let's just go, Chairman. 
 - Yeah.

399
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,070
Kids like this always kiss and do everything else when we leave.

400
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,230
Aigoo!

401
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,170
Don't fight!

402
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,750
Let's go!

403
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,650
Gong Su Gwang.

404
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,260
Did you come because you were worried about me?

405
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,580
I'm not Gong Su Gwang. I'm Go Myeong Seong.

406
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,810
Did you change your name?

407
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,460
Why?

408
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,070
Why?

409
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,730
I like Gong Su Gwang though.

410
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,970
Oh, wait for me!

411
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,660
 Police Station

412
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,840
Hey, find your mom here.

413
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,650
Here?

414
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,530
If you go in there, there are police officers.

415
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,960
Police...

416
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,900
Oh, I know what it is. I saw it in a book.

417
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,710
Beeboo, beeboo! A police car.

418
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,410
That's good.

419
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,240
Police officers will find your mom for you.

420
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,270
What if they can't?

421
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,010
Do I have to sleep here?

422
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,940
If they can't find her...

423
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,440
Hey, hey! This punk!

424
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,140
Let go of me! Let go of me!

425
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,750
- Hey, Mr. Kim!
 - Hey, this punk!

426
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,910
I will make you...

427
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,220
Come here.

428
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,170
That f***er!

429
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,420
Let go of me, punk!

430
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,870
Hey, come here.

431
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,860
I...

432
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,600
should sleep with those ajussis?

433
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,790
Follow me.

434
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,000
 Lucky Fish Shop

435
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,800
I'll let you sleep at my house only tonight.

436
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,510
Go to the police station and find your mom tomorrow.

437
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,800
It's so pretty.

438
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,050
They are so sparkly.

439
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,380
I feel like I can reach them.

440
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,570
But I can't reach them.

441
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,030
It's pretty.

442
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,770
Hey.

443
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,310
What are you doing?

444
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,380
Wow! It's Su Gwang's house.

445
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,370
Sleep on the floor.

446
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,210
This is my house, and you're indebted to me. So don't complain.

447
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,560
I like it here. You're here, Su Gwang.

448
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,690
Stay away from me.

449
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,290
Wow!

450
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,690
I've never seen a book like this before.

451
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,840
Ta-da!

452
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,930
Hey!

453
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,730
What are you doing right now?

454
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,300
What?

455
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,020
Don't do stuff like that. Don't!

456
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,040
Hey. What are you going to do if I'm a bad person?

457
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,610
Su Gwang is a good person.

458
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,650
I love it here!

459
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,430
It's so comfy!

460
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,230
 Mom, why does the jewel shine?

461
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,380
 The female shamans of prophecy are born holding these blue jewels in their fists.

462
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,620
 Did I do that too?

463
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,020
 Of course.

464
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,270
 You were holding onto this with your small fist.

465
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,800
 Are all humans born with jewels in their hands?

466
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,280
 No.

467
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,180
 Humans aren't.

468
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,640
 We're different from humans, Seul Bi.

469
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,910
 But I look like a human though.

470
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,740
 We're like the Little Mermaid who came up to the land.

471
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,110
 The Little Mermaid?

472
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,690
 These jewels are directly connected to our lifeline.

473
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,670
 Every time we prophesy, the jewel sparkles.

474
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,600
 When our abilities are gone, and when our lifeline is waning,

475
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,720
 the light of the jewel is gone too.

476
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,730
 And eventually,

477
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,450
 the female shamans of prophecy will die.

478
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,110
Seul Bi.

479
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,860
Make it happen.

480
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,160
Mom, wait.

481
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,560
Mom.

482
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,780
Mom, wait.

483
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,350
Is the floor too cold for her?

484
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,590
They are all dead. Rockfish!

485
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,280
Scorpaeniformes...

486
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,610
Scorpaenidae...

487
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,940
"The Coast of Busan" likes them.

488
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,840
How come she sleeptalks like a marine ecology researcher?

489
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,730
Did she wake up?

490
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,320
I'm hungry.

491
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,640
I didn't eat anything yesterday.

492
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,150
I'm hungry!

493
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,070
Sh*t.

494
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,790
It's yummy.

495
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,320
It's yummy.

496
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,440
It's really yummy.

497
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,840
Do you remember anything from last night?

498
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,280
You talked a lot in your sleep.

499
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,960
Sleep talking?

500
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,390
What kind of dream did you have that you were so noisy?

501
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,030
I don't know. I don't remember.

502
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,130
You really don't remember your mom's number

503
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,400
or where she's staying? You really don't remember anything?

504
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,890
No.

505
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,130
But how did you remember me?

506
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,610
Because I like Su Gwang.

507
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,060
By chance did you check the Geumhwa Hotel?

508
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,240
You stayed at the Geumhwa Hotel before.

509
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,420
I don't remember.

510
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,250
This is called a whistle.

511
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,890
If something dangerous happens on the street, blow it real hard.

512
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,890
Then people will hear it and help you.

513
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,620
Geez, it's loud.

514
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,370
Now,

515
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,150
this is a self-defense spray.

516
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,610
If you run into bad guys, spray it on their faces and run away.

517
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,720
Hey, hey, hey!

518
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,170
Not me. Spray it on the bad guys.

519
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,160
Oh, I see.

520
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,590
Here. This is a map to the police station.

521
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,600
Police station?

522
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,180
If you go to the police station, they'll find your family.

523
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,080
Lastly and most importantly, here's some money.

524
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,550
If you want to eat something, pay with this.

525
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,970
If you want something,

526
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,200
you should give this money to the people and get what you want.

527
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,970
Never use other people's cards.

528
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,780
I will give you this.

529
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,550
Please let me live here.

530
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,510
You're so quick to apply the concept.

531
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,010
No.

532
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,320
- Why not? 
 - Never mind. Hurry up.

533
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,380
Bring your bag.

534
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,610
Geez. This is so harsh.

535
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,650
Hey. Look at that.

536
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,710
Do you see that? 
  Cannot have two people living in the rooftop room! Move out!

537
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,530
I'll get in trouble if you stay here.

538
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,270
I'll do my best not to put you in trouble, Su Gwang.

539
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,810
No. I think I'll be in bigger trouble if you do your best.

540
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,300
So please leave now.

541
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,530
Hope you can find your mom. Okay?

542
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,400
Fighting!

543
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,220
 Police

544
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,400
 Police

545
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,610
 Human Rights | Kindness

546
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,150
What brings you here?

547
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,910
I'm sure she'll take care of herself now.

548
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,430
She'll take care of it.

549
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,150
I've done enough.

550
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,890
Yes.

551
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,150
Oh, my gosh!

552
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,920
What's going on?

553
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,170
They were all fresh.

554
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,970
My rockfish are all dead. Seriously.

555
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,220
Rockfish?

556
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,950
Scorpaeniformes scorpaenidae?

557
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,810
 They are all dead. Rockfish!

558
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,270
What am I thinking right now?

559
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,280
Excuse me, sell all of the rockfish to me.

560
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,790
What? Give me a freaking break.

561
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,030
Th-That sounds g-good to us.

562
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,670
What are you talking about?

563
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,730
Why should Go Myeong Seong be our first customer of the day?

564
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,870
I'd rather throw them all away.

565
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,600
If you don't want to sell them, I'll just leave.

566
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,690
Young man, you're too hasty. How can you run a business like that?

567
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,550
I'll give you a discount. Take them all.

568
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,200
Please give me a big discount.

569
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,010
Pack them up. Give him a few more extras.

570
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,820
Come on.

571
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,970
Thank you!

572
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,940
Good luck.

573
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,110
Do you have rockfish? Rockfish?

574
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,020
- Where are rockfish?
 - Rockfish?

575
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,900
- Rockfish? 
 - We have rockfish and others...

576
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,800
Rockfish!

577
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,380
I have them.

578
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,100
We went all the way to the Haedong Fish Market.

579
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,060
- They ran out of it. 
 - Yeah!

580
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,010
Oh, really?

581
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,840
I bought all the rockfish from this place.

582
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,450
- Huh? 
 - Really?

583
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,970
Why did you do that?

584
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,560
A TV show featured fried rockfish a few days ago.

585
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,700
All the customers at the side dish store are looking for fried rockfish.

586
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,170
Oh, then you must need a lot.

587
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,770
Yeah! How much is it?

588
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,700
It's expensive.

589
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,690
Geez, that's okay! That's okay!

590
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,590
Here, here, here.

591
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,490
- We'll take them all. 
 - Yes, two boxes.

592
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,350
- Okay, okay. 
 - You can pay me later.

593
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,190
Okay, okay.

594
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,730
 The Busan Coast

595
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,490
The Busan Coast?

596
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,200
 "The Busan Coast" likes them.

597
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,570
No, it must be a coincidence.

598
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,180
I'm leaving.

599
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,440
No matter how hard you try, families whose luck is bad never work out.

600
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,790
Have you found her yet?

601
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,270
Not yet.

602
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,500
We'll try our best.

603
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,700
 Control Room

604
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,890
 Geumhwa Hotel &amp; Resort stocks plunge due to poor first-quarter business performance

605
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,450
We're going to change our patent infringement legal team

606
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,820
from A1 Law Firm to Lee Yul Law Firm.

607
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,820
We don't stand a good chance, but we'll make sure to win.

608
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,470
Please leave it to me, Father.

609
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,980
You should find her first.

610
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,040
Pardon?

611
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,100
No one else should touch her.

612
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,160
Just because Seul Bi is here doesn't mean we win the case.

613
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,710
You don't know what it means to...

614
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,520
see the future.

615
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,610
 The rooftop of a department store

616
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,010
 will collapse if you don't prevent it.

617
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,820
 - Why didn't you report this situation? 
 - My apologies, sir.

618
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,990
 Get the customers out right now and close the department store!

619
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,540
 Yes, sir.

620
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,530
 IMF, national bankruptcy.

621
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,240
 People are selling gold.

622
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,580
 We need dollars.

623
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,570
 Change all of our distributions to international exports.

624
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,110
 Make sure we obtain dollars at all costs.

625
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:24,900
 Convert all current funds into dollars too.

626
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,160
 1997 - Stock prices collapse 500 points

627
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,210
People wait for good fortune.

628
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:10,410
But if you have her in your hands,

629
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,430
you can create good fortune.

630
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,460
I'll handle the patent case on my own.

631
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,340
Go find her.

632
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,450
You trust me that little?

633
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,000
All right. I'll find Seul Bi.

634
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,900
But if I find her,

635
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,660
I'll treat her my way.

636
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,510
I hope she found her way back.

637
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,790
No. Why am I worried about her?

638
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,360
I'm sure she found her way back.

639
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,200
- What are you doing here? 
 - You startled me.

640
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,090
Hide and seek of love?

641
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,260
Don't talk to me.

642
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,880
I got in trouble with Su Gwang because of you.

643
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,240
Sweetie, where did you come from?

644
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,570
You look like a rich girl.

645
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,120
Just tell me what your story is, huh?

646
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,730
No. No.

647
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,160
Forget about her.

648
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,910
She's the bad luck jinx.

649
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,220
Forget about her, Gong Su Gwang!

650
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,810
 Fried Chicken

651
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,520
Yes, welcome.

652
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,020
Miss.

653
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,340
Do you want some twisted sugar doughnuts?

654
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,100
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

655
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,820
It's yummy.

656
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,760
Did you go home safely with Myeong Seong last night?

657
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,060
Keep it a secret from Su Gwang that I'm eating twisted sugar doughnuts here.

658
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,550
Who is Su Gwang?

659
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,820
Gong Su Gwang.

660
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,750
Gong Su Gwang from the Lucky Fish Shop.

661
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,050
Oh, Go Myeong Seong!

662
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,380
Not Go Myeong Seong. It's Gong Su Gwang. Gong Su Gwang!

663
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,850
Why are you getting angry?

664
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:09,860
Okay, I got it.

665
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,760
Either Su Gwang or Myeong Seong, I'll never tell him. Happy now?

666
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,580
Oh, it's time for our Tick-Tock to come.

667
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,300
Tick-Tock?

668
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,770
Is he your son, Ajussi?

669
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,190
A-Ajussi? Me?

670
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,160
Why is this lady making a bachelor a father already?

671
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,660
Let me tell you about Tick-Tock.

672
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,430
Let me see.

673
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,710
It's 3:59 right now, right?

674
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,790
57 seconds.

675
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,040
58 seconds.

676
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,370
59 seconds. Tick-Tock!

677
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,990
He's the son of that family. He's Yeong Wu.

678
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,940
From Monday to Friday, he appears at 4 o'clock every day. Never misses a day.

679
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,580
Even if it rains or snows, he's never late.

680
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,850
That's why he's called Tick-Tock.

681
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,310
I guess he's a punctual person.

682
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,750
But he's a little...

683
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,650
- Hello. 
 - Oh, yes, yes. Hi. You're here.

684
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,440
- Ahjussi, please give me a kkwabaegi (twisted donut). 
 - Okay.

685
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,710
Thank you.

686
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,310
This is as soft as seaweed in the ocean forest.

687
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,650
Oh, yes, yes.

688
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,350
Mangrove forests among sea forests are rapidly being destroyed.

689
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,620
The amount of carbon emitted due to the loss of mangroves is

690
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,690
one-fifth of the world's total carbon emissions from deforestation.

691
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:28,130
July 26th of every year is the International Mangrove Ecology Conservation Day.

692
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,110
You're right. Ding-dong-dang!

693
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,390
Destroying the algae in the sea forest is due to the raids of sea urchins.

694
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,440
To stop a swarm of sea urchins from gnawing at algaeâ€”

695
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,240
- We need to protect... 
 - We need to protect the sea otter that eats sea urchins.

696
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,080
You're correct. Ding-dong-dang!

697
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,010
Hey, Tick-Tock! I've never seen anyone on the same wavelength as you.

698
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:46,700
Right? Aigoo...

699
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,260
My family runs a side dish shop and a home-style baekban restaurant. 
  (Baekban: A "set" meal with side dishes, rice, and soup.)

700
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,280
Home-style baekban?

701
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,850
Baekban?

702
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,560
Do you eat that?

703
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,300
Ahjussi, this noona seems a little slow.

704
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,800
Yes, a little bit.

705
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,730
I'm not slow.

706
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm still adjusting right now.

707
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,480
Adjusting?

708
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,150
- To this world. 
 - To this world?

709
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,620
Does that mean you are from the other world?

710
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,520
- Yeah. 
 - It's amazing!

711
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,300
Come to my house if you want to eat this world's food.

712
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,300
Okay. Thank you!

713
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,460
Bye.

714
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,700
- Bye! 
 - Bye.

715
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,680
Please give me one more.

716
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,230
Okay.

717
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,180
Stop eating. You don't even pay for it.

718
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,810
Ajumma, this jeon  (Korean pancake)  is a little salty.

719
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,000
What kind of fish is this?

720
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,040
It's fried rockfish. Rockfish.

721
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,280
- Hyungnim. 
 - It's delicious.

722
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,000
I've collected all the interest.

723
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,720
- Only Go Myeong Seong didn't pay today. 
 - Again?

724
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,150
Because of him, my blood pressure's gone up,

725
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,390
and I even have hyperlipidemia.

726
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,280
His store needs to be doing well to make money.

727
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,870
He should've moved out of that store.

728
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,020
Yes, President Sin.

729
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,430
I'll get the money right away and call you back.

730
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,740
No, I will definitely send you the money today.

731
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,960
So please be sure to change the order.

732
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,810
Yes, please do it for me.

733
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,270
Yes.

734
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,140
That woman. She's the one.

735
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,700
What about her?

736
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,620
- I heard that she's Go Myeong Seong's girlfriend. 
 - Right.

737
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,040
The rumor is all over the market.

738
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,840
I guess there was an uproar here yesterday.

739
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,180
She clung to Go Myeong Seong and Go Myeong Seong kicked her out.

740
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,690
And then she spent a lot of money,

741
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,720
and Go Myeong Seong paid them all back.

742
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,980
They must really love each other.

743
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,820
- Bye. 
 - Okay.

744
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,180
Hello.

745
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:01,240
Did the woman who came here this morning go home safely?

746
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,830
You know...

747
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,240
Oh, that woman. She left.

748
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,170
She left? Did she find her family?

749
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:13,060
No. I asked if she needed any help, but she wouldn't answer me.

750
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,050
So I just let her go.

751
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,750
Why did you just let her go?

752
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,830
The entire market was in an uproar, saying she came looking for you.

753
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,490
Why are you getting mad at us after kicking her out?

754
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,370
We're the helping hand of the general public.

755
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:27,280
We're not the punching bag for the general public.

756
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,870
Where the heck did she go? She's not even right in the head.

757
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,750
Did she go back to the shop?

758
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,270
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

759
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,500
- Hello. 
 - Huh?

760
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,190
What's that? What's that?

761
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,990
What's with that strange picture?

762
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,500
Doesn't Mr. Wang really hate Myeong Seong?

763
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,240
So why is he taking the girl who came to see Myeong Seong?

764
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,000
Shouldn't we tell Myeong Seong about this? Huh?

765
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,600
 Seodong Market

766
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,040
 I remember her. I remember her!

767
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,060
 The taxi fare came out to be 150,000 won,

768
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,090
 but she left without paying.

769
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,100
 Oh, wait. She got off at the Seodong Market.

770
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,230
This perfect suit fit.

771
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,610
Oh, my. You're not from this neighborhood, are you?

772
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:36,700
Do you need some help?

773
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,040
By chance, have you seen this woman?

774
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,820
That's the girl who came looking for Myeong Seong earlier.

775
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,500
If you go around this corner, there's a shop called Lucky Fish Shop.

776
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,900
Check that store.

777
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,560
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

778
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,430
It's "Lucky."

779
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,660
My gosh... He's perfect.

780
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,710
 Lucky Fish Shop

781
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,030
Excuse me.

782
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,520
 Geoseong Private Loans | Dooil Trading Company

783
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,640
 We'll collect the money you couldn't get

784
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,920
"We'll collect the money you couldn't get."

785
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,860
Money.

786
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,710
Everyone is talking about money.

787
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,470
Oh my.

788
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,870
This. This!

789
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,970
Growl.

790
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,820
It's a tiger.

791
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,290
Whoa!

792
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,010
What is this?

793
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,180
She's quite unusual.

794
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,930
Tell me about it.

795
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,630
Drink this.

796
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,050
It's yummy. Yummy!

797
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,130
Is it her first time drinking this?

798
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:12,040
Her first time drinking coffee? Or mixed coffee?

799
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,110
Did Su Gwang say he's coming to pick me up from here?

800
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,940
Su Gwang?

801
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,800
Oh, Myeong Seong.

802
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,080
Yes, of course.

803
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,450
If you walk around alone, you might run into bad people.

804
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,660
He asked me to keep you here for a moment.

805
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,170
Thank you.

806
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,210
By the way, what's your name?

807
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,230
Seul Bi. Seul Bi.

808
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,050
Yes, Hyungnim.

809
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,480
Yes, I'll make a deposit right now.

810
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,980
Yes. Bye, Hyungnim.

811
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,180
Hey, hey.

812
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,850
I'll go make a deposit, so keep her safe.

813
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:56,850
Hyungnim, are we going to just keep her?

814
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,110
Of course, punk.

815
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,300
When Go Myeong Seong brings the money, we will let her go.

816
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,650
Do you think Go Myeong Seong will bring the money?

817
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:06,470
- She's pretty, so let's sell her and forgetâ€” 
 - Is this a**hole crazy?

818
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,620
You need some money too, Hyungnim.

819
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:12,440
And last time, Pig heongnim said he'd pay us well if we bring him a girl.

820
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,160
No matter how dirty I roll in this arena,

821
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,340
I don't sell people.

822
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,600
Shut up and just keep her safe.

823
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,890
Please give me another cup of this.

824
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,770
Oh, okay.

825
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,300
Hey. Give her another cup of coffee.

826
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,610
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

827
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,500
Miss, Myeong Seong will come to pick you up soon, so wait a little bit longer.

828
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,540
Yes!

829
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,230
My back.

830
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,900
Bye.

831
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,280
It's a waste to let her go.

832
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,040
Geez, she'd be perfect for handing over to him.

833
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,410
Yes, Mr. Wang.

834
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,530
Please wait a few days for the interest, and I'll have it for you.

835
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,750
It's already been three months since you put off for a few days.

836
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,310
Have you ever seen a loan shark waiting

837
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,100
so patiently with such a class?

838
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,990
Of course not. So please relax more while you're doing this with class.

839
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,150
 I have that woman.

840
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,830
"That woman"?

841
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,700
Was her name Seul Bi or Yi Seul?

842
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,190
You're dead if you lay a finger on her.

843
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,670
I guess you don't get what's going on?

844
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,630
Hey. Are you in a position to threaten me?

845
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,140
No, Mr. W-Wang...

846
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,110
I'll pay you part of the interest today.

847
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,330
Please let Seul Bi goâ€”

848
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,040
 Am I doing this to get some chump change from you?

849
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,290
Use your brain. Think where you can get money.

850
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,420
There are tons of private loan companies.

851
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,270
 Stop by a few places and get some money.

852
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,870
Otherwise, you'll never see that Seul Bi or Yi Seul.

853
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,680
Wait, Mr. Waâ€”

854
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,810
Sh*t!

855
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,890
Pig hyeongnim, please take her.

856
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,850
She's really awesome.

857
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,530
But she's a little slow.

858
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:08,010
If you give him a load of money, Mr. Wang will flip out and say yes.

859
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,750
Hurry up and come, Hyeongnim. Okay?

860
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,470
I have a question.

861
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,720
Isn't Myeong Seong a little strange?

862
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,090
When you're with him, aren't you jinxed or have bad luckâ€”

863
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,540
Things that were going well would turn bad. Didn't you notice that?

864
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,160
What do you mean get jinxed or have bad luck?

865
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,200
It's kind of like stepping on a piece of gum that I spit out while walking backward.

866
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,870
Oh, a piece of gum.

867
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,410
I've stepped on it before.

868
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,500
- Yeah! 
 - So sticky...

869
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,640
But did you feel that too?

870
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,170
Me?

871
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,300
No way! I stay far away from Myeong Seong to begin with!

872
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,700
I see. Even if you stay away from him, you don't look too good.

873
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,740
What? Me?

874
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,540
Gong Su Gwang?

875
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,710
Who parked a car on the crosswalk?

876
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,670
- Hey, ajussi.
 - Hey, Mr. Wang.

877
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,390
Long time no see.

878
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,590
Is this punk Pi Tae Sik f***ing out of his mind?

879
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,440
Let go of me! Let go of me!

880
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,340
Hey, sweetheart. Stay still.

881
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,990
You said Su Gwang was coming.

882
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,710
You liar!

883
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,920
If you stay with him, something bad will always happen.

884
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,520
This is that situation right now.

885
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,550
- Let go! 
 - Hey.

886
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,950
Oh, thank you!

887
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,310
Let's go. Let's go!

888
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,570
What are you doing?

889
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,320
Hyeongnim, look at this! We made some money!

890
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,130
I told you I'm not selling people.

891
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,810
Let's call off this deal.

892
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,590
Are you kidding me?

893
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,750
Are you crazy, Hyeongnim?

894
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,110
Do you really think Go Myeong Seong is going to bring the money?

895
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,110
Stay out of it, punk!

896
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:23,220
Hey, Mr. Wang and Pi Tae Sik.

897
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,280
I don't care whether you two fight or not.

898
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,810
If you played with Pig hyeongnim, you're both dead.

899
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,930
Those punks kill people for real.

900
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,190
Bring her out right now!

901
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,440
What? What's wrong with her?

902
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:53,440
Mr. Wang, that pushover.

903
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,330
How do I know the doctor?

904
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:01,640
Gosh, I feel sorry for his son, Hyeon Su, or whatever.

905
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,830
Oh, seagulls. Seagulls.

906
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,860
Seagulls are so loud!

907
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,090
How do you know my Hyeon Su?

908
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,460
Hurry up and bring her out!

909
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,220
Hurry up, and let's go!

910
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,800
Don't trust that man!

911
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,320
Hyeon Su needs me,

912
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,520
- not him! 
 - Go!

913
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,970
I can help Hyeon Su!

914
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:28,510
Hyeon Su needs surgery!

915
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:32,050
- Surgery! 
 - Let's go!

916
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:34,020
Right! Hyeon Su's surgery order!

917
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,300
Hyeong!

918
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,480
Hyeon Su's surgery.

919
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,560
You said you need to change the order of Hyeon Su's surgery.

920
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,720
Take care of that first.

921
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,700
Wait.

922
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,620
How does she know about Hyeon Su's surgery?

923
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,420
Sh*t. Sit down!

924
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,440
Come on, stay still!

925
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,890
Sit still!

926
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,810
Su Gwang!

927
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,830
Sh*t. What's wrong with this b*tch?

928
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,340
Give it back to me!

929
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,320
Seul Bi.

930
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,280
Hey, Eun Su! Eun Su! Stop! Stop!

931
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,060
Stop! Eun Su! Eun Su!

932
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,820
Let me borrow your bike for a second.

933
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,570
- No! 
 - I'm sorry!

934
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,080
What are you doing?

935
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,500
Sh*t. Thief!

936
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,030
You're right! Call the police!

937
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:35,700
 The person you are calling is not answering the phone.

938
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,450
Am I possessed by something?

939
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:44,710
 President Sin: I'm meeting with the surgery coordinator, so I can't talk. Hurry and make the deposit. I'll set up a surgery right away.

940
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,770
Gong Su Gwang!

941
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,100
Su Gwang!

942
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,280
Gong Su Gwang!

943
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,820
 What are they doing here?

944
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,710
- What's going on? 
 - Police!

945
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,640
- Police! 
 - Shut up! Make her shut up!

946
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,090
Turn to the side!

947
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,730
 Gosh! These f***ing seagulls are so loud!

948
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,410
 Honey.

949
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,670
 Come over here, honey.

950
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,910
 Mr. Wang, that pushover.

951
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,590
 How do I know the doctor?

952
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:46,510
 Gosh, I feel sorry for his son, Hyeon Su, or whatever.

953
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,400
 How do I know the doctor?

954
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,400
 Gosh, I feel sorry for his son, Hyeon Su, or whatever.

955
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,730
 What's that?

956
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,530
 You got a call from an unknown number.

957
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:58,410
I accidentally answered it.

958
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:00,070
Oh, sh*t.

959
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,420
- Helâ€” 
   - Where the hell are you right now?

960
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,250
How dare you mess with my son Hyeon Su?

961
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,480
You son of a b*tch!

962
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,000
Sh*t. Why did you answer my phone?

963
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,830
I didn't know!

964
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:19,330
 Hyeon Su needs surgery!

965
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,520
 Surgery!

966
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,680
Hyeong. Hyeong. Where are you going, Hyeong?

967
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,970
What? What the hell is that?

968
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,720
It's Su Gwang!

969
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,640
- Su Gwang! 
 - Sit still!

970
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,720
- Just run him over! 
 - Yes, sir!

971
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,300
Who the hell is he?

972
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,480
- Seul Bi! 
 - What took you so long!

973
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,640
Sorry!

974
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,170
Shoot!

975
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,230
What the?

976
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,240
What's that? Is it a palm blast?

977
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,800
No, a curse will be coming to you.

978
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,190
If you touch this hand, you are unlucky for three days.

979
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:29,550
Guys like you who kill people for a living could get killed, man!

980
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,950
Shoot!

981
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:36,990
Spray!

982
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,070
What a psycho.

983
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,990
Spray!

984
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,200
No, no!

985
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,110
What are you doing? Run away!

986
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,700
Hey! Odd girl!

987
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:11,970
Don't forget what you said!

988
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,590
Okay! I'll keep my promise!

989
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:16,810
What are you doing? Hurry up!

990
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,690
Hey! Stop!

991
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,540
- Su Gwang! 
 - What?

992
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,430
- This way! 
 - Oh, okay!

993
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,740
Hey, hurry up! Hurry up!

994
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,890
Hey! Stop!

995
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,070
Hurry up!

996
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,400
Hey, where are you going?

997
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,800
Why do you keep going into a corner and not the main street?

998
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,300
They're here! They're here!

999
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:21,770
It's a dead end.

1000
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:22,970
It's a dead end.

1001
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,040
Geez, what do we do! This is crazy!

1002
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,330
It's a dead end!

1003
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,420
What should we do? Hey!

1004
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,130
Geez, this is nuts!

1005
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:34,900
- Hi! 
 - You rats.

1006
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,460
It's all my fault.

1007
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,010
Please let her go.

1008
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,790
Su Gwang.

1009
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:59,970
Wait.

1010
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,140
Wait?

1011
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:11,340
â™«  Can't I love you?  â™«

1012
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:15,070
â™«  Can't we start our love?  â™«

1013
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:19,180
â™«  The only place for my weary heart to rest  â™«

1014
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:23,070
â™«  It's in your arms  â™«

1015
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:26,380
â™«  Can't I love you?  â™«

1016
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,510
â™«  Can't I embrace you?  â™«

1017
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:37,050
â™«  Even if I get hurt or in pain, I'll love you  â™«

1018
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,020
 Jinxed at First

1019
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,390
 Hey! Get him!

1020
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,430
 A rich girl who's about to marry the rich son of a chaebol family 
 (Chaebol: rich conglomerate family.)

1021
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:47,370
 has fled for love beyond the status difference.

1022
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,500
 Su Gwang.

1023
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,840
 That child is not supposed to be in the world.

1024
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,490
 Father.

1025
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:56,800
 Then there's no way to find Seul Bi's family?

1026
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,610
 Found it!

1027
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:01,180
 I wanted to fly far away,

1028
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,160
 but not now.

1029
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,740
 Because I came to be next to you, Su Gwang.
