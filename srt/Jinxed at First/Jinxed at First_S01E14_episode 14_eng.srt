00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,350
 Episode 14

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,030
Geez, you bastard.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,010
How old are you that you don't even have a driver's license?

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,880
Should I be the one escorting you around?

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,170
Geez. I'll get a license then, Hyeongnim.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,040
But, Hyeongnim, where is this place that they want us to go?

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,410
I don't know either, so let's just get there for now.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,630
Apparently, he'll be there.

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,180
It's not our boss's taste to stay at a place like that.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,830
He's more the type to be found drowning in alcohol at a club in the middle of Seoul.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,180
Hey, you a**hole.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,240
Su Gwang told us to go there!

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,130
Fine.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,830
How did Su Gwang know?

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,170
It's a place we couldn't even find.

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,560

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,750
What's the deal? We could just drink at the hotel.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,820
I got paid today.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,560
When we were in college, I always treated you guys when I got paid for my part-time gig.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,040
- Boss? 
 - Yes?

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,640
Please give us the most expensive dish here.

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,370
All right.

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,750
That's the Seon Min Joon I know.

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,740
I seem a bit crazy these days, huh?

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,730
I'm not ready yet, and I'm confused.

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,430
You'll do just fine.

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,770
That's why Chairman was able to trust you and leave things up to you.

28
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,140
He trusts me?

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,160
Father does?

30
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,550
He never approved of me. Not even once.

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,510
Being worried and not trusting are two different things.

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,390
It's not that Chairman didn't trust you.

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,560
He was just worried about you.

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,990
The last thing I did to Father was yell at him and get mad at him.

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,360
And then I ran away.

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
From now on, come here if you want to run away.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,700
I'll buy you the most expensive side dish for drinking.

38
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,140
All right. Thanks, Su Gwang.

39
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,790
Thank your younger sister.

40
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,450
Seul Bi is the one who pushed me to take care of you.

41
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,990
Do you know much Seul Bi takes care of you?

42
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm so embarrassed to face Seul Bi.

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,830
I couldn't even be a reliable support for her

44
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,130
and only showed her my ugly side...

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,880
even though I'm her oppa.

46
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,850
- Your dish is ready. 
 - Thank you.

47
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,990
Okay.

48
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,190
Eat up and become a reliable brother.

49
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,340
Say "ah." Go ahead, man.

50
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,400
There.

51
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,710
It's more delicious when I feed you, isn't it?

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,480
What is this?

53
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,970
What?

54
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,180
You don't remember?

55
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,300
That's what you're using to threaten Chairman Seon Il Jung.

56
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,990
What?

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,650
 Who is it?

58
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,420
 Gong Su Gwang.

59
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,500
 He got into Geumhwa Group with the highest score.

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,510
 You must take care of this properly.

61
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,770
 Young boss, the dumplings here are very good.

62
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,220
 Let's share everything together. Win-win.

63
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,640
 I don't care for that.

64
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,350
 I have no intentions of participating in illegal activities.

65
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,040
He's that guy!

66
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,740
But why is he still alive?

67
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,420
By chance, did you not kill him two years ago?

68
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,990
Why would I kill him?

69
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,200
- He's my son. 
 - Son?

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,880
But your son died a few years back.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,970
That's right. That son did die.

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,690
P-Please don't kill me.

73
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,510
If I let you live, you're going to harm my son again.

74
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,050
You should've just left it alone, as I said. What more is there to take away from them?

75
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,830
P-Please don't kill me.

76
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,820
I made a promise to my son

77
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,540
that I'll punish anyone who harasses my son.

78
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,970
- Whoa! Whoa! 
 - Hold on! Hold on!

79
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,170
Calm down. Calm down.

80
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,370
Ajussi, we're Su Gwang's friends.

81
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,370
Yes, we're here because Gong Su Gwang sent us.

82
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,450
We're on your side.

83
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,980
Su Gwang, we just got here.

84
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,900
 Ajussi, it's me.

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,350
Su Gwang.

86
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,640
Pack your belongings.

87
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,090
It's dangerous if you stay there.

88
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,840
Chairman Seon released all his people to look for you

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,130
so he can bury the incident from two years ago.

90
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,790
I've arranged a ship, so head over there immediately.

91
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,580
 Immediately.

92
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,610
Ajussi, calm down. Calm down.

93
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,610
 What will you do if you catch Geoseong Private Loans CEO Choi?

94
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,950
 You should report the incident from two years ago to the police.

95
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,760
 I've decided to let that incident go, Seul Bi.

96
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,620
 You don't need to do that for me, Su Gwang.

97
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,810
 I lost my mom because of that incident,

98
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,000
 but I don't want that incident to be revealed to the world

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,550
 and make you suffer.

100
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,400
 I just need to be able to save Mr. Go.

101
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,680
 Then leave that job to CEO Wang.

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,910
 I'll leave my oppa in your care.

103
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,160
Hey, Min Joon. Let's go now.

104
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,790
Let's go home. You've drunk enough.

105
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,260
Su Gwang, come here.

106
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,490
Let's drink this.

107
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,030
- Come here, man. 
 - That's enough.

108
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,670
Come on. Oh, gosh. You're so heavy.

109
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,520
There's still soju left.

110
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,440
Boss, please give us the check.

111
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,790
Put your jacket on.

112
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,360
Have a safe trip.

113
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,420
Take care of yourself.

114
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,410
Yes, Miss Seul Bi. You don't need to worry about the situation here now.

115
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,360
 If you catch CEO Choi, contact Seon Dong Sik.

116
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,830
Pardon? Who?

117
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,830
Hand CEO Choi over to Seon Dong Sik.

118
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,090
And please keep it a secret from Su Gwang.

119
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,640
All right.

120
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,780
What's wrong, Hyeongnim?

121
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,500
Thank you for saving me.

122
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,350
I'll generously forgive you for taking my position.

123
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,920
It's for old time's sake.

124
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,400
Yes, right.

125
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,740
Here.

126
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,350
 Even if we give him money to shut him up now,

127
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,330
 he'll continue to blackmail me, saying he'll spill it all.

128
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,370
 If you find that bastard CEO Choi, just kill him.

129
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,240
 The incident from two years ago will also be buried with that son of a b*tch.

130
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,040
 Yes, Chairman. Please leave it to me.

131
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,140
You get the gist of what's going on, right?

132
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,610
Seon Il Jung, that son of a b*tch!

133
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,040
So are you going to kill me, too?

134
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,650
Then why would I have saved you earlier?

135
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,770
You remember this, right?

136
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,440
It turns out that you gathered quite the collection of Eunsung Capital's data, Boss.

137
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,450
There is some data on Seon Il Jung's corruption

138
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,950
as well as data on Seon Dong Sik's corruption.

139
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,610
In my opinion,

140
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,560
you should threaten Seon Dong Sik instead of Seon Il Jung.

141
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,360
I think you'll be able to get some money out of him then.

142
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,330
Thanks.

143
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,070
Do you have some money?

144
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,340
Do you have your wallet?

145
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I don't, Hyeongnim.

146
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,360
Who the hell are they?

147
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,420
Geez, where the hell am I?

148
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,340
Managing Director Seon?

149
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,690
It seems like my father has no intentions of giving you money.

150
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,130
It's about time I ended my financial relationship with Chairman.

151
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,130
Then why do you think you were taken and brought here?

152
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,620
What do you mean, taken and brought here?

153
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,120
I missed you, Director Seon, so I let them catch me.

154
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,910
You know the years we spent together are not short.

155
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,440
There was the M&amp;A deal

156
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,140
as well as the manipulation of stocks.

157
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,770
As long as people don't touch my food bowl,

158
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,110
I never bite my owner.

159
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,840
Meow!

160
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,170
That's not the correct answer.

161
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,250
Hey! What's the correct answer?

162
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,770
Bite your owner.

163
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,780
Regarding the instigated murder from two years ago,

164
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,230
spill it all to the police.

165
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,780
That instigated murder.

166
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,340
You do know that it was your father, Chairman Seon Il Jung, right?

167
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,890
Are you not his biological son?

168
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,720
If you turn yourself in and get released after a couple of years,

169
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,070
I'll make sure to give you a pretty food bowl.

170
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,350
You're thinking, "This guy's a crazy bastard," aren't you?

171
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,660
You're right.

172
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,330
I am a crazy bastard.

173
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,650
So if you refuse that now,

174
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,510
you can imagine what'll happen, right?

175
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,810
Turn yourself in and tell them what my father has done.

176
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,430
Truthfully and without leaving anything out.

177
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,280
You're going to tell them everything.

178
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,240
Okay?

179
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,920
Gosh, let go.

180
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,350
Let me go!

181
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,080
I came here on my own two feet!

182
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll tell them everything once I get inside.

183
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,460
Gosh, you people.

184
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,620
Wow, as expected of Miss Seul Bi.

185
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,380
How far ahead can Seul Bi look into the future?

186
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,030
It means she knew that Seon Dong Sik would attack his own father. Wow.

187
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,340
- Then what happens now? 
 - Huh?

188
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,720
Aigoo, that feels good.

189
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,730
Yes, yes, yes.

190
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,610
The weather is so nice.

191
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,300
You menace!

192
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,000
It's cold! Close that window!

193
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,570
Aigoo, aigoo.

194
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,030
Seon Il Jung, you're under arrest for instigating murder.

195
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,450
What is this?

196
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,360
Instigating murder? Father, did you by chance—

197
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,270
You have the right to remain silent, and you have the right to an attorney.

198
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,100
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

199
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,130
Hey! What are you people doing right now?

200
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,100
I'm a patient who's been admitted to this hospital!

201
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,690
- Chairman. 
 - Take him.

202
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,920
- Hey! 
 - Take him.

203
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,890
- Dong Sik! 
 - Father.

204
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,550
- Wait, hold on. 
 - Father!

205
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,570
Dong Sik, call Attorney Kim,

206
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,300
and contact your uncle! Dong Sik!

207
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,100
- Father! 
 - This can't be happening!

208
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,010
- Dong Sik! 
 - Father!

209
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,940
Dong Sik!

210
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,790
Chairman!

211
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,340
Father. Father. Father.

212
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,540
I'll take good care of Eunsung from now on,

213
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,640
so instead of becoming a burden to your son,

214
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,750
you can spend the rest of your life comfortably in prison.

215
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,870
I never knew

216
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,440
I'd be able to hold your hand as much as I'd like.

217
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,020
Seul Bi.

218
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,230
How is the chairman?

219
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,550
Is something wrong?

220
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,180
Mom, can the future that I saw

221
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,140
be wrong?

222
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,020
What did you see?

223
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,870
Can I change the future I saw?

224
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,060
I can probably change it, right?

225
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,240
Chairman did that and saved Min Joon.

226
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,590
Seul Bi.

227
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,920
Mom.

228
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,840
If we start making attempts to avoid some futures,

229
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,110
they will also start squirming in order to bring us in.

230
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,300
So no matter what choices we make and what consequences we pay,

231
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,200
if we end up reaching that future after some time,

232
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,800
then that was something inevitable.

233
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,100
A fate we cannot change.

234
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,810
A fate that we cannot change.

235
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,250
Seul Bi.

236
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,220
You must not make dangerous decisions.

237
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,410
 No.

238
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,250
 No! Su Gwang!

239
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,970
 Su Gwang! No!

240
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,420
Did Ajussi leave?

241
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,290
Thanks to you, I was able to protect Mr. Go.

242
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,480
Thank you.

243
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,050
What a relief.

244
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,970
But why did you do that?

245
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,500
I'm talking about CEO Choi.

246
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,730
Why did you hand him over to Seon Dong Sik?

247
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,340
The police asked me about the incident two years ago.

248
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,120
Why did Chairman Seon Il Jung try to kill me

249
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,070
and was there's a grudge between us.

250
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,890
I told them I didn't know anything for now,

251
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,460
but once the police start investigating, you and this place will be revealed.

252
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,730
Do you still think that I can't stand proudly in front of the world?

253
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,620
It's not like that, Seul Bi. I'm just worried about you.

254
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,000
Even if you have nothing to be ashamed of,

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,770
people will still look at you with unkind eyes.

256
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,470
It really worries me that you'll get hurt

257
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,760
by those sharp stares.

258
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,180
Everything will be revealed in the end, Su Gwang.

259
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,690
No matter how hard you try to hide everything for my sake,

260
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,510
the whole world will end up finding out about it.

261
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,170
I'll become naked in front of the whole world

262
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,690
and become miserable.

263
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,390
And...

264
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,970
you'll leave me.

265
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,270
That's the future I saw.

266
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,340
Lies.

267
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,350
We're going to break up anyway.

268
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,200
So just leave me, Su Gwang.

269
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,790
If I leave,

270
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,300
can you be happy?

271
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,170
If I leave,

272
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,510
can you be free?

273
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,200
I don't know what future you saw,

274
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,380
but our future will not be unhappy.

275
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,350
Do you know why?

276
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,530
It's because you made me into a man of good fortune.

277
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,620
So no matter what misfortune approaches us,

278
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,940
I'll change it into good fortune.

279
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,110
♫  I’m reminded of you whom  ♫

280
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,580
Don't go anywhere.

281
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:22,200
♫  I buried deep in my heart  ♫

282
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:30,640
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

283
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,000
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

284
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

285
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:52,100
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

286
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:59,600
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

287
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:12,580
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

288
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,180
And then,

289
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,520
I said I'm just going to leave.

290
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,120
- Welcome. 
 - Oh my, oh my!

291
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,810
Aigoo. Drink with everyone here, not by yourself at home.

292
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,530
Mrs. Bang, three pints (500cc), please.

293
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,190
Three pints coming right up!

294
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,390
How come I see you more often here than at the police station?

295
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,140
Aigoo, it's a good thing!

296
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,020
It's also good for Seodong Market security.

297
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,900
I told her to take the civil servant exam, but she brought a civil servant boyfriend home instead.

298
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,850
Gosh, whatever!

299
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,780
Help yourself to some more chicken.

300
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,290
Ajussi, my dad caused my mom a lot of heartache with his drinking.

301
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,050
So you should drink in moderation.

302
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,010
They're already a family.

303
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,710
Mrs. Bang might have a thorny personality, but she's a good person.

304
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,720
That's who I am.

305
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,700
She's not even shy about it.

306
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,810
What's there to be shy about? Even my mom got remarried two years ago.

307
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,110
If your hearts are in sync, it's an absolute go.

308
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,750
You're crazy.

309
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,310
I've never been married.

310
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,220
- What? 
 - Oh my!

311
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,210
So he's younger and a never-been-married bachelor?

312
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,560
Oh my! Oh my! He's totally brand new!

313
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,940
Eonni, you got such a deal!

314
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,290
Then I guess I should be their officiary.

315
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,890
Should I buy a new suit?

316
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,830
What kind of situation is this?

317
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,690
Who said I'm getting remarried?

318
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,530
Oh my gosh.

319
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,310
What is this?

320
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,360
A chaebol chairman has been arrested on instigated murder charges.

321
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,890
- Huh? 
 - Why are you reading the news?

322
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,990
Wait, I mean...

323
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,240
- Eunsung Capital's Chairman Seon Il Jung. 
 - Huh?

324
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,850
Instigated murder in the first-degree specific to a domestic crime punishable by law—

325
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,650
- Gosh. 
 - Anyway, chaebols are so...

326
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,640
So what if you're a chaebol...

327
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,680
Aigoo, it's okay.

328
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,090
 Ajussi, Chairman Seon Il Jung has been dealt with.

329
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,940
 Ajussi, from now on,

330
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,100
 you just have to live happily with your new family.

331
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,410
Three pints.

332
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,690
Hyeon Tae.

333
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,780
Hyeon Tae.

334
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,460
Let's have a drink together.

335
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't read the news. Why would you want to see the atrocities of the world?

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,060
That's right.

337
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,010
They say that humans will be extinct in the year 2100.

338
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,120
Once again, you're going too far.

339
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,100
It's so nice.

340
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,390
Oppa, come over to our house when you're free.

341
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,540
Mom said she wants to treat her future son-in-law.

342
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,880
But you'll probably need to starve for at least two meals.

343
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,110
It's a dish you can eat only if you're absolutely voracious.

344
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,040
Jang Gyeong, should we rush our wedding?

345
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,100
Yeah, let's do that.

346
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,670
My mom also wants us to rush the wedding.

347
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,230
I'll be busy with work,

348
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,930
so I'm sorry I won't be able to prepare for the wedding with you.

349
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,990
You can prepare it any way you want with your mother.

350
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,920
Don't worry, Oppa.

351
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,720
Okay.

352
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,950
Have you been doing well with Jang Geun?

353
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,310
Oppa?

354
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,360
Gosh, he's more like a villain than an oppa.

355
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,010
He always gets drunk and tells me he wants to quit being a doctor

356
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,270
and asks why I'm the only one who gets to do what I want.

357
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,770
Geez, he always gets drunk and calls me to complain.

358
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,340
But from time to time,

359
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,840
when I see him say, "my little sister, my little sister,"

360
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,670
and he takes care of me,

361
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,760
I wonder if this is what family is.

362
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,600
My little sister.

363
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,630
My little sister.

364
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,120
Let's go.

365
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,350
Uncle has been arrested.

366
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Su Gwang's incident from two years ago

367
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,210
wasn't your doing, Father.

368
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,080
Why did you do that?

369
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,440
I'm your son, yet you didn't say a word to me.

370
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,840
Don't worry.

371
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,070
I'll do my best.

372
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,430
Ms. Mi Su and my little sister.

373
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,720
I'll take good care of them.

374
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,450
So don't worry too much.

375
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,670
And please,

376
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,910
please come back, Father.

377
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,880
These are all the cards that Seul Bi wrote to her dad since she was a kid.

378
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,780
"Dad, what do you look like?"

379
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,580
"Do you look like me?"

380
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,940
"Dad, I thought Santa

381
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,940
would bring you to me,

382
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,030
but he didn't."

383
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,230
"Where are you right now, Dad?"

384
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,400
"Please come quickly

385
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,890
and take Mom and me out of here."

386
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,900
It's our Seul Bi's birthday today.

387
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,670
I'm fine, Mom.

388
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,690
 No! This is what I wanted from Dad.

389
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,390
 Not the chairman, but from Dad!

390
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,190
 It's my birthday,

391
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,650
 but why isn't Dad coming?

392
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,930
 I'm sorry, my daughter, Seul Bi.

393
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,760
 The things I did to you

394
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,230
 can probably never be forgiven.

395
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,370
 But Seul Bi,

396
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,870
 I'm really happy that you're my daughter.

397
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,110
 Use this when you need it.

398
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,770
 I'm sorry, my daughter, Seul Bi.

399
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,820
What brings you here?

400
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,640
These are documents Chairman left for you.

401
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,430
A distribution affiliate, LS Company's president's term has ended, so

402
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,390
he said you could take that position.

403
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,630
He also prepared a letter of appointment.

404
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,250
The position will be officially issued to you next Wednesday.

405
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,180
After Min Joon stably completes his management succession first,

406
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,520
I'll think about it after that.

407
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,340
 Let's go shopping.

408
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,530
 You'll go with me, right?

409
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,770
Hyeon Tae, are you okay?

410
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,400
- I'm okay. 
 - Have a seat. Have a seat.

411
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,590
How do you feel? Do you have a cold?

412
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,320
Oh my, oh my. You have a raging fever.

413
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,520
- Oh no. 
 - It's okay.

414
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,870
- Ajussi. 
 - Su Gwang!

415
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,510
Seul Bi, you're here, too.

416
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,020
You guys are unaffected by Seon Il Jung's arrest, right?

417
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,100
You're okay, right?

418
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,210
We're fine. Don't worry.

419
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,970
You innocent kids are suffering because of us sinful adults.

420
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,520
What's wrong? Are you sick?

421
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,790
He has a fever. Go and buy some medicine.

422
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,200
Okay, I'll be back.

423
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,180
- I'll be right back. 
 - I'm fine!

424
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,090
Look at this fever.

425
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,000
What are we going to do? My gosh.

426
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,460
Seul Bi, nothing is going on between us.

427
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,420
We're nothing.

428
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,860
What should we do?

429
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,820
- Here you go. 
 - Okay.

430
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,260
- Thank you. 
 - Take care.

431
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,350
Make sure you eat well, too.

432
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,480
Three meals a day with the medicine.

433
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,800
Don't make us worry.

434
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,460
I'm very thankful for you two.

435
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,310
I thought my life was a failure,

436
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,160
but now I have a family too, just like Seul Bi said.

437
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,490
Oh, you're here. Hyeon Tae!

438
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,130
You took your medicine.

439
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,310
Have some hot yuzu tea.

440
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,710
Oh yeah, Seul Bi, everyone's going to gather at my chicken restaurant tonight.

441
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,230
You should come too, okay?

442
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,200
Tonight?

443
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,820
Yeah. What's there to think about?

444
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,820
Just come, okay?

445
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,590
- Come with her! 
 - Okay.

446
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,540
I'm going.

447
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,470
- Thank you for the tea. 
 - No problem.

448
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,350
How's this?

449
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,680
That design is more suitable for a trot singer dinner show.

450
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,530
Then...

451
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,760
This one. How's this?

452
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,540
That's pretty,

453
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,520
but it's more like a style when Mr. Park goes on a blind date.

454
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,590
It's a bit boring.

455
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,870
Seul Bi, do you know I've been standing like this for 20 minutes?

456
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,250
No, it's been 12 minutes.

457
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,100
Mr. Hong, please choose one for me.

458
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,990
But for people who only wear designer brands,

459
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,270
I'm not sure if our shop's neckties will be suitable.

460
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,370
How's this one?

461
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,610
How's this, Su Gwang?

462
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,340
Isn't that too fiery-looking?

463
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,420
The color gets you excited, right?

464
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,450
Usually, gifts should be a style that stands out.

465
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,520
Ones you don't usually buy.

466
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,250
I can't do this any longer. I can't do this!

467
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,140
Just give us everything.

468
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,440
Seul Bi, let's just buy everything.

469
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,140
Then you buy all of these.

470
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,750
Okay, sure.

471
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,800
And please use this card to pay for these clothes.

472
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,890
It's my lucky day today.

473
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,680
- Su Gwang and Seul Bi, you're here! 
 - Hi, Mr. Park.

474
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,250
Mr. Park! Su Gwang,

475
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,680
Mr. Park has been making me do all sorts of jobs since you left.

476
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,600
Do you know how exhausted I am? Shame on you!

477
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,890
Aigoo, someone would think you do all the work in Seodong Market Merchant Association.

478
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,930
Our market decided to start an online delivery service.

479
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,210
He's making such a big deal about finding a delivery company.

480
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,500
Making a big deal?

481
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,680
I did everything!

482
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,500
Mr. Park, don't bother Mr. Hong so much.

483
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,720
Anyway, Seul Bi, come to the chicken place tonight and eat some chicken together.

484
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,170
We called everyone over, so you must come, okay?

485
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,080
That's right. You absolutely must come tonight.

486
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,040
- Tonight? 
 - Yeah!

487
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,030
Yes, this is Gong Su Gwang from the secretary's office.

488
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,710
In the proposal that the planning office submitted last time,

489
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,640
wasn't there something that supported Internet delivery services for traditional markets?

490
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,450
Yes. There's a market that suits that proposal.

491
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,160
Yes, I'll discuss it in more detail once I get back.

492
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,310
- Thank you. 
 - Oh my gosh!

493
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,010
You're so cool. You're so cool! Daebak.

494
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,880
"Yes, this is Gong Su Gwang from the secretary's office."

495
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,360
- Wow. 
 - As expected, Su Gwang is a man of good fortune.

496
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,430
Although your body might be far away, good fortune stays near!

497
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,170
Wow! What a nice quote!

498
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:46,480
Is all this possible because Miss Seul Bi bestowed us with good fortune?

499
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,410
That's right. That's right!

500
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,900
Gosh, seriously.

501
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,370
I'm back!

502
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,580
You bought a lot of stuff.

503
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,310
Mom, ta-da! Look at this.

504
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,470
What is that?

505
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,260
This is a gift that Su Gwang bought for you.

506
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,940
It's so pretty, Mom.

507
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,770
- Thanks. 
 - It suits you.

508
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:19,390
And this is a gift for Chairman.

509
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,800
Look at this.

510
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,510
Seul Bi bought you a gift.

511
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,730
Don't you think it'd look good on you?

512
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,950
This is your gift, Oppa.

513
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,430
- Me too? 
 - Yeah.

514
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:42,690
I wanted to buy a gift for everyone in our family.

515
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,490
Family.

516
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,990
Ah...

517
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,990
Look at this.

518
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,810
This cardigan,

519
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,410
this hat,

520
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,630
and this bag

521
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,360
were all bought with the card Chairman gave me.

522
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,660
So these are all

523
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,350
gifts that Dad bought us.

524
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,960
So we're a family now, right?

525
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,730
Just as Father took my place,

526
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,410
I'll also take your place.

527
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,920
From now on, Ms. Mi Su and Seul Bi,

528
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,180
I'll take responsibility and protect them.

529
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,600
Don't worry.

530
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,410
And Su Gwang,

531
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,040
please take good care of my little sister.

532
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,830
Don't worry.

533
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,630
My gosh! I'm so hungry.

534
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,140
Let's hurry and eat. Secretary Cha, please sit.

535
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,090
- Let's eat together. 
- Let's sit and eat.

536
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,890
- Have a seat. 
- Thank you.

537
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,160
Looks good.

538
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,460
 Eunsung Capital

539
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,730
What's happening?

540
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:33,560
Wow, CEO Choi must have honestly confessed everything exactly the way things happened.

541
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,860
Goodbye, Eunsung Capital.

542
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,110
But will it affect Geoseong Private Loans?

543
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,680
Boss has cleared up all the dirt for us,

544
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,810
so we just need to get a fresh start.

545
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,920
Shall I make a report to Miss Seul Bi?

546
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,310
Yes, Miss Seul Bi.

547
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,720
As you said, an arrest warrant has been issued for Seon Dong Sik.

548
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,870
 Will this be enough?

549
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,500
 If Seon Dong Sik is caught,

550
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,960
 will Su Gwang be safe?

551
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,140
No.

552
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,950
It won't be like that.

553
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,650
I'll be able to change it.

554
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,630
We would've been in big trouble if we hadn't been contacted ahead of time.

555
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,180
F**k!

556
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,960
So what if they call us to make a run for it?

557
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,790
What the hell are they doing that an arrest warrant was issued for me?

558
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,760
The fund fraud and embezzlement are all Father's work.

559
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,590
Chief Kim was able to stop it at the police station,

560
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,170
but the Prosecutors' Office issued the arrest warrant.

561
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:56,100
CEO Choi had some data with him when he turned himself in,

562
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,770
and all your illegal activities were included in it.

563
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,670
They froze my bank accounts, too?

564
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,490
My heart's pounding.

565
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,960
If I hadn't withdrawn everything beforehand, we'd have been robbed!

566
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,460
Did you store all the cash we withdrew safely?

567
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,510
Yes. I'll arrange a temporary place for you to stay for now.

568
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,860
Isn't something off?

569
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,640
The fact that CEO Choi was fired was because of Seul Bi.

570
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,050
Father was ousted after working with Eun Ok Jin. That was also because of Seul Bi.

571
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:48,100
CEO Wang became CEO of Geseong Private Loans also because of Seul Bi.

572
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,930
CEO Wang

573
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,230
is close with the merchants of Seodong Market, right?

574
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,900
Where Seul Bi was.

575
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,940
Yes.

576
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,310
CEO Wang is the one who turned over CEO Choi to us

577
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,210
to make him turn himself in to the police.

578
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,150
Now that I think about it,

579
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,440
everything seems to be connected to that female shaman.

580
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,740
It's that b*tch.

581
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,680
The one who f*cked me over.

582
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,020
I'm not going down nicely.

583
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,710
What will you do?

584
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,400
Manager Yeom.

585
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,060
Yes.

586
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,810
We'll have to discharge a certain someone from the hospital.

587
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,810
I'm going to kill her.

588
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,160
 Emergency Call

589
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,960
 Ballot Box

590
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,370
Mrs. Bang.

591
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,430
Mr. Hong.

592
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,730
Where is everyone?

593
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,960
Surprise!

594
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,590
Seul Bi!

595
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,000
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

596
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,390
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

597
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,180
♪ Happy birthday dear Seul Bi ♪

598
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,530
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

599
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,660
Happy birthday!

600
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,170
Happy birthday!

601
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,100
Yay, yay!

602
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,940
Unfortunately,

603
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,080
due to a chronic illness, Chairman Seon Sam Joong

604
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,970
will no longer be able to manage the business.

605
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,260
Thus, Seoul Family Court

606
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,170
determined Chairman Seon Sam Joong a grantor of a power of attorney

607
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,020
and appointed Director Seon Min Joon as the agent of the  power of attorney.

608
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,800
Therefore, the emergency board meeting will proceed to

609
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,490
vote for Director Seon Min Joon as the chairman of the board of directors.

610
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:21,220
Unfortunately, my father's long-standing illness has worsened

611
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,690
and although I lack experience,

612
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,720
I have been granted a power of attorney.

613
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,310
With the assistance of many directors,

614
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,980
I will work hard to develop Geumhwa Group

615
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,900
into a more advanced company than now.

616
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,580
 Geumhwa Group Shareholders Meeting

617
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,790
Now, we'll commence the anonymous voting.

618
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,330
 Ballot Box

619
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,210
 Geumhwa Group Shareholders Meeting

620
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,820
Nice!

621
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,180
- Nice, nice, nice, nice. 
 - This is good.

622
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,190
Wait, Gong Su Gwang is the one who told us to get together,

623
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,780
but he's the one who's not here.

624
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,130
I know.

625
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,270
I mean, it's Seul Bi's birthday, so he shouldn't be like that!

626
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,170
If he leaves her so lonely like this,

627
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,140
I'll run after him right away and scold him big time.

628
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,100
He's Geumhwa Group's Secretary Gong.

629
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,270
- He's busy. 
 - But still!

630
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,700
- But Seul Bi, help us relieve some of our curiosity. 
 - Sure.

631
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,370
So Seul Bi,

632
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,130
whose daughter are you from Geumhwa Group?

633
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,410
Chairman Seon Sam Joong?

634
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,670
- Are you curious? 
 - Yeah.

635
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,920
Then I'll invite you to our house soon.

636
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,560
- Huh? 
 - To your house?

637
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,100
- To your house? 
 - Us?

638
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,020
All of us?

639
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,850
Sounds great!

640
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,780
It's going to be fun.

641
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,530
 Geumhwa Group Board of Directors Meeting

642
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,570
- What is this? 
 - What are they saying?

643
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,110
For 20 years, Chairman...

644
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,400
Is that something a human would do?

645
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,370
To do that to his own child?

646
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,560
How could he have done that?

647
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,390
Director.

648
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,740
"A female shaman has been locked up in Geumhwa Hotel for 20 years!"

649
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,170
I mean, what's going on? 
  A secret space hidden by Chairman Seon Sam Joong

650
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,790
How could someone do that?

651
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,180
How is this possible?

652
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,830
Is this true, Director?

653
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,720
This isn't something a human can do.

654
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,270
How can this be possible?

655
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,740
Due to exceptional circumstances, we'll postpone today's board meeting until next time.

656
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,330
What in the world?

657
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,960
Say something! You can't just leave like that!

658
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,670
Hey! Hey!

659
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,780
There are reporters gathered in the hotel lobby.

660
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,610
Seul Bi's safety is our priority for now.

661
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,720
Call Su Gwang to confiirm their location,

662
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,160
and send bodyguards to the lobby to secure their entry route.

663
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,290
And...

664
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,630
the shareholders must not be swayed.

665
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,980
Please warn the press that we'll take legal action if they spread false information.

666
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,510
All right.

667
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,680
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, did you see this?

668
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,710
Apparently, Seul Bi noona is a female shaman whom the Geumhwa Group imprisoned for 20 years!

669
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,040
- Huh? 
 - What?

670
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,700
What nonsense are you spewing?

671
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,190
- Just eat. 
 - What is he saying?

672
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,530
- What is it? 
 - It's true.

673
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,990
- What is? 
 - For real?

674
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,950
What?

675
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,890
- What is it? 
 - What's wrong?

676
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,790
It's probably a mistake.

677
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,880
Gosh, come on.

678
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,620
What I meant was...

679
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,810
Seul Bi!

680
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,410
Oh, he's here.

681
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,410
- Su Gwang. 
 - Su Gwang Hyeong.

682
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,160
- Su Gwang. 
 - Su Gwang.

683
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,000
Let's go. We need to go back.

684
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,970
Hurry up and go back, Seul Bi.

685
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,020
Hurry!

686
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,800
- Hey. 
 - Seul Bi.

687
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,140
- Seul Bi. 
 - Seul Bi.

688
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,650
Su Gwang.

689
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,250
Seul Bi.

690
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,280
They raised her like an animal for 20 years!

691
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,170
Seul Bi is really a female shaman?

692
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,690
- Wait, so she's not Geumhwa Group's daughter? 
 - She's not a chaebol's daughter?

693
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,370
What situation is this?

694
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,230
- Wait, Hyeon Tae— 
 - What's going on?

695
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,790
It's that woman!

696
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,160
It's that woman!

697
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,450
That woman is the female shaman

698
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,980
who lived in the hotel's secret space for the past 20 years.

699
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,070
For being unable to keep that woman's secret,

700
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,920
I was admitted to a psychiatric ward for the past two years against my will.

701
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,750
Geumhwa Group's Seon Sam Joong

702
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,360
is a shameless criminal!

703
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,060
Were you really imprisoned for 20 years?

704
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,980
Is it true that you can see the future?

705
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,480
Please take off your gloves.

706
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,880
- Are you really a female shaman? 
 - Tell them!

707
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,530
That you're a female shaman who Seon Sam Joong raised.

708
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,080
Go on and tell them that you're a fortune-telling tool for Geumhwa Group!

709
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,000
Please tell us!

710
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,510
Please say a word!

711
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,410
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,100
I'm sorry, Ms. Min.

713
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,070
I'm sorry! Please move aside!

714
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,900
What will you do now, female shaman?

715
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,400
Mom.

716
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,100
Ms. Min came looking for me.

717
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,560
I must meet Ms. Min.

718
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,650
Now isn't the time, Seul Bi.

719
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,900
She probably suffered greatly because of me.

720
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,350
Who is Ms. Min?

721
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,860
She's a nurse who

722
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,710
took care of me and Seul Bi for 20 years.

723
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,020
Two years ago, we heard that she was sent

724
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,360
somewhere for being unable to protect Seul Bi.

725
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,750
What are we going to do about legal affairs?

726
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,520
We'll be investigated for the inducement for profit, fraud using minors,

727
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,850
imprisonment, violation of the Labor Standard Act, etc.

728
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:33,350
I've ordered our legal team to come up with a response.

729
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,180
Then we'll meet with Ms. Min and formally apologize to her

730
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,160
and compensate her.

731
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,030
If this issue becomes public,

732
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,680
Ms. Mi Su and Miss Seul Bi will also suffer.

733
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,710
From the start,

734
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,510
there was no need for my existence to be kept a secret.

735
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,410
Isn't that right, Oppa?

736
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,380
Until everything blows over,

737
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,470
I think it's a good idea for Ms. Mi Su and Miss Seul Bi to stay at the villa with Chairman.

738
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,380
I'm not hiding anywhere.

739
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,530
There's no reason for me not to be able to stand proudly

740
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,210
in front of people.

741
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,600
Let's face them head-on.

742
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,180
Min Joon.

743
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,460
This is something that's been hidden for decades.

744
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,990
There's a reason a secret should stay a secret.

745
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,210
Geumhwa Group will waver.

746
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,650
What Seul Bi said is correct.

747
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,400
We can't hide and avoid it forever.

748
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,460
As Father's son,

749
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,850
I'll take responsibility as our family's representative.

750
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,820
Let's face them head-on.

751
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:53,090
It's our Seul Bi's birthday, but she left without even eating cake.

752
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,800
So why did you all turn pale, like you dipped your face in frying mix,

753
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,770
and stare at Seul Bi like that?

754
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,050
Whose fault is this, huh?

755
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,700
Eun Su, you punk. This is all because you blabbered about the news.

756
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,240
If you hadn't done that, we would be partying right now!

757
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,220
Go on and eat!

758
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:12,300
No wonder. What Seul Bi said and how she acted were a bit strange.

759
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,710
She was imprisoned for 20 years.

760
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,350
You think strange is the end of it?

761
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,700
How could those Geumhwa Group bastards—

762
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,370
How could those bastards confine someone for 20 years?

763
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,590
I can't just sit still.

764
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,490
- I'll f*cking destroy these sons of b*tches. 
 - Eonni, Eonni!

765
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,690
Sit down, sit down. Why are you getting all riled up?

766
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,250
Geez.

767
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,330
So did Mr. Jeong know about this or not?

768
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,580
Where's Mr. Jeong?

769
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:40,030
What would Hyeon Tae know?

770
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,270
Right?

771
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,090
You a**, finish stuffing your face and go to the library!

772
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,660
- And stop using the internet! 
 - Geez!

773
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,630
Seul Bi.

774
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,840
 It was that scene.

775
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,730
 The future I saw.

776
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,730
 It's that woman!

777
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,990
 This is the beginning.

778
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,770
What is that?

779
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,930
I was going to join the party at the market,

780
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,670
but things turned out like this,

781
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,720
so I couldn't buy a cake.

782
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,330
Happy birthday, Seul Bi.

783
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,890
Thank you.

784
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:44,150
♫  Please notice me  ♫

785
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,100
Today's the day I was revealed to the world.

786
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,900
Seul Bi, were today's events part of the future you saw?

787
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,730
♫  Please notice my feelings for you  ♫

788
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,940
I wish tomorrow wouldn't come.

789

♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please be with me  ♫

790
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,070
I'm not afraid of tomorrow.

791
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,650
Do you know when the happiest moment in my life was?

792
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,070
When?

793
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,690
Right now.

794
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,730
I'm the happiest right now with you by my side,

795
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:24,150
and I'm really happy that we'll be together tomorrow as well.

796
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:32,470
♫  For your love, we will never be again  ♫

797
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,470
I told you, right?

798
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:39,470
No matter what misfortune approaches, I'll turn it into good fortune.

799
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,710
So don't worry.

800
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,390
When this time passes,

801
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,280
the brightly brilliant day will come to you for sure.

802

♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

803
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,680
♫  I knew it was you  ♫

804
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,750
♫  Can I smile now?  ♫

805
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:07,800
♫  Please notice my feelings  ♫

806
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,630
Min Joon.

807
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,040
Your decision

808
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,970
hasn't changed, right?

809
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,920
Just like how Father protected me in his own way,

810
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,400
I'm also going to protect my family in my own way.

811
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,850
You're cool, Seon Min Joon.

812
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,930
The rumor that was reported a few days ago

813
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:38,860
about the mother and daughter who lived in a secret space within Geumhwa Hotel for the past 20 years

814
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,880
is true.

815
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,770
- It's true? 
 - Are you serious?

816
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:45,470
Are you admitting that they've been illegally imprisoned for 20 years?

817
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,970
Due to my father's mistaken judgment,

818
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,890
I admit that he constrained

819
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,520
the mother and daughter's activities for their safety.

820
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,840
According to informants,

821
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,510
it's said that you imprisoned them and made them tell your fortunes.

822
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,600
We sometimes asked them for business advice and received their help.

823
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,230
Then I guess the saying that Geumhwa Group's growth to this point

824
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:05,260
is all thanks to shamans is true?

825
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,110
Geumhwa Group's development is a result of the group efforts of executives and employees,

826
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,760
including my father.

827
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,450
Were you also aware that the mother and daughter were imprisoned?

828
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,150
I heard they were imprisoned and raised like animals.

829
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,950
Did you not realize that was a grave crime?

830
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,780
The provocative content that has been reported to the media

831
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,080
that they've been raised like animals is not true.

832
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,100
How will you take legal responsibility?

833
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,770
Father is currently

834
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,540
facing mental limitations

835
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,630
and carries the status of a grantor of a power of attorney.

836
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,610
The legal responsibility falls to me as the power of attorney agent.

837
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,530
I sincerely apologize for causing inconvenience

838
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:46,530
to the people regarding an unpleasant matter.

839
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,250
Look over there!

840
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,980
Over there!

841
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,860
Seul Bi, there's no need for you to go this far.

842
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,890
Ms. Mi Su.

843
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,210
It's fine, Su Gwang.

844
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:14,210
 Emergency Press Conference, Investigation into Geumhwa Group's Alleged Illegal Confinement of Mother and Daughter

845
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,010
I'm the person who's been living within the secret space of Geumhwa Hotel for 20 years.

846
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,770
What kind of abuse have you endured all this time?

847
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,570
Do you have any health problems due to being confined for 20 years?

848
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,260
We were not being confined.

849
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,500
If you weren't confined, does that mean you willingly chose to live there?

850
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,330
I secluded myself there for personal reasons.

851
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,500
I was not confined.

852
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,660
This is solely my responsibility,

853
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,270
and neither Chairman Seon Sam Joong nor Geumhwa Group holds any responsibility.

854
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,820
As for Director Seon Min Joon especially,

855
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,490
after discovering that we were being secluded,

856
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,890
he tried his best to take my daughter and me to the outside world.

857
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,480
Please stop your criticism of him.

858
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,670
I heard the two of you told fortunes, so are you shamans?

859
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Please answer! Are you shamans?

860
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,600
Telling fortunes is not a legal problem whatsoever.

861
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,250
Please avoid asking personal questions.

862
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:23,370
Then were you Chairman Seon Sam Joong's mistress?

863
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,060
Please avoid any questions regarding private matters.

864
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:32,320
This person is like a mother to me.

865
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:38,490
And she is my younger sister.

866
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:46,560
Then Seon Min Joon and that woman are half-siblings?

867
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,480
That's right.

868
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:55,100
Are you sure that she wasn't confined and forced to play wife?

869
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,450
I was not.

870
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,420
It was my decision to seclude myself in the secret space.

871
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,310
Then what made you raise your daughter in confinement as well?

872
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,340
I am freely participating in outdoor activities.

873
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:11,630
You didn't attend school, and you're not even registered in the family registry.

874
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:14,430
So is there some way you can prove that you weren't confined?

875
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,350
Please answer.

876
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,820
Please answer!

877
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,270
Please tell us!

878
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,540
Let us know!

879
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,850
Seul Bi!

880
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,710
Seul Bi!

881
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:43,690
Seul Bi!

882
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,270
Seul Bi!

883
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,580
 Geumhwa

884
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:53,370
Everyone, Seul Bi works at our market!

885
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,250
Which market is it?

886
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,540
Tell us the name of the market!

887
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,550
Okay! Okay! Stop!

888
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,290
It's Seodong Market located in Seodong-gu,

889
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:04,630
and Seul Bi is the best salesperson in the market!

890
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,210
That's right! Our chicken restaurant also became a hit.

891
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,530
Our chicken is really delicious.

892
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,440
Do any of you reporters want a taste?

893
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,630
Mom, you should hold it so they can see our store name.

894
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,100
Bang's Chicken!

895
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,870
Their restaurant is next to our store.

896
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:21,640
You don't know how kind Seul Bi was to our son.

897
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,230
She's very friendly and is very good at running the business!

898
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,690
Seul Bi Noona is perfect!

899
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,610
She's perfect!

900
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,090
Over here, Seul Bi is perfect.

901
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,390
Now, look at this!

902
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,690
Ta-da!

903
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,620
She has the face! She has the body!

904
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,400
She almost became a model for my apparel store!

905
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,710
She's celebrity class!

906
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,690
I'll make an urgent announcement, too.

907
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,570
I have a husband named Jeong Tae.

908
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,430
But he's full of hot air inside his heart.

909
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,800
So he almost became a conman,

910
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,930
but our Seul Bi prevented any of that from happening!

911
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,170
This is for real!

912
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:57,220
And the fact that our market almost got conned by a remodeling contractor

913
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,550
was also prevented by Seul Bi!

914
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,030
And, and, and!

915
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,210
She helped me get a girlfriend!

916
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,930
A cupid of love! No...

917
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:07,000
She brought sunshine into my life.

918
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,490
She's one of those people...

919
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,740
No, no!

920
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,600
She prevented a murder from occurring!

921
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,220
What's wrong?

922
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,300
Hyeong, Seon Dong Sik was here just now.

923
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,920
How could that bastard come here?

924
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,400
Isn't he prohibited from departing the country and on the wanted list right now?

925
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,220
I found out that the one who brought the person to expose everything to the media

926
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,850
and mobilized the reporters was also Seon Dong Sik.

927
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,810
Seriously, these people.

928
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,370
Were they enemies with Miss Seul Bi in their past lives?

929
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:36,490
It's concerning because it seems like they're hovering around her.

930
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,800
Hyeong, please look into some places Seon Dong Sik might go to.

931
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,730
Yeah. I'll release my people and look for him.

932
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,570
Count on me.

933
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,420
"Third generation chaebol that sells fish?"

934
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,880
"Thrifty and beautiful chaebol of the common people."

935
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,430
Geez. What a joke.

936
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,710
There seems to be a checkpoint ahead.

937
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,400
What?

938
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:11,030
I'll do a brief check.

939
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,710
Pass.

940
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,450
Chief Kim seems to be looking out for us.

941
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,840
He did receive a nice bribe from us.

942
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,670
I secured the cash I got from selling Geumhwa Group shares.

943
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,450
What is this now?

944
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:43,630
What's wrong?

945
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,920
I made a false report?

946
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,450
These people are taking me down blow after blow.

947
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,660
Who is this ajumma?

948
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,930
She's the nurse who succeeded Ms. Min and took care of the female shamans.

949
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,140
I made her do some interviews with the media.

950
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,340
Please give us the money as you promised.

951
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,200
Money?

952
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,830
These ajummas don't understand the situation.

953
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:35,290
You said you'll give us money if we do as you say.

954
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:39,300
You ajummas also confined those female shamans in Geumhwa Hotel.

955
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,990
You're also Chairman Seon Sam Joong's accomplices.

956
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,380
How about it?

957
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,990
Should I put prison food on the lunch menu tomorrow?

958
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:50,260
And the interviews are already nowhere to be seen.

959
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,210
And the press is calling the "chaebol daughter thrifty and beautiful."

960
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:57,260
They're only posting sh*tty articles.

961
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,570
Can't you give a proper interview?

962
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,730
Please stop, Director.

963
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:07,090
It won't be any help to us to make things worse than they already are.

964
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,380
I told you to stop nagging me.

965
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,430
I told you to stop nagging me!

966
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,920
I was already sick and tired of my father's nagging!

967
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,540
Anyone who goes against me will all—

968
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,940
You will all die, okay?

969
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,990
I'm going to kill you.

 Third Generation Chaebol's Common Part-Time Job

971
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,960
The media's reaction is actually good.

972
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,000
Seul Bi's image is bright and respectful,

973
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,810
so talk of confinement and being raised is no longer being brought up.

974
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,510
I didn't know that the Seodong Market people would go all out to help us.

975
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:51,620
You called them, right?

976
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,440
They all really like Seul Bi.

977
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,290
Were you able to contact Ms. Min, by any chance?

978
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,620
Her contact number and location are all meticulously hidden.

979
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:10,210
Ms. Min was confined because of me, but I couldn't do anything.

980
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,190
It's not your fault, Seul Bi.

981
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:16,880
I'll contact her by any means and make sure to compensate her.

982
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,430
Ms. Min is probably with Seon Dong Sik right now, right?

983
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:25,240
The police are looking for Seon Dong Sik right now, so he'll be caught in no time.

984
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,800
 No!

985
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,160
 No, Su Gwang!

986
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:53,890

♫  On a day not so far away  ♫

988
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:06,070
♫  On the day you were by my side  ♫

989
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:12,210
♫  Green leaves grow on the sunny street  ♫

990
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:17,910
♫  Everything in this world was happy  ♫

991
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,410
♫  On a day not so far away  ♫

992
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,200
 Jinxed at First

993
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,720
 I'm going to disband Geumhwa Group.

994
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,700
 I think that's the way we can end this curse that the men in our family have borne from generation to generation.

995
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,110
 The one that's going around on the internet? I saw that, too.

996
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,430
 Is she really a witch?

997
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,580
 Hey, don't say that.

998
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,000
 There's still some power left in me.

999
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,560
 So I want to use the last of my power for us.

1000
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,830
 Oppa. Mom!

1001
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,280
 Didn't you miss me?

1002
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,790
 - What do you want? 
 - You'll...

1003
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,680
 come to me on your own.

1004
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:55,050
♫  I don't know when  ♫
