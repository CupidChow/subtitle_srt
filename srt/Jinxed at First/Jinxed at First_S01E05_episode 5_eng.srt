1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,200
 Episode 5

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,520

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,090
Oh my.

4
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,070
He's here. He's here. He's here again!

5
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,290
Something-Bri-Vuittong is here again. 
  (She's botching the brand-name clothes he's wearing.)

6
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,500
Why is he all heart and soul over Seul Bi

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,510
- who's got a few loose screws? 
 - Exactly!

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,310
If you wear rose-colored glasses,

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,130
even goat sh*t can look like black pearls.

10
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,260
But did Myeong Seong go somewhere?

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,820
You don't know?

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,210
He and Seul Bi went on a vacation to Busan together.

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,890
- Vacation? 
 - Vacation?

14
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,850
Oh my, I'm envious.

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,500
They went on a vacation?

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,110
When? Only the two of them? Seul Bi and Myeong Seong?

17
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,360
Either fry chicken when you're at the store or

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,330
go home and study for your exam, b*tch!

19
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,510
For how many days and nights? When will they be back?

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,550
Are we some sort of travel agency?

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,430
Go fry some chicken.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,860
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,450
Oh, so perfect.

24
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,760
Look at that perfect view from the back.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,530
- Oh, honestly! 
 - Oh my.

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,070
Sh*t.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,780
Hey, Min Joon! Here.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,570
What are you doing, man? Come here.

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,960
Man, we used to come here often because of Su Gwang, right?

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,860
It's been so long.

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,230
Yeah.

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,930
Shouldn't we hurry and go meet Su Gwang?

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,510
Where does he live now, huh?

34
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,800
I don't know either. I just happened to bump into him.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,440
What about his number?

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,630
You must've taken his number, right?

37
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,330
Hey! You should've taken his number down!

38
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,400
Why didn't he contact us until now? Huh?

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,890
Why in the world?

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,030
Sh*t.

41
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,470
The balls aren't hitting home... sh*t.

42
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,810
F**k.

43
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,780
You bastards.

44
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,160
The boss's words don't mean anything to you?

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,290
The VIP is looking for her.

46
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,690
You should present the woman to him immediately.

47
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,440
What are you doing?

48
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,330
Really, what are you doing?

49
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,870
Aren't you going?

50
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,450
Aren't you going?

51
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,880
- Get out!
 - Yes, sir!

52
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,580
Hey, Pi Tae Sik.

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,280
You son of a b**ch!

54
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,390
You crawled out already when I clearly told you to lay low?

55
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,890
I heard the rumors.

56
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,300
Don't you think the woman that the VIP is searching for

57
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,350
might be that woman at Go Myeong Seong's?

58
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,700
Show me her photo.

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,840
Hey, you...

60
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
Never tell anyone about that.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,090
If you do, you're dead meat!

62
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,420
Why?

63
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,090
The guys are spread out all over our neighborhood anyway.

64
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,580
It's better business for us to be the first to give the boss a heads up

65
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,860
so that we can at least get a nice bonus.

66
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,530
No.

67
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,210
Never happening.

68
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,660
Hyeongnim, you're very weird these days.

69
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,700
Hey. Lie low for a while.

70
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,660
Boss, I saw the woman that you're searching for.

71
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,920
What?

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,600
The place I saw her was...

73
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,270
This is delicious.

74
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,630
- Would you like one more? 
 - After I finish this.

75
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,340
Go Myeong Seong!

76
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,020
- Did Myeong Seong go somewhere? 
 - Myeong Seong

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,590
went on a trip with that woman.

78
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,070
To where?

79
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,360
- Busan. 
 - Busan?

80
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,010
Mr. Wang said he saw that woman.

81
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,440
At Busan Station.

82
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,630
I'll need you to send out some of your men from the Seagull Gang.

83
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,920
They went to Busan?

84
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,010
Why would they go there?

85
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,560
Why are you yelling at me?

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,040
Did I send them there?

87
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,660
The two of them went because they wanted to.

88
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,610
Sh*t, I lied that they were in Busan.

89
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,970
Why would they go to Busan?

90
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,380
Su Gwang, do you want a kiss, too?

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,820
 Mr. Wang

92
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,510
- Yes? 
   - Hey, Go Myeong Seong.

93
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,470
Why don't you pick up your phone? Where are you right now?

94
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,070
Why? I'm driving.

95
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,100
- Hey. Don't go to Busan. 
 - What?

96
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,620
I said you can't go to Busan.

97
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,860
Why not?

98
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,510
Well, a VIP is looking for a woman

99
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,090
and the boss showed us her photo.

100
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,450
 But she looks so similar to Miss Seul Bi.

101
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,290
What are you talking about out of the blue?

102
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,270
Who's the VIP and who's the boss?

103
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,690
The boss is our boss

104
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,870
and I don't know who the VIP is either.

105
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,470
 Anyway, they were searching our neighborhood,

106
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,070
 so I lied to them, saying she was in Busan, you sh*t!

107
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,750
So don't go to Busan.

108
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,680
I can't understand anything you're saying.

109
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,120
I need to look at the navigation, so I'm going to hang up!

110
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,160
 Busan

111
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,330
 Sunghwa Hospital

112
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,220
 I guess your nightmares are getting worse these days.

113
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,430
 I'm talking about that one.

114
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,620
 It's a talisman to prevent nightmares.

115
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,400
 Our father once tried to get that thing.

116
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,500
 He doesn't need it anymore though.

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,850
 Mi Su.

118
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,050
 Mi Su! Put down the gun. Put down the gun, Mi Su!

119
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,640
 No.

120
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,630
 That man must die.

121
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,380
 I'm going to kill him with my own hands!

122
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,130
 No!

123
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,170
Compared to the last time you visited,

124
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,220
there hasn't been much improvement.

125
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,160
Everyday conversation is impossible

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,830
and he abhors any light,

127
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,100
so we're keeping all the lights off.

128
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,030
You're here.

129
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,320
You're here.

130
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,810
Come and join us.

131
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:12,880
You will also become like us.

132
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,930
Us.

133
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,300
That child has run away.

134
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,390
Just like 20 years ago.

135
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,830
It's going to come to us.

136
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,880
Why did you do that back then?

137
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,960
It's going to you.

138
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,210
It's Busan. Busan!

139
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,120
Whoa, it's the ocean!

140
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,090
It's a real ocean.

141
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,900
Do you think it'll be salty if you taste it?

142
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,120
It's probably salty, right?

143
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,270
Do you think there's a millstone in the ocean

144
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,160
going around and around, grinding out the salt?

145
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,100
- Millstone? 
 - Yeah.

146
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,340
Oh, the one from the folktale?

147
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,890
Yeah!

148
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,830
♫  I'll look at you a little more  ♫

149
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:47,170
♫  Please notice my heart  ♫

150
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,150
♫  Feel the feeling of walking on the clouds with me  ♫

151
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,180
This isn't the place.

152
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,380
You said it was Yeong Wu's grandma's restaurant.

153
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:03,450
♫  If you hold my hand, I can go higher  ♫

154
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,800
Here. Never let this leave your body

155
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,620
and treat it as an extension of your body.

156
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,890
Extension of my body?

157
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,900
Yeah.

158
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,380
I've installed the lost child prevention app

159
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,420
so I'll be able to tell where you are at all times.

160
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,250
You'll know where I am and when?

161
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,950
You'll be able to find me even in the Milky Way?

162
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,490
Why would you go to the Milky Way?

163
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,340
You always wander off so carelessly,

164
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,900
so I'm going to leave this on you.

165
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,940
Like a cat's bell.

166
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,430
I think it'd be so cool to wear a cat's bell and go to the Milky Way.

167
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,730
Right, Jjong?

168
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,160
All right, you're curious about many things, so...

169
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,150
Here.

170
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,780
Press this like this and ask whatever you're curious about.

171
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,790
Gong Su Gwang!

172
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,410
No, not me. Ask something else.

173
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,830
What do I do to make Su Gwang like me?

174
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,770
You think it'll answer a question like that?

175
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,010
- Ask something else— 
   - Pay attention to your outfits.

176
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,440
 Modest outfits are nice, but sometimes sexy outfits—

177
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
Whoa, whoa! Wow!

178
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,150
The world has become so advanced. It even tells you these things.

179
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,990
Right?

180
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,600
Thank you.

181
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
What were you talking about earlier?

182
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,920
A VIP is looking for Seul Bi?

183
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,100
Our gang is looking for Miss Seul Bi.

184
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,580
The gangs in Busan should be on the move too, so be careful.

185
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,060
Do you think the VIP might be Seul Bi's family?

186
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,210
If they are family, of course, they should meet.

187
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,570
They would've searched for her through the police if they were family.

188
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,560
Do you think they would order back street gangs to look for her?

189
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,890
All right. I understand.

190
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,800
Let's talk once I get back to Seoul.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,210
What the f**k are you saying?

192
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,880
Those sons of b**ches!

193
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,830
Do they need to have their noses stuffed in rotten fish

194
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,510
and suffocate for them to come to their senses?

195
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,100
Whatever. I'm going to change companies.

196
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,390
Hang up!

197
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,120
Wow, the boss is fierce.

198
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
- She does a number. 
 - Really.

199
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,960
Good at cursing means she's good at cooking.

200
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,840
- Eat your fill. 
 - It tastes good.

201
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,310
Hyeongnim, it's a girl.

202
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,720
You're right. 
  Boss

203
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,890
She's pretty.

204
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,300
Yes, Hyeongnim.

205
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,520
Yes, we're eating.

206
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,910
Yes, understood.

207
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,550
Yes, sir.

208
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,160
Hey, Grandma?

209
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,930
Have you ever seen this woman?

210
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,760
Hey, you a**hole.

211
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,270
It's been years since I've even seen my children.

212
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,820
Why are you looking for your girl here?

213
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,720
Right?

214
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,380
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,570
Thank you for the meal.

216
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,940
Wow, it's so big.

217
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,870
Hey, look here.

218
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,740
Yes?

219
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,520
I'm looking for a person.

220
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,390
Move it.

221
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,960
What's wrong with all the women in this neighborhood?

222
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Let's go.

223
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,350
Is something wrong with the neighborhood's drinking water?

224
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,550
- Let's go. 
 - Sure.

225
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,440
How many times did I tell you to switch the company from Seoul?

226
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,630
Those rotten a**holes just gobble the money

227
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,680
and they don't do the work they're supposed to when I tell them what to do!

228
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,550
Hang up!

229
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,360
How could you bring a freaking dog into a restaurant?

230
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,030
I've seen this girl somewhere.

231
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,650
Aren't you Yeong Wu's grandma?

232
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,440
Those sly foxes.

233
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,120
I sent them a dog

234
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,630
so that they would bring it back in person.

235
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,630
They still didn't come.

236
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,570
Jjong wanted to come back home.

237
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,900
Get it out of my face, or go throw it away.

238
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,110
You raise it yourselves. It's not my business!

239
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,300
Get out!

240
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,560
You're disrupting my business. Get out.

241
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,650
What's wrong with you? Why don't you leave?

242
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,470
I'm hungry.

243
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,360
What?

244
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm hungry.

245
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,500
We raced here for five hours, and you won't even feed us.

246
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,750
I'm so hungry, Grandma.

247
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,730
Something smells delicious, right?

248
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,090
- Yeah, food. 
 - Please give us some food.

249
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,190
It's delicious!

250
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,020
Wow, this is the most delicious food in the world, Grandma.

251
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,420
Grandma, you're the best.

252
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeong Wu once said that his grandma's food tastes the best in the world.

253
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,300
Gosh, no way.

254
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,970
Well...

255
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,680
here.

256
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,350
 JJong 
 My grandmother's cooking is the most delicious in the world. I want to eat it again.

257
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,440
My mother ran a fish store,

258
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,850
so she also frequently made me fish dishes.

259
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,200
I can't eat them now.

260
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,750
Why can't you?

261
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,340
She passed away

262
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,360
two years ago.

263
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,830
Then do you run the store?

264
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,590
Yes.

265
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,550
I stayed at the school dormitory before she passed away,

266
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,990
so I couldn't see her often.

267
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,710
I still regret that even now.

268
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,340
I should've just stayed with her.

269
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,930
I should've just lived with Mom.

270
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,850
After Yeong Wu was born,

271
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,430
we all lived here together and

272
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,810
we ran the restaurant together and raised the child together, too.

273
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,060
But watching Yeong Wu grow up,

274
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,970
I realized that he was a bit off, you know.

275
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,600
I'm an old person, so I don't even know what you call it.

276
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,050
I just said one thing,

277
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,220
but she got furious

278
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,480
and left for Seoul, demanding we should cut ties.

279
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,520
What did you say?

280
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,560
That he's a retard.

281
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,760
But then, she wouldn't contact me for years

282
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,750
and treated me like a sinner.

283
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,610
Aigoo, do you think that

284
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,100
I would have been happy that my grandson was like that?

285
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,880
Then you just need to say one thing.

286
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,060
Say what?

287
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,480
That you're sorry.

288
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,390
Must I

289
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,220
say that out loud for them to know?

290
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,170
Why wouldn't you say it out loud?

291
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,660
What are you saying?

292
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,140
You're good at saying other things.

293
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,720
I see that you're good at cursing

294
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,710
and good at saying things that hurt other people,

295
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,930
but why can't you say that you're sorry?

296
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,500
Saying sorry is

297
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,290
the same as saying "thank you" and "you've done well."

298
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,520
What a rude punk.

299
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,810
Grandma.

300
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,020
If you just say you're sorry,

301
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,100
you can cook the most delicious food in the world for Yeong Wu.

302
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,160
Yeong Wu has been waiting all this time.

303
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,580
Is it such a big deal to say that?

304
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,120
You're still wet behind the ears, and you dare to teach an elder?

305
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,410
Anyway, eat some more fish.

306
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,320
Grandma,

307
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,500
"I'm sorry."

308
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,600
Say "I'm sorry" one hundred times.

309
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,020
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,120
Yeong Wu's mom, I'm sorry.

311
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,350
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,480
You know what I said before?

313
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,350
I'm still sorry.

314
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,190
Why do I keep saying I'm sorry?

315
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,620
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,490
♫  Tonight's night sky is dazzling  ♫

317
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,860
♫  More than the daylight that was streaming down  ♫

318
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,170
Why are you disregarding the nice hotel stay that Yeong Wu gifted us

319
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,210
and are insisting that we come to a place like this?

320
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,730
I don't like hotels.

321
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,730
Do you even know this place?

322
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,570
I said I don't like hotels!

323
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,650
Let's go over there. There!

324
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,770
It's already mosquito heaven.

325
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,540
Su Gwang, hurry up!

326
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,120
♫  You might already know  ♫

327
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,470
You can even hear the waves here.

328
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,300
It smells like the ocean, too.

329
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,490
It's just a fishy smell.

330
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,150
Look over there. Over there. Look at the seagulls.

331
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,940
Squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk, squawk...

332
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,500
It's mosquito heaven!

333
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,360
♫  I feel like I can still get to know you  ♫

334
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,880
Su Gwang.

335
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,190
- I want to sleep here tonight. 
 - Sure.

336
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,140
But it's not my problem if you're sore all over in the morning, okay?

337
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,610
Okay.

338
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,870
Who's going to stop you?

339
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,220
Jeong Hoon.

340
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,800
Do you think Mi Su and I will be able to return to the way we were?

341
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,220
Decades have passed.

342
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,990
No one knew

343
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,590
except us.

344
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,940
Yes, Hyeong.

345
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,770
No one knows about this.

346
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,360
So...

347
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,640
just forget about it now.

348
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,210
Yeah.

349
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,660
Stay still!

350
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,900
What will you do? What will you do? Huh?

351
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,820
What will you do if you don't get the injection?

352
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,520
I've been too lenient with you!

353
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,610
Stay still! What will you do?

354
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,780
Stay still!

355
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,150
What are you doing right now?

356
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,470
Ms. Mi Su keeps r-rejecting the injection.

357
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,570
- What's your job? 
 - Pardon?

358
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,620
What is it that you do?

359
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,940
A-As a nurse,

360
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,420
- I manage Ms. Mi Su's health and keep her safe. 
 - Exactly.

361
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,560
I told you to take care of Mi Su,

362
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,200
not act as her jailer.

363
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,490
I'm sorry, Chairman.

364
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,080
Please forgive me just once.

365
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,460
Get out.

366
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,460
Chairman, if you could forgive me this once—

367
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,800
Get out!

368
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,550
Let go! I said let me go!

369
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,960
Secretary Cha!

370
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,790
Chairman!

371
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,010
Let go of me!

372
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,910
Let go!

373
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,310
Let go of me!

374
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,740
Let me out!

375
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,260
This chases away mosquitos, so don't take it off and

376
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,450
keep it on your wrist when you sleep, okay?

377
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,900
Okay. It's cute.

378
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,520
The moment you step out, you'll be ripped apart by mosquitos.

379
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,940
A mosquito's blood-sucking is limited to females,

380
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,770
but the reason female mosquitoes suck blood

381
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,700
is to get supplied with protein to lay eggs.

382
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,290
The method of finding a host

383
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,170
is through the carbon dioxide that an animal exhales.

384
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,690
In addition—

385
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,690
Wow, that's the correct answer.

386
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,660
How smart you are.

387
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,050
- Seul Bi. 
 - Huh?

388
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,600
There are people looking for you.

389
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,250
They might be your family,

390
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,350
so should I meet with them?

391
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,970
No.

392
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,460
Why not?

393
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,780
You can't stay by my side forever.

394
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,480
Su Gwang.

395
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,510
Can't I just not look for my family

396
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,920
and stay by your side?

397
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,690
What are you saying?

398
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,270
I want to be with you forever.

399
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:20,380
Hey, that's something you say to someone you like.

400
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,320
I like you.

401
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,130
That's because you have no one else to rely on but me.

402
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,380
It's not.

403
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,590
I really like you.

404
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,040
Fine. Let's say you like me. Like a friend.

405
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,250
Not as a friend.

406
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,590
I said I like you.

407
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,440
I like you.

408
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,300
I like you. I like you a hundred times.

409
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,070
Why?

410
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,490
Why in the world do you like me?

411
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,240
I liked you very much when we first met

412
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,730
and I like you even more after two years.

413
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,850
Spending all this time together

414
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,610
made me want to stay with you from now on.

415
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,720
I'm...

416
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,740
poor.

417
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll help you earn lots of money.

418
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,450
Everyone around me dislikes me.

419
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,100
Not anymore.

420
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,900
Mr. Wang and Ms. Smile like you.

421
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,900
If you stay with me,

422
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,010
you'll become miserable.

423
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,730
If we stay together, we'll be happy.

424
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,840
You don't

425
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,720
like me, Su Gwang?

426
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,130
 Don't think about it, Gong Su Gwang.

427
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,880
 Seul Bi will leave one day.

428
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,740
 Don't hold her back.

429
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,650
Why did I stay by your side

430
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,600
even though I knew this would happen?

431
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,790
It's okay.

432
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,290
Come.

433
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,550
Ah!

434
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,810
What's wrong?

435
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,480
Father.

436
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,170
As for today's biotech investment company review,

437
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,400
you do it instead of me.

438
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,830
Did Mother not know about Ms. Mi Su all her life?

439
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,480
Why are you curious about that?

440
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,470
Because I've never seen you like that with Mother.

441
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,780
Why do you keep probing into the past lately?

442
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,650
You told me not to harbor any feelings for Seul Bi.

443
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,310
Let's stop.

444
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,760
Is Seul Bi my half-sister?

445
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,850
Is that why you said not to have any feelings for her?

446
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,440
No.

447
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,370
Seul Bi isn't my daughter.

448
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,430
Then who is Seul Bi's father?

449
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:05,400
The problem you should be contemplating is Geumhwa Group and your future,

450
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,310
not the details of her birth.

451
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,250
Please answer me!

452
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,770
At one point, Mi Su also ran away like Seul Bi.

453
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,180
She returned after a few months,

454
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,720
but she was pregnant with Seul Bi.

455
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,350
Now stop your curiosity.

456
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:54,970
 Lucky Fish Shop

457
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,450
♫  The day you were by my side  ♫

458
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:06,580
♫  The sunny street was full of green leaves  ♫

459
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:12,070
♫  And everything in this world was joyful  ♫

460
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,690
I can't lose weight because of this. It's so good.

461
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,370
Hey! Did you have a good trip?

462
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,380
Did you eat a lot of delicious food?

463
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,100
You're back?

464
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:29,370
♫  Even if the world is suddenly covered in snow  ♫

465
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,810
♫  This whole world—  ♫

466
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,070
Hey! We haven't even opened yet.

467
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,530
Why are you drinking the alcohol we need to sell?

468
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,190
I'll buy it with my own money.

469
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,810
How much is it? How much do you need?

470
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,720
What's wrong with you?

471
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,300
If you are like this, stay home from the store and study for the civil service exam.

472
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,200
I don't want to.

473
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,940
I like it here where I can see Myeong Seong's face every day.

474
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,610
Aigoo. What a virtuous woman. A virtuous woman you are.

475
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,280
It's not like he likes you back.

476
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,480
Why are you rolling around in bullsh*t by yourself?

477
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,060
Fold 100 of these boxes.

478
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,690
Thank you, Myeong Seong.

479
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,630
Thank you.

480
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,110
Our mother will come to visit Seoul.

481
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,670
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

482
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,650
Hold on.

483
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,710
Yes, Mother?

484
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,490
Hey, how many times are you going to say sorry?

485
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,650
You can stop it now.

486
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,500
What?

487
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,030
Take this.

488
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,720
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

489
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,600
Hello?

490
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
 You said you run a fish store, right?

491
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,770
That's great!

492
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:44,620
I run six franchise stores in Seoul.

493
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,110
Deliver some fish there.

494
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,010
Me?

495
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,870
 You're good at spewing out the right words.

496
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:55,660
I feel like you'll only send good fish, too.

497
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,280
Spanish mackerel, frozen pollack, blueback mackerel, and cutlassfish.

498
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,670
This is good enough.

499
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,770
Thank you, but our store isn't that big.

500
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,570
What are you sh**ting out of your mouth?

501
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,900
If your store is small, you need to expand it!

502
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,010
Talk about the specifics with my employee.

503
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,140
Th-that girl. Hand the phone to that girl.

504
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,640
Okay.

505
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,380
Yes, Grandma?

506
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,730
I'm sorry.

507
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,210
I said I'm sorry one hundred times!

508
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,990
You happy now, b*tch?

509
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,460
Good job, Grandma.

510
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,200
Okay.

511
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,070
Aigoo, thank you.

512
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,590
Are there any side dishes you want to eat?

513
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,300
- Sausages! 
 - Sausages? Okay.

514
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,270
Give her a lot!

515
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,950
 This is a secret,

516
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,070
 to be honest,

517
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,010
 I'm the goddess of luck.

518
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,410
Fill it to the brim.

519
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,760
 Geoseong Private Loans | Dooil Trading Company

520
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,170
- Mr. Wang. 
 - Oh, you're here?

521
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,260
Have you looked into who the VIP is?

522
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,740
Yeah. I asked all the middle bosses

523
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,960
and I think it's the "deep pocket" of our loan company.  (Someone with extensive financial wealth/resources)

524
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,590
A deep pocket?

525
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,160
What kind of person is he?

526
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,280
I think he's a wealthy man from the second financial sector,

527
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,770
but I've never seen him, so I don't know.

528
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,950
Geez!

529
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,460
That girl...

530
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,140
I wanted to have you meet her once you came out,

531
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,230
but she ran away.

532
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,170
I'll let you know once I find her,

533
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,240
so try pacifying her once you meet her.

534
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,000
Compensation for the last 20 years.

535
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,230
You should receive that compensation, right?

536
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,460
Yes.

537
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,400
That bastard.

538
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,680
He's all messed up.

539
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,170
The chairman stepped out.

540
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,800
I know. That's why I'm here.

541
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,100
Get out!

542
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,530
 Cold and fresh

543
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,650
 Hiring employees

544
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,140
Recruiting employees?

545
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,890
It was so slow that you only had flies flying around.

546
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,430
Why are you looking for new employees?

547
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,420
I'll be delivering to Yeong Wu's grandma's franchises.

548
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,840
I'm hiring someone to drive the truck at dawn.

549
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,740
Recruiting employees.

550
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,400
Myeong Seong, you're a true boss now.

551
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,190
Boss!

552
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,880
Brother-in-law, Myeong Seong. I mean, Boss.

553
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,910
If you need more fish, just let me know.

554
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,670
I'll catch them if I have to.

555
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,570
- Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it.

556
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,850
I'll go around the franchise stores and greet them.

557
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,510
Okay.

558
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,320
I let Mr. Wang know,

559
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,950
so don't go home alone, okay?

560
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,160
Ask him to give you a ride.

561
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,790
I'll find my way home.

562
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,910
Miss Seul Bi!

563
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,790
Oh, he's here.

564
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,310
When do you want to go home?

565
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,240
I'll leave Seul Bi in your care.

566
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,010
- Sure. 
 - Don't worry.

567
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,370
Take care.

568
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,520
- Okay. 
 - Don't worry.

569
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,210
What's wrong, Seul Bi?

570
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,790
Su Gwang doesn't like me.

571
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,370
Huh?

572
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,910
Go Myeong Seong dares to reject Miss Seul Bi?

573
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,320
What are you saying?

574
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,000
Su Gwang doesn't like me.

575
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,470
 Bang's Chicken

576
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,810
I shouldn't let Seul Bi in here out of consideration for my Eun Joong,

577
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,940
but I can't reject her since she's raising our sales like this.

578
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,910
Eun Joong, hurry up and bring the chicken.

579
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,700
No matter how I think about it,

580
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,750
there's no reason for Myeong Seong not to like you.

581
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,700
I told him that I liked him, but he didn't say anything.

582
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,090
I confessed to him, but I got rejected.

583
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,320
Myeong Seong said he doesn't like you?

584
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,280
Yay!

585
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,790
Are you making fun of her right now?

586
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,570
Wh-Why?

587
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,410
I called dibs on Myeong Seong a year ago.

588
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,570
He's still Seul Bi's man now.

589
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,480
Whoa. Who are you to decide that?

590
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,710
Eun Joong, please go over there.

591
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,790
We're serious over here.

592
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,190
Eonni, I'm serious too.

593
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,600
Every day!

594
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,270
You don't have to be serious!

595
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,920
She's saving your life by taking Myeong Seong.

596
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,080
Go, go, go. Go. Go!

597
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,620
Aigoo.

598
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,810
Whoa. Miss Seul Bi, you got a phone?

599
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,830
Su Gwang bought it for me yesterday.

600
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,840
Doesn't it mean he likes her if he bought her a phone?

601
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,480
That's right, Miss Seul Bi.

602
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,900
Men don't spend money on women they don't like.

603
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,710
- Really? 
 - Of course.

604
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,390
I'm sure Myeong Seong likes Miss Seul Bi.

605
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,290
But Su Gwang never said that he liked me.

606
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:02,380
Aigoo. Then make him like you starting now.

607
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,470
- How? 
 - Wait, but...

608
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,060
Seul Bi is too nice to Myeong Seong.

609
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,800
- That's the problem. 
 - That's right.

610
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,970
A woman needs to bounce (off advances – play hard to get).

611
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,380
Bounce?

612
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,410
- Bounce, bounce, bounce? 
 - Geez, what a generation gap.

613
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,200
It's not like that these days.

614
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,370
Direct women are popular these days.

615
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,180
- Direct? 
 - Don't worry about what she says.

616
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,770
She's your rival.

617
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:31,570
Look. Listen to what this seonbae eonni has to say.

618
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:36,390
There are three methods to drive a man crazy.

619
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,080
What are they?

620
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,490
I'm especially letting you know because it's you.

621
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,240
Using this method,

622
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,040
99.9% of the men you go after will fall for you.

623
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,720
First, blink three times while looking at the man.

624
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,500
One, two, three. Like this.

625
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,160
One, two, three.

626
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,170
That's right. One, two, three.

627
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
That's right.

628
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,730
And then, open your lower lip.

629
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,700
This is the second method.

630
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,500
And make it pout.

631
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,940
Third, blow some air.

632
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,400
And you have to say, "Do something about me."

633
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,700
Oh, sh*t.

634
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,190
Now, try it!

635
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,340
One, two, three. And open. Blow some air.

636
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,280
"Do something about me."

637
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,270
She's good!

638
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,270
- You're here. 
 - Ajussi.

639
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,900
I heard Father disbanded the search team.

640
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,980
- Is that true? 
 - Yes.

641
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,840
Why all of a sudden?

642
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,880
Who knows? I don't know either.

643
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,570
 Seon Min Joon

644
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,530
Why did you do that?

645
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,110
You said you wanted to raise Geumhwa with your own abilities?

646
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,490
Go ahead.

647
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,880
I don't understand.

648
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,150
Does that mean you won't concern yourself with

649
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,270
where Seul Bi is or who she's with?

650
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,610
You should stop looking for her, too.

651
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,660
Then why did you do that two years ago?

652
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,120
If you were going to give up this easily,

653
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,980
why on earth did you do that then?

654
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,000
To Su Gwang. Why?

655
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,800
To become an executive,

656
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,400
contemplate the future of the company.

657
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,810
Not two years or six years ago...

658
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:52,000
Don't obsess over the past that has passed us by.

659
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,130
The past that has passed us by?

660
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,700
I guess something that big could be of the past, depending on how you feel.

661
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,980
I couldn't like you as a father,

662
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,180
but I respected you as a businessman.

663
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,650
But now

664
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,510
I feel so pitiful, Father.

665
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,200
I'm going to find Seul Bi.

666
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,680
I'll bring her back for sure.

667
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,670
Su Gwang, you're here.

668
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,110
Hello?

669
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,700
 Su Gwang, it's me.

670
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,060
 Lucky Fish Shop

671
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,080
Hurry up and say what you have to say.

672
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,550
Someone's waiting for me at home, so I have to hurry.

673
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,440
That woman...

674
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,170
Su Gwang,

675
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,240
I think the cancellation of your admittance into the Geumhwa group

676
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,750
was due to a misunderstanding.

677
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,810
So I mean to ask,

678
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,750
would you like to work for our company again?

679
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:59,950
It's a shame for your ability to rot in a fish shop.

680
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,320
What's wrong with a fish shop?

681
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,240
I'm used to it now, so it's fine.

682
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,030
I don't even remember studying business administration.

683
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,140
The two years that you suffered,

684
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,770
I'll compensate for everything.

685
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,000
The position and salary that you desire,

686
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,630
I'll even arrange a nice apartment for you.

687
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,210
Why?

688
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,310
Why would you do that?

689
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,290
You're my best friend.

690
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,210
Have you done anything to wrong me?

691
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,800
There's an unresolved case that I have a good suspicion about

692
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,220
but no evidence.

693
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,270
Do you know what that is?

694
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,320
No.

695
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,070
What is it?

696
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,800
I'm leaving.

697
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,930
What are you doing?

698
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,510
What's wrong?

699
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,990
Are you sick? Is something in your eye?

700
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,080
It's not working.

701
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,000
♫  Tonight your eyes are dazzling  ♫

702
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,640
♫  Shining brighter than the midday sun  ♫

703
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,490
- What are you doing? 
 - You don't feel anything?

704
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,770
Feel what?

705
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,000
What are you trying to do?

706
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,800
♫  It's dazzling, the sky tonight  ♫

707
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,000
♫  I'm trembling for some reason  ♫

708
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,060
I'm going to wash my face.

709
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,940
♫  A little different from usual  ♫

710
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,630
♫  You probably already know  ♫

711
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,160
Should I try bouncing?

712
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,270
Why is she doing that?

713
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,010
How cute.

714
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:01,580
♫  Even the wind is sweet, what do I do?  ♫

715
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,830
♫  Anywhere as long as I hold your hand  ♫

716
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,450
Bounce plan, step one.

717
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,820
You should go first.

718
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,210
I have plans.

719
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,590
I'm busy, too.

720
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,750
I'll go on my own.

721
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,990
I'm going to sleep. Don't talk to me.

722
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,210
Sure, good night.

723
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,280
♫  Everything seems to be a lie, fly in the sky  ♫

724
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,820
♫  Even the wind is sweet, what should I do?  ♫

725
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,910
♫  As long as I hold your hand  ♫

726
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:47,570
♫  I think I can fly anywhere  ♫

727
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:39,600
 Don't you miss, Ms. Mi Su?

728
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,000
 I don't think I can wait forever.

729
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,300
 I hoped you'd return on your own, but I think it might be too late.

730
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,670
 Let's go together.

731
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:56,680
 Mom wishes for me to be happy in the outside world.

732
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,530
 I'll make that happen for you.

733
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:02,400
 I'll let you and Ms. Mi Su live in the outside world.

734
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,970
 You just need to come.

735
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,790
 Contact me.

736
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,610
Chairman, we've stopped the search on our side,

737
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,820
but there are others who are looking for Miss Seul Bi.

738
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:44,890
I have a feeling it's Eunsung Capital.

739
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,000
My brother!

740
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,130
How are you doing these days?

741
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,670
Are you sleeping well?

742
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,230
Of course, Hyeongnim.

743
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,940
Thank you for worrying.

744
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,050
And you don't have nightmares?

745
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:16,630
 I'm not all that weak.

746
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:24,100
I wondered what happens if a female shaman sucks away your energy all your life.

747
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,300
Was Father too weak?

748
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,130
I see that you've been manipulating the backstreet dregs of society.

749
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,260
Do you still hang out with those types of people?

750
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,370
Did you call me this early to berate me?

751
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:45,730
I wondered if you're prying into Father's past activities out of curiosity.

752
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,470
Are you worrying about me?

753
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,620
 I have no desire to keep that female shaman.

754
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,500
 Neither do I wish to give her to my son.

755
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:01,610
I'm sure you're not looking for her to protect her.

756
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:06,000
Seeing how you called me first and asked me many questions,

757
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,200
I guess you're nervous about having her taken away.

758
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,920
You still don't know

759
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,070
how I'll react

760
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,730
if you steal that child from me, Hyeongnim?

761
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,310
Are you threatening me?

762
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,730
I'm your hyeong!

763
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,400
 What the hell will you do to me?

764
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,690
Resume the search.

765
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,700
Find her before anyone else does.

766
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,000
Understood, Chairman.

767
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,830
Manager Yeom!

768
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,970
Tell the guys to move discreetly for now.

769
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:00,530
And you're trying to reach Assistant Jeong, right?

770
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,750
Yes.

771
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,770
Son of a b**ch.

772
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,780
These boomers, seriously.

773
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,660
How incredible is this woman for them to do this?

774
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,520
 I will live an ordinary life for sure...

775
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,330
How did you even make this?

776
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,890
So skilled with your hands.

777
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,240
Hey, why do you hang a child's toy like that on your shirt?

778
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,980
- Throw it out. 
 - I don't want to.

779
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,470
- See you later. 
 - Okay.

780
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,210
What are you doing? Get in.

781
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,750
You go ahead.

782
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,570
I have business to attend to.

783
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,450
Sure.

784
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,360
Then... then please give me a ride

785
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,080
since we're going in the same direction.

786
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,690
You'll get scolded by Mrs. Bang.

787
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,800
Gosh! It's okay.

788
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,100
I'm used to it now, so I'm fine.

789
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,770
Hop in then.

790
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,570
 Lucky Fish Shop

791
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,840
This isn't it.

792
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,210
Hey, Oh Eun Su!

793
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,960
You're late. What are you doing standing there?

794
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,790
Your teacher called so many times and said you were an hour late

795
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,950
- even when you left on time. 
 - Okay, I got it.

796
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,490
Don't dilly dally and go straight to school!

797
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,650
Okay, okay.

798
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,970
Oh Eun Su, don't smoke!

799
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:47,220
Smoke?

800
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,930
That little piece of sh*t.

801
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,860
Have you seen my Eun Joong?

802
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,150
She left first.

803
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,530
Did she walk for her diet?

804
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,040
Do you have 10,000 won today, too?

805
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,910
Just give me a ride since it's on the way.

806
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,770
Nothing's free in this world.

807
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,600
It's 5,000 won if I take the taxi, but you took 10,000 won last time.

808
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,900
You're perfectly normal today.

809
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,280
Ajumma.

810
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,570
When would you be happiest to have your children by your side?

811
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,510
Is there ever a day that I'm happy with them? They're a nuisance.

812
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:25,940
I'd be comfortable if they're out of sight.

813
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,990
Really?

814
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,930
But when I was sick last time, Eun Joong cooked me some porridge

815
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,040
and Eun Su bought me some orange juice.

816
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,720
That's the good part about raising children.

817
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,990
But why do you ask?

818
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,430
Get in.

819
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,470
 Post

820
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,620
Pants are 10,000 won. 
  Seodong Market

821
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,500
Bags are 15,000 won.

822
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,610
Hey there, young man.

823
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,590
Wow, so charming!

824
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,400
- Oh my, look at the quality of this fabric. 
 - Sh*t.

825
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,500
- How dare you touch me. 
 - How dare...

826
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,790
Hey, you! So difficult!

827
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,570
Coming through.

828
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,500
Aigoo, he's so full of it.

829
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,150
 It's a traditional market in Seodong-gu.

830
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,690
 - Market? 
 - Yes.

831
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,490
 Okay.

832
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,380
 Keep it a secret from Father that we found her.

833
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,220
 Manager Yeom.

834
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,830
 You know that my father might forgive thugs,

835
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:48,570
 but he won't let it go if you pack your back pocket, right?

836
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:52,450
 I don't care much about pocket money like that,

837
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,080
 but you know how cheap my father is.

838
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,920
You scared me.

839
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,770
As expected, the two of them were together.

840
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,530
Yeah, Manager Yeom.

841
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,690
You said you could put a tail on him, right?

842
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,900
Yeah.

843
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,060
You were looking for me, right?

844
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,370
You said you know the woman that the VIP is searching for.

845
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,500
Of course. I know everything.

846
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,950
Where she is, what she's doing, and with whom.

847
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,510
Let's see, let's see.

848
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,250
- Let me tell you where she is— 
 - I know where already.

849
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,590
Then why did you ask to meet with me?

850
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,270
I need you to do something for me.

851
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:15,940
What is it?

852
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,740
Hello?

853
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,410
Yes, yes. Cutlassfish?

854
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:23,860
We have a lot.

855
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,350
Yes. Could you tell me your address?

856
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:28,640
Yes, and it's a distribution company?

857
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,200
Okay, thank you. I'll deliver it right away.

858
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,940
Okay!

859
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,000
 Seon Min Joon

860
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,190
Seul Bi, excuse me.

861
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,060
I'm going to make a delivery. Keep an eye on the shop.

862
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,800
Su Gwang.

863
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,000
Hold on.

864
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:09,780
Seul Bi, gaining customers' trust is more important than good luck in business.

865
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:13,580
The customer is waiting. I'll be right back.

866
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,170
 Yoosong Corporation

867
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,610
That's weird.

868
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,310
The navigation says it's here.

869
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:02,270
 Yoosong Corporation

870
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,270

871
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,420
 Yoosong Corporation

872
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,720
Is anyone here?

873
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,350
Fish delivery!

874
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:19,500
Is anybody here?

875
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,000
No.

876
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,470
What's wrong?

877
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,290
Where are you?

878
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:07,020
- Get him! 
 - No!

879
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,190
Su Gwang, where are you?

880
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:13,720
Think.

881
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,960
Where is that?

882
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:23,920

883
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,390
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

884

 Jinxed at First

892
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:01,730
 Seul Bi is in danger.

893
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,270
 Can't you tell me now?

894
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,710
 What kind of person you are.

 Come in for now.

896

 Tell him to bring her.

897
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,890
 How?

898
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:16,310
 Wh-What brings you to this lowly place?

899
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:19,140
