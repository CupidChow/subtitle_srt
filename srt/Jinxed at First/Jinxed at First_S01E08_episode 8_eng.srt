00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,790
 Episode 8

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,650
You little sh*t. You came here last night and got wasted again, didn't you?

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,420
It's more like you probably forgot to close the door.

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,660
Miss Seul Bi?

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,990
Mr. Wang.

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,000
How did you get in here?

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,860
You want me to lend you money?

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,000
Why?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,580
Please don't ask why.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,250
Well, how much?

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,390
How much do you need to get a house?

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,730
A house?

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,850
Why? I mean you put all that effort into decorating the rooftop.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,280
- Why do you need another house? 
 - Hyeongnim.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,010
Can't you tell, Hyeongnim?

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,580
She left the house after a lovers' quarrel.

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,630
That's why last night, Myeong Seong...

18
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,340
Miss Seul Bi, you should just make up with him.

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,100
Please lend me money.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,430
I'll work and pay you back.

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,390
Okay then, stay here for a minute.

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,690
I'll have a word with Myeong Seong.

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,280
- I'll go if you won't lend me money. 
 - Okay, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,230
I'll bring the money,

25
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,040
so just stay here for a short while.

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,520
Keep a good eye on Miss Seul Bi.

27
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,960
Hey, make her some instant coffee, too.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,050
Hyeongnim, I—

29
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,800
Seriously.

30
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,850
 The customer is not answering the phone.

31
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,280
 Please try again later.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,260
Why isn't this punk picking up?

33
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,990
Okay, here's another cup of coffee.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,770
- It would be so easy for you to earn money. 
 - Why?

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,930
Just as you did for Mr. Wang last time,

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,130
can't you see something if you just hold their hand once?

37
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,480
Even the most powerful shamans can't do that.

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,860
You just need to hold a hand and that's it.

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,070
You can earn money with that?

40
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,870
Yeah, of course!

41
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,120
You tell them their fortune and get money in return. From you.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,530
I have a girlfriend I'd like to marry,

43
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,490
and I wanted to check our compatibility anyway.

44
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,310
Can you take a look?

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,970
Lie.

46
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,050
She's not your girlfriend.

47
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,100
You just have a crush on her.

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,650
Wow. Wow, daebak!

49
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,770
Wow, you're really good.

50
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,570
Well, she's not my girlfriend right now,

51
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,270
but she'll be my future girlfriend, and we'll get married.

52
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,050
I'm hoping one day.

53
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,680
When you hear the siren,

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,840
stand at the crosswalk in front of the market.

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,090
Then she'll become your girlfriend.

56
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,400
My heart's fluttering.

57
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,030
I'm leaving.

58
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,210
This is for real, right?

59
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,440
Hey, what about the money for your house?

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,580
Yeah, okay.

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,410
I'll be right there.

62
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,300
- Yeong Wu's mom, haven't you heard? Come on. 
 - Okay.

63
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,550
- Where are you going? 
 - Mom!

64
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,270
Apparently, her godly powers are incredible.

65
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,960
- I'm so scared. 
 - What's there to be scared about?

66
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,510
The rumors have already spread!

67
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,310
Tell me your wish. Tell me your wish. Tell me your wish.

68
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,840
Okay!

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,280
A little something about our lady.

70
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,970
A touch of her finger and a single glance.

71
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,430
She can see a thousand steps ahead.

72
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,680
And with the energy of the universe,

73
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,660
she can bestow light upon our lives.

74
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,810
The Celestial Maiden of Light!

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,310
Oh my, oh my!

76
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,230
Seul Bi!

77
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,970
What is this situation?

78
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,090
Wait, so the incredible lady that the shaman brought was Seul Bi?

79
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,410
That swindling shaman.

80
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,260
We asked her for a suppressing ritual

81
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,300
and she's using her as the face of her business?

82
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,560
Shut up!

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,890
You need a strong ritual with the way your face looks.

84
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,090
You've done several!

85
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,280
Oh, did I?

86
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,330
Oh, right.

87
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,800
Okay then. Everyone should think of a question

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,570
and you just need to gently lay your hand on our lady's beautiful hand.

89
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,340
Okay, please form a line.

90
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,730
Yeah, let's see for ourselves.

91
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,500
If her abilities are that remarkable,

92
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,100
taking this path will be helpful to Seul Bi as well.

93
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,350
Aigoo, what are you saying when she has a fiancé?

94
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,300
Are shamans not allowed to marry?

95
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,710
Shamans! D-Do they get married?

96
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,610
I can't.

97
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,170
This isn't right.

98
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,150
This is not right!

99
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,610
Well, I want my fortune told.

100
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,490
- Oh my. 
 - M-Me too.

101
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,480
Then shall I as well?

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,800
- Hold on. 
 - I was...

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,670
Move.

104
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,260
Get in line.

105
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,420
 Lucky Fish Shop

106
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,640
Where did he go off to?

107
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,300
He's not even picking up his phone.

108
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,650
- Hello? 
 - Go Myeong Seong, why didn't you pick up?

109
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,000
Did you fight with Miss Seul Bi?

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,530
Hyeong, did you meet Seul Bi?

111
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,410
Miss Seul Bi was sleeping in our office.

112
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,850
And how big was your fight that Miss Seul Bi asked me for money to find a house?

113
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,800
I'll be right there.

114
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,210
Let the two of them fight.

115
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,350
Huh? Wait, pardon?

116
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,630
Just let them fight.

117
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,040
Don't stop them.

118
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,530
Okay.

119
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,040
Leave it to Su Gwang,

120
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,210
or else there'll be big trouble.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,760
- Big trouble? 
 - You must leave it to Su Gwang.

122
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,300
Okay.

123
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,470
She says there'll be big trouble.

124
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,900
Hyeong!

125
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,430
Did you guys fight?

126
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,760
Just get along, will you?

127
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,720
- Why do you keep hurting a woman? 
 - She's here?

128
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,180
Miss Seul Bi. What the?

129
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,490
What? You said Seul Bi's here.

130
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,070
Pi Tae Sik, that bastard. I told him to keep an eye on her.

131
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,570
What are you saying?

132
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,630
I think this bastard took her somewhere.

133
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,480
What? What happened?

134
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,250
I don't know. Pi Tae Sik, that bastard.

135
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,860
Thank you.

136
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,250
- Ajumma. 
 - Yes?

137
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,200
Stop Ajussi from going to the oil shop.

138
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,320
Wh-What?

139
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,460
If he goes to the oil shop right now, he'll be in trouble. Hurry up and get him!

140
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,700
O-Okay.

141
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Why? What's going on?

142
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,290
Police. What's the police's phone number?

143
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,070
Police?

144
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,970
Why aren't you picking up?

145
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,200
Honey! Where are you right now?

146
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,210
Huh? Why? I'm on my way to the oil shop.

147
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,700
No! Don't go.

148
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,510
Why not? They told me to get the sesame seeds we gave them.

149
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,800
No! She said not to go in! She said not to go to the oil shop!

150
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,780
You can't go into the oil shop.

151
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,490
 Come back. Okay? Hurry back.

152
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,610
D*mn it.

153
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,380
When you hear the sirens...

154
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,580
It's the sound of a siren!

155
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,730
When you hear the sirens, stand at the crosswalk in front of the market.

156
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,540
Crosswalk.

157
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,710
Oil shop!

158
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,760
What's going on?

159
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,170
Don't come near me!

160
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,300
Oh my gosh!

161
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,530
Don't come near me!

162
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,310
Don't...

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,440
 Kyeongil Marketplace

164
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,850
Eonni!

165
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,130
Drop the knife!

166
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,880
- Drop the knife! 
 - Don't come near us!

167
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,480
Geez!

168
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,850
Are you okay?

169
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,850
Are you hurt anywhere?

170
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,270
Talk to her? Don't talk to her?

171
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,600
It's dangerous! It's dangerous!

172
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,620
It's dangerous! Move aside!

173
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,030
Catch him!

174
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,610
- Drop the knife! 
 - Drop the knife!

175
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,270
Grab his arm.

176
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,140
His arm. His arm.

177
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,660
- Mr. Wang, thank you. 
 - Yeah.

178
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,100
What's going on?

179
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,970
Hey, your girlfriend made a report and prevented a big accident.

180
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,340
- Seul Bi did? 
 - Yes!

181
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,120
Hey, cuff him.

182
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,640
What's going on? Huh? Tell us.

183
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,550
He's my ex-husband.

184
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,350
He came after his business failed because he wanted to die together.

185
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,820
That f**king a**hole!

186
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,040
If he wants to croak, he should croak alone!

187
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,060
No wonder. A strange man has been hovering around here since a couple of days ago.

188
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,180
That's right! I saw him, too.

189
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,720
He was fully clothed in black clothes even though it's the middle of summer.

190
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,100
Then you should have said something! It could've been bad!

191
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,090
What about Seul Bi? Where is she?

192
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,410
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. This ajumma survived thanks to Seul Bi.

193
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,480
She's a sharpshooter! She hits bullseye every time!

194
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,310
Yeong Wu's dad is also alive.

195
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,160
Honestly, it's amazing!

196
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,840
She's so accurate. Very accurate.

197
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,560
- Oh my. 
 - Brother-in-law!

198
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,540
- Aigoo. 
 - Hey! What the...

199
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,460
What are you doing right now?

200
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,700
Geez, who keeps cutting the line?

201
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,460
Oh my, you're the...

202
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,980
- man with the pure soul— 
 - Come out.

203
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,390
I said, come out.

204
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,300
Lady...

205
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,810
L-Lady!

206
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,420
Let go of me!

207
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,120
I can earn money by myself

208
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,890
and buy a house on my own, too.

209
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,490
Everyone should stop telling me what to do.

210
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,300
Is that so?

211
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,350
You can earn good money in a place like this?

212
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,200
What you did in Geumhwa Hotel was also like this. Fortune-telling.

213
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,370
You abandoned everything and ran away because you hated it,

214
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,200
but what you're doing is basically the same thing.

215
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,060
Is this why you left?

216
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,560
No, Su Gwang...

217
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,950
I came to meet you.

218
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,260
You can see the future, but what happened that day?

219
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,750
You should've seen that day coming, too.

220
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,270
You should've let me know before Mom got into an accident!

221
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,720
You could've prevented it!

222
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,650
Why didn't you do anything? Why?

223
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,800
Su Gwang.

224
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,680
You shouldn't have left.

225
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,970
If you were going to do the same thing here, you should've just stayed.

226
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,060
♫  On a sunny day  ♫

227
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,030
I wish you didn't have that ability.

228
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,820
I wish that ability didn't exist.

229
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,900
Me too.

230
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,020
I want to become ordinary.

231
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,530
That's why I came to meet you.

232
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,110
That's why I abandoned my own mom

233
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,860
and came to meet you.

234
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,860
I guess I only thought about myself.

235
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,900
It's my fault.

236
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,220
I'll go back now.

237
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,830
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

238
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:56,610
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

239
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,140
Miss Seul Bi.

240
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,370
Mr. Wang.

241
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,650
Yes, Miss Seul Bi?

242
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,370
Give me a minute.

243
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,440
Okay.

244
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,930
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

245
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:21,450
♫  Because I know I can’t let go easily  ♫

246
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,780
Seul Bi.

247
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,810
Seul Bi!

248
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,200
♫  I guess I’ve been waiting for you all day  ♫

249
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,900
What about Seul Bi?

250
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,890
She said she's returning to where she used to live.

251
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,170
Miss Seul Bi wants you to open this when you get home.

252
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:26,250
Did your mom ever mention me?

253
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,720
You know my mom?

254
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,440
How do you know her?

255
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,330
I'm...

256
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,740
your dad.

257
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,030
I know that I have no right to say this since I'm suddenly appearing after 20 years,

258
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,000
but I'm really glad that I met you.

259
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,470
I don't know you, Ajussi.

260
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,290
Seul Bi.

261
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,410
I said I don't know you.

262
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,200
 Eunsung Capital

263
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,720
What the heck are you doing over there?

264
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,600
When are you going to bring that brat of yours?

265
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,190
Excuse me, Chairman.

266
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,180
Now that I told her that "I'm your father,"

267
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,720
we can smooth out any knots between us,

268
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,060
and finally, have some overdue conversations.

269
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,600
 "Your father went through hell for you,

270
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,380
 so you should help your father out now."

271
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,090
Then our Seul Bi who's like Sim Cheong has to say, "Yes, Father," 
  (TN: A girl in a folktale who sacrifices herself for her father.)

272
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,910
in order for me to bring her to you!

273
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,530
Just hold on.

274
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,580
Or just leave me alone!

275
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,990
Seul Bi.

276
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,560
Why does a bastard who's going to sell his daughter have so much to say?

277
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,140
Father.

278
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,730
What the heck do you want?

279
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,740
Honestly, why are you always yelling at me?

280
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,770
I have an incredible idea.

281
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,390
Hey, Jang Gyeong,

282
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,380
Mom said she'll meet with Chairman Seon tomorrow and

283
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,760
set a wedding date for you and Min Joon.

284
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,390
What?

285
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,900
Why would I get married?

286
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,410
What comes after an engagement?

287
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,330
It's marriage.

288
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,940
Rumors are flying that you visit Geumhwa Hotel every day to see Min Joon.

289
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,150
That you go around with a stupid smile on your face.

290
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,220
Gosh! Really!

291
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,250
Min Joon Oppa likes some other girl.

292
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,800
What?

293
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,020
Mom, I'm not getting married!

294
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,610
What do you mean why?

295
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,310
I ended my engagement.

296
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,080
Hang up! Geez!

297
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,360
Hey, then what about you?

298
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,620
- What about me? 
 - Don't you like Min Joon?

299
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,330
Min Joon likes someone else when you have feelings for him?

300
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,170
 Father.

301
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,340
 - Father! 
 - I did it.

302
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,440
 I did it.

303
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,030
Mi Su!

304
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,450
 Geumhwa Hotel

305
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,120
You can keep the promise that you made me, right?

306
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,500
I'll keep it without fail.

307
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,540
Min Joon.

308
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,100
Move aside.

309
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,320
Min Joon.

310
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,960
Min Joon!

311
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,470
I said, you can't.

312
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,040
It's Chairman's order.

313
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,160
We'll arrange Miss Seul Bi's own house.

314
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,290
Seul Bi isn't going anywhere else.

315
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,480
Min Joon!

316
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,410
Move aside.

317
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,000
That girl...

318
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,900
Kick her out.

319
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,510
You told me not to lose her to anyone.

320
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,120
I'm going to do as you said.

321
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,770
This girl

322
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,830
is a witch.

323
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,540
No.

324
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,130
She's just human.

325
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,010
Mom.

326
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,860
Mom.

327
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,840
Mom! Mom.

328
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Mom. I missed you.

329
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,330
Mom, I'm here.

330
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,010
Seul Bi is here.

331
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,880
- Mom. 
 - Who are you?

332
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,460
Mom.

333
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,980
Where's my Seul Bi?

334
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,610
Mom.

335
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,660
- Mom. 
 - Seul Bi.

336
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,950
Seul Bi... My Seul Bi...

337
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,830
Seul Bi. Seul Bi.

338
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,510
Mom.

339
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,100
My Seul Bi.

340
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,480
Mom.

341
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,390
- Mom, I'm right here. 
 - Where's Seul Bi?

342
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,050
Mom, I'm right here!

343
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,740
I came back.

344
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,410
Mom, I'm sorry!

345
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,620
Please find my Seul Bi.

346
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,050
Mom.

347
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,230
Mom, I'm sorry.

348
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,450
Mom.

349
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,220
Mom. Mom.

350
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,430
Mom.

351
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,950
 Mom, this is the place where you and Dad got married?

352
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,360
 Yeah.

353
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,240
 But how come you never came here until now?

354
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,540
 I resented your dad because

355
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,450
 he left too early.

356
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,200
 Why was he in such a hurry to leave

357
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,750
 that he died before even getting to see you enter kindergarten?

358
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 That's why I didn't want to come here.

359
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,670
 But now that our Su Gwang has grown up so well

360
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,050
 and has been hired by such a great company,

361
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,180
 I want to brag to your dad.

362
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,980
 How proud would your father be to see you right now?

363
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,940
 I don't remember a thing about Dad.

364
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,560
 Your dad will remember.

365
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,710
 He'll be watching down on you from up there.

366
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,910
 Su Gwang's dad,

367
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,670
 Su Gwang grew up to be a fine man

368
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,530
 and was hired by a great company.

369
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,450
 Aren't you so proud?

370
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,920
 We'll be back once we find a good wife for him.

371
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,810
 I only have eyes for you.

372
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,910
 Yeah right.

373
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,960
 You're the best.

374
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,480
 Aigoo. Don't lie.

375
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,040
 I'm serious.

376
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:36,030
♫  On a sunny day with the warm light, suddenly  ♫

377
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:52,700
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

378
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,210
 It's perfect! It's pretty, right?

379
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,380
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

380
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,800
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

381
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:15,750
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

382
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:22,870
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

383
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:30,340
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

384
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:40,010
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

385
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,370
You'll regret bringing that child back.

386
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,680
Sleep paralysis, depression, and delusions.

387
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,410
You've been receiving psychiatric treatment for a long time, Father.

388
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,220
Seul Bi isn't a witch.

389
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,200
Father, Seul Bi isn't a shaman of prophecy to me.

390
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,890
Then what is she to you?

391
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,930
The woman I love.

392
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,480
You've gone crazy.

393
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,960
You're the one who needs treatment.

394
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,570
I won't use Seul Bi's ability.

395
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,480
So don't worry about me ending up like you

396
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,540
by using the powers of a shaman.

397
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,310
I need to hurry and get back.

398
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,040
You should quit gambling. Yeah?

399
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,210
That woman has returned to the hotel.

400
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,130
Hey!

401
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,570
Why did you bring her back? I told you to pretend to look for her.

402
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,620
I didn't catch her.

403
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,550
She returned on her own.

404
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,970
On her own?

405
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,610
- Yes. 
 - Okay, you may leave.

406
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,680
So she returned on her own, huh?

407
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,510
To Min Joon.

408
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,140
What about Su Gwang?

409
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,670
Ajussi.

410
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,750
Ajussi, wake up.

411
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,860
- Ajussi! 
 - Yes! Prisoner number 2514!

412
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,360
Aigoo, Boss.

413
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,580
You reek of alcohol.

414
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,500
Oh, my stomach.

415
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,890
Eat slowly.

416
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,820
I'll make the morning deliveries,

417
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,230
so just look after the shop after you're done.

418
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,270
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,060
Hey! Myeong Seong, you're here!

420
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,400
Mr. Jeong, you're having breakfast?

421
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,210
Good morning!

422
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,370
- Aigoo. 
 - Everyone's gathered here.

423
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,650
But why haven't I seen Seul Bi since yesterday?

424
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,360
That's right. Bring her with you.

425
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,090
We need to thank her for saving my husband.

426
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,350
- Isn't Seul Bi remarkable? 
 - Yes!

427
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,930
You didn't fight because of her part-time job as a fortune-teller, did you?

428
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,700
Brides with upcoming weddings are usually busy.

429
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,550
She needs to choose her dress, order make-up service,

430
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,340
and get facials done.

431
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,800
- We're not getting married. 
 - What?

432
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,060
- Why not? 
 - Seul Bi won't come here anymore.

433
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,330
- She returned home. 
 - Oh my, she left?

434
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,460
Oh my. Brother-in-law, why did you do that? Bring her back.

435
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,710
Our Seul Bi...

436
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,280
Our Seul Bi went somewhere?

437
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,520
"Our Seul Bi?"

438
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,560
What is this wording that stimulates my curiosity?

439
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,380
Our Seul Bi...

440
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,830
Our Seul Bi.

441
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,030
My daughter left.

442
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,790
What are you talking about, Ajussi?

443
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,250
- Daughter? 
 - Daughter?

444
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,300
- Daughter? 
 - I wasn't hallucinating just now, was I?

445
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,720
Everyone heard that, right?

446
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,960
She's my daughter that I met after 20 years!

447
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,180
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

448
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,690
Seul Bi is Mr. Jeong's daughter?

449
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,920
Say that again.

450
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,760
Seul Bi!

451
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,320
Mom, this is a church.

452
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,790
It's a place where you pray to God.

453
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,950
Have you been there before?

454
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,790
This is Busan.

455
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,840
If you look at the ocean from here,

456
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,660
it's filled with blue water until the point where it touches the sky.

457
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,780
What are you doing?

458
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,380
I've arranged a place for you to stay,

459
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,470
so move there.

460
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,240
I'm not leaving.

461
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,560
This is the house I was born and raised in.

462
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,480
Why are you doing this now when you were so determined to keep me here?

463
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,390
What have you been doing outside?

464
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,370
How many humans have you met?

465
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,920
How many dirty hands have you touched?

466
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,600
How much misfortune have you seen with those eyes?

467
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,060
You are bringing those dirty

468
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,670
and disgusting things to Min Joon!

469
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,990
Dirty and disgusting?

470
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,450
This isn't where you can live.

471
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,820
Get out.

472
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,650
- Get out! 
 - Stop...

473
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,690
yelling at my daughter.

474
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,210
Mom.

475
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,680
Mom.

476
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,740
Mom, you remember me?

477
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,620
Seul Bi.

478
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,230
You're my Seul Bi.

479
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,740
My Seul Bi. I missed you, my Seul Bi.

480
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,820
Why did you come back?

481
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,380
I'm sorry, Mom.

482
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,370
Don't touch her!

483
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,600
Don't you dare take away my Seul Bi.

484
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,910
 Thank you for letting me meet Su Gwang.

485
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,010
 I pray that we'll always be together,

486
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,680
 and meet again if ever part ways,

487
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,030
 and meet again if we part ways again,

488
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,060
 and please let us love each other our entire lives.

489
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,100
 What did you pray for?

490
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,170
 It's a secret.

491
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,070
 Then this is also a secret.

492
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:50,000
 I, Love  
 ♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

493
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,230
 You  
 ♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

494
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:04,730
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

495
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,650
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

496
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,610
 I'm not going to tell you.

497
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,200
 - It's a secret. 
 - Tell me!

498
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,930
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

499
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:26,120
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

500
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:33,600
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

501
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:44,480
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

502
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,590
 If you meet bad guys, spray this in their faces and run away.

503
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,160
 Spray!

504
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,200
 It hurts!

505
00:33:52,200 --> 00:34:00,000
♫  The memories that were hidden by the darkness come back  ♫

506
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,900
 This is something called a whistle.

507
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,100
 If something dangerous happens to you, blow into it with all your might.

508
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,960
 So noisy.

509
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,530
♫  All of the feelings that I’ve forgotten are coming up  ♫

510
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,620
♫  My confused mind is bothering me  ♫

511
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,150
 Don't take this off.

512
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,330
 Sleep with it on your wrist, okay?

513
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,840
 What's important to me

514
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,310
 is you.

515
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,940
 You're the most precious to me.

516
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,760
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

517
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,960
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

518
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,040
Lies.

519
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,780
Everything was a lie.

520
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,770
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

521
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:57,850
♫  Because I know I can’t let go easily  ♫

522
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:08,410
♫  I guess I’ve been waiting for you all day  ♫

523
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,140
 I came to cancel a missing persons report.

524
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,400
 I'm the missing person.

525
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,340
 Gong Su Gwang.

526
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,730
 Family Court

527
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,920
Ajussi.

528
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
You contact me first and buy me a meal?

529
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,560
Life is full of surprises.

530
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,570
Ajussi, I'm...

531
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,270
returning back to Gong Su Gwang.

532
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,790
You still haven't found the bastard that tried to kill you.

533
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,100
What if it gets dangerous for you?

534
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,290
That's not why I discarded my old name.

535
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,690
Then?

536
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,100
I thought that nothing good ever happened

537
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,820
while living under the name of Gong Su Gwang.

538
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,660
Mom and Dad passed away early on

539
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,630
and there was no one to call me by that name.

540
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,150
There was no one to appreciate it.

541
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,270
That's why I discarded it.

542
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,140
I came to a realization after a certain someone

543
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,040
called me Su Gwang again and again.

544
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,010
That my name was well loved.

545
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,800
And that my mom loved me very much.

546
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,350
That's why I'm never going to abandon this name again.

547
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,190
Gosh.

548
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,500
Honestly, I feel so empty inside since Seul Bi left.

549
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,260
That's why we shouldn't have let her do the fortune-telling part-time job.

550
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,470
I mean, it is a little difficult for a man to marry her.

551
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,700
See?

552
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,210
You should've talked her out of it, but you just encouraged her.

553
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,180
Why are you yelling at me when everyone was so excited to have their fortunes told?

554
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,330
But you know Mr. Jeong who works at the fish shop?

555
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,400
Is he really Seul Bi's dad?

556
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,520
He says he is, but something's strange.

557
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,940
No. No way.

558
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,240
Seul Bi is the daughter of a chaebol family.

559
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,210
Do you think it makes sense that the fish shop's Mr. Jeong is her father?

560
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,770
Maybe it's like in the dramas where

561
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:41,020
the family's driver has a one-night stand with the daughter and—

562
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,000
That sounds like valid reasoning!

563
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,410
What nonsense are you spouting?

564
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,690
Please stop spreading weird rumors about Seul Bi.

565
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,020
Then... an adopted child?

566
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,520
What a drama.

567
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,830
Myeong Seong is coming. I'm going to go to work.

568
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,760
- Hello. 
 - Yes, Brother-in-law.

569
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,090
Myeong Seong, you're here?

570
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,090
Starting today, I'm Gong Su Gwang.

571
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,990
What?

572
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,430
My name...

573
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,720
is Gong Su Gwang.

574
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,220
Sure.

575
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,690
- Gong Su Gwang? 
 - What the?

576
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,010
He even changed his name after splitting with Seul Bi.

577
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,290
Seul Bi always called him Su Gwang from the start.

578
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,910
That's a little weird, too.

579
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,310
What to do?

580
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,760
Gong Su Gwang.

581
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,370
You scared me.

582
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,100
I've been watching you for the past couple of days.

583
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,040
What?

584
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,050
I was curious as to why Seon Il Jung sent you after these kids.

585
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,670
What do you mean, sent me?

586
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,140
I just came to see my daughter.

587
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,750
Did you agree to sell off your daughter?

588
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,870
- What are you talking about? 
 - How much are you going to get?

589
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,220
Stop saying nonsense and leave.

590
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,670
What a pitiful bastard.

591
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,850
- What? 
 - If you wasted 20 years in prison,

592
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,010
you should be grinding your teeth and plotting revenge.

593
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,510
But you attach yourself to the Seons again?

594
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,670
Revenge? And what if I die?

595
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,190
It would only be my loss.

596
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,370
Your daughter split with my son.

597
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,340
Then there's no reason for you to stay by my son's side anymore.

598
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,460
- Leave. 
 - He's not even your real son.

599
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,130
He said his original name is Gong Su Gwang.

600
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,340
Leave.

601
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,540
If you do my son wrong even in the slightest,

602
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,400
you're dead.

603
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,200
Are you comfortable?

604
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,100
Thank you.

605
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,770
Did you have lunch?

606
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,980
Yeah, I did.

607
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,380
Call me whenever if you need anything.

608
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,010
Sure.

609
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,250
Thank you, Boss.

610
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,540
And I'm sorry.

611
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,520
Stop drinking so much, Ajussi.

612
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,670
If you continue like this, I'll have no choice but to look for someone else.

613
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,780
I won't be like this anymore.

614
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,930
I'll make sure not to let it interfere with work.

615
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,790
Work is work, but you must also consider your health.

616
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,170
About Seul Bi...

617
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,960
Is she really your daughter?

618
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,040
Of course.

619
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,970
She's my daughter.

620
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,540
Does Seul Bi know, too?

621
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,950
I did tell her, but

622
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,290
a man she's never seen before shows up after 20 years and claims to be her dad.

623
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,550
How could she believe it?

624
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,530
Then...

625
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,190
are you also aware of where and how

626
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,750
Seul Bi was raised?

627
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,530
I was Geumhwa Hotel Chairman Seon Ju Cheol's assistant.

628
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,370
I met Seul Bi's mother then.

629
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,730
 I can no longer wait for you.

630
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,540
 Mi Su, I'm set up to inherit Geumhwa Group soon.

631
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,140
 I'll liberate you then.

632
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,380
 A little more...

633
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,330
 - Just give me a little more time— 
 - No.

634
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,160
 I can't trust you anymore.

635
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,470
 Mi Su.

636
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:50,640
 You don't want to leave!

637
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,340
 Let go. No.

638
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,860
 No!

639
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,330
 Please!

640
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,800
 Let go!

641
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,650
At Chairman Seon Ju Cheol's villa,

642
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,740
Seul Bi's mom who was living there...

643
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,480
I shouldn't have met her.

644
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,850
We shouldn't have met at all.

645
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,920
Is someone name Jeong Hyeon Tae my dad?

646
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,980
Did you meet him?

647
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:34,110
I'm very sorry to that person.

648
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:41,280
That person's life became very difficult because of me.

649
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,580
Okay.

650
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:57,100
What did she mean by, leave it to Myeong Seong— no, Su Gwang?

651
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,160
That's not it.

652
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,380
That's not it either.

653
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,470
And that's not it either.

654
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,970
For now, should I just leave everything up to him?

655
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,980
Gosh, why isn't this working?

656
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,150
Why isn't this awning unraveling?

657
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,010
What a mess.

658
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,370
What? What's wrong?

659
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,140
Mr. Park, don't just stand there and help me out.

660
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,380
All right.

661
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,530
Wait a minute. Huh?

662
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,350
Make Su Gwang do it.

663
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,500
Hold on a second, okay?

664
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,880
What?

665
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,840
Su Gwang?

666
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,870
Just come if I say so.

667
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,740
- Su Gwang. 
 - I need to look after the shop.

668
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,690
Su Gwang, help him with this.

669
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,500
Me?

670
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,260
Su Gwang, you're tall. You take care of this.

671
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,170
But I sprained my back, so—

672
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,440
Hey!

673
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,720
You must do it!

674
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,030
Give it a try. Hurry up.

675
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,590
- Yes, right there. 
 - Here?

676
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,210
Yes. Hit it a little harder!

677
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,470
Why won't it work?

678
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,420
Wh-What's Brother-in-law doing?

679
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,310
Keep going.

680
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,740
Maybe she wasn't talking about this?

681
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,250
What?

682
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,300
- There's something like that. 
 - What is it?

683
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,040
Yeah. Push it with your hands. Push it!

684
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,420
- Yes, that's right! 
 - You got it. You got it.

685
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,590
Okay, you got it.

686
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:33,680
It has begun, King of Misfortune!

687
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,210
What is this?

688
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,070
What's wrong with you?

689
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,800
Min Su!

690
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,330
What is all this?

691
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,550
Are you okay?

692
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,270
- Aigoo.
 - Is he all right?

693
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,700
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

694
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,580
You should be careful. You almost got hurt.

695
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,720
Thank you, Eun Jung.

696
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,370
Don't just eat chicken.

697
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,020
Man up and confess to her.

698
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,810
Hey, Oh Eun Su.

699
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,340
Why are you studying at a chicken restaurant?

700
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,240
Hey.

701
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,510
Go to a library.

702
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,800
I study better when I'm here.

703
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,340
Worry about yourself.

704
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,160
What? You little—

705
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,340
There you go again.

706
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,340
It hurts because I'm all bones.

707
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,300
 Let the two of them fight.

708
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,320
Which two people is she talking about?

709
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,430
Aren't you being too cruel?

710
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,260
To keep it a secret from your wife that you went home late because you were drinking—

711
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,130
- Those punks? 
 - Did I drink alone?

712
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,800
- You drank with me. 
 - Really?

713
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,410
Is it not?

714
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,870
Hot!

715
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,590
Look at this.

716
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,940
Those balls of misery?

717
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,830
Let's just leave everyone to fight.

718
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,240
Come here.

719
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,420
Come over here.

720
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,600
Su Gwang!

721
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,120
There's something else you need to help with.

722
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,980
Hold this.

723
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,810
Something terrible did happen a couple days ago,

724
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,600
and to keep the peace in Seodong Market,

725
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,810
the Seodong Market police and

726
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:06,970
the Seodong Market merchants will form a group

727
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,290
and patrol the market!

728
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,250
Our Su Gwang will assign the groups.

729
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,380
Why me?

730
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,670
Why would he do that?

731
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,790
She said to leave everything to Su Gwang.

732
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:18,930
Who said that?

733
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,480
Well, Seul Bi—

734
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,500
S-Someone wise said so. 
  (TN: "Someone wise" sounds like Seul Bi.)

735
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,030
He should be most familiar with the immediate geography of the market,

736
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,270
so we'd be grateful for his help.

737
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,720
- Please feel free to do so. 
 - Right? Here.

738
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,000
Hold on to this and assign the groups.

739
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,330
You must do it. Go on.

740
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,670
Go inside.

741
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,110
- Please come in. 
 - Go in.

742
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,900
Assign the groups.

743
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,360
This is nice.

744
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,950
Noona, I must be overflowing with talent in this area.

745
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,110
Yeah right. Look who's fooling around again.

746
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,340
Go and study.

747
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,990
Noona, try this.

748
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,540
It's really good.

749
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,280
Yeah?

750
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,150
Why are you bringing that?

751
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,610
Su Gwang!

752
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,240
Su Gwang.

753
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,450
Hello, Eun Jung.

754
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,180
Eun Jung.

755
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:40,830
Su Gwang, I heard your real name is Su Gwang.

756
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,480
Your real name is so cool, too.

757
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,570
This is a new menu item at our restaurant.

758
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:51,100
I brought it over because I wanted you to be the first to try it.

759
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,310
Me?

760
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:54,200
So would you like to try it?

761
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,890
I'm good at testing foods.

762
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,660
I always try the kimchi that my mom makes.

763
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,020
Am I your mom?

764
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,760
Here. Here you go.

765
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,840
Say "ah."

766
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,330
I'll eat it.

767
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,320
How does it taste like this?

768
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,350
You won't need a side of radishes for this.

769
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,440
It's refreshing and not oily?

770
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,250
No, the chicken tastes like radishes. It's sour.

771
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,790
I'm so curious. Chicken radish flavored chicken...

772
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,480
Then Officer Kim, would you like to try it?

773
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,370
Shall I?

774
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,910
It's so good.

775
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,520
It's so good.

776
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,250
Then you should ask Officer Kim to try foods from now on.

777
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,290
As if.

778
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,110
She's so pretty when she glares, too.

779
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,250
Is it really good, honestly?

780
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,050
It's sour.

781
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,960
What did he say? He said it's really good, right?

782
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,000
You fool.

783
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,590
Your tongue is a curse to the food industry.

784
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,500
Boo.

785
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,840
Who told you to give that ajussi what I made?

786
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,360
Tell him he doesn't need to eat it if he doesn't want to.

787
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,590
How dare you raise your voice?

788
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,320
You can't even make a sauce.

789
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,460
What?

790
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,190
I can't even make a sauce? I can't make a sauce?

791
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,450
You little—

792
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,420
 Just let the two of them fight.

793
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,630
 Don't stop them.

794
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,200
Fine.

795
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,620
Fight all you want.

796
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,200
Fight until you drop.

797
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,890
I won't stop you, so fight.

798
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,900
My head. My head. My head.

799
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:45,600
But what's going to happen if I leave them to fight?

800
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,610
So annoying. So annoying.

801
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,100
Geumhwa Biotech has decided to participate as a partner

802
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,010
in the Brain Science Research Center established by Jang Gyeong's hospital.

803
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,060
I'm aware.

804
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,550
I'm going to rush the wedding between you and Jang Gyeong.

805
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,860
Jang Gyeong and I broke off our engagement.

806
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,070
With whose permission?

807
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,710
The two of us came to an agreement.

808
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:17,360
The parties involved have made their decisions, so the adults shouldn't force anything.

809
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,070
My head hurts from the lawsuit and investments alone.

810
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,990
You think you have the company's best interest in mind?

811
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,860
You broke off the engagement at a time like this?

812
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,600
I'll make sure it doesn't interfere with the relationship

813
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,460
between Jang Gyeong's hospital and our company.

814
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,310
Seul Bi is not an option.

815
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:37,450
Why do you always blame everything on Seul Bi?

816
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:42,250
The company is in a difficult situation, but you're prioritizing your emotions.

817
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,890
You can't even resolve the investment problems

818
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,780
and you even ruined the business relationship—

819
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,730
I will

820
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,910
secure that investment.

821
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:09,070
I'll get rid of all the doors here.

822
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,100
Except for the final door.

823
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,040
I'll make it so that you can set the password and come and go as you'd like.

824
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:20,380
Let's paint the walls a pretty color.

825
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,910
And leave some plants on the floor.

826
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:27,880
You can do whatever you want.

827
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:39,920
I've arranged a stovetop oven and microwave for you,

828
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,770
so you can cook delicious foods whenever you want to.

829
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,180
I'll also change this room into a space you want.

830
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,670
You'll feel different once we change the interior.

831
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,570
I don't want to change anything here.

832
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,590
I want to leave it as is.

833
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,700
Silver Line Investment...

834
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,600
That's a dead end.

835
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,770
Look for a different investor.

836
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,470
Seul Bi,

837
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,290
I don't expect these things from you.

838
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,460
You don't need to do this.

839
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,710
You said you have something else to show me.

840
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,020
How refreshing.

841
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,230
I can drink in the wind, too.

842
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,060
I'm craving chicken and beer.

843
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:48,710
Chicken and beer?

844
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,720
Thank you, Min Joon.

845
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,410
Seul Bi, there's no need to do this.

846
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,930
This isn't why I brought you here.

847
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,840
Did Su Gwang give you that ring?

848
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,320
I forgot to return it to him.

849
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:35,610
Bring Ms. Mi Su and let her get some fresh air.

850
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,130
Okay.

851
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,280
Oh no, what happened?

852
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,040
What kind of ominous sign is this?

853
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,080
All our side dishes have gone sour.

854
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,770
What do I do? I just made some soy crab.

855
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,920
I'm in big trouble. I haven't even finished making the dough mix.

856
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,540
The power went out?

857
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,860
Mr. Park said he's going to bring Su Gwang to fix the electricity.

858
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,170
Did Su Gwang cause another accident or what?

859
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,310
Aigoo.

860
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,220
Someone go and turn the power back on!

861
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,830
Why did you tell me to do this?

862
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,550
You should've called an electrician.

863
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:34,490
No. You must absolutely do it.

864
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:37,280
Go ahead. Go ahead.

865
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,370
The power outage is because of Myeong Seong— Su Gwang, right?

866
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:48,030
- It's back! It's back! 
 - Aigoo.

867
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,710
Now it turns back on.

868
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,980
I could've been in big trouble.

869
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,600
I turned away two customers!

870
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,180
What a hot mess.

871
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,270
- Talk about being lucky. 
 - Thank goodness.

872
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,740
- You're here? 
 - Brother-in-law!

873
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,800
You saved my husband's life, Myeong—

874
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,300
I mean Su Gwang.

875
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,720
- I did? 
 - Yeah.

876
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,790
The power outage from earlier was Myeong Seong—

877
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,640
Su Gwang's doing, right?

878
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,450
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. 
 - No! It's fine.

879
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,440
So Mrs. Smile opened her fridge and...

880
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,080
 Oh no! All the fish are going to go bad.

881
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,040
 Honey, Darling, Kim Jeong Tae!

882
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,730
 Get up!

883
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,030
 Open your eyes.

884
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,600
Her husband got drunk and fell asleep in there.

885
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,400
- What? 
 - If there had been no power outage,

886
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,320
she would have closed the store and just gone home.

887
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,830
My husband almost froze to death.

888
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,390
Was she talking about this?

889
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,270
What?

890
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,810
No, no, no, no.

891
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,540
Stop talking.

892
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,300
Our Brother Myeong Seong is a man of good fortune.

893
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,700
Seul Bi absolutely has a good eye for men.

894
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,870
But why did you let her leave like that?

895
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,120
I miss our Seul Bi.

896
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,060
Why are you thoughtlessly bringing up Seul Bi in this situation?

897
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,020
Never mind that!

898
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,390
Hurry and take your husband home.

899
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,050
- Yeah, go home. 
 - Go, go!

900
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,050
Bring back Seul Bi.

901
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,450
- Hurry and go! 
 - Bye.

902
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:12,550
Was she really talking about this?

903
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,740
What is it?

904
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:48,440

905
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,540
 Octopus soup

906
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:50,350
 Raw octopus

907
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:01,660
 Extra food if you call for Myeong Seong's lady

908
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,850
 Lucky Fish Shop

909
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,020
Excuse me.

910
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,840
Are you Gong Su Gwang, by chance?

911
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,600
 A woman who comes looking for Gong Su Gwang, not Go Myeong Seong!

912
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,520
Do you know me?

913
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,390
Where is the female shaman of prophecy?

914
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,690
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

915
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:46,460
♫  Can't we start our love?  ♫

916
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,710
♫  The only place for my weary heart to rest  ♫

917
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:54,390
♫  It's in your arms  ♫

918
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,650
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

919
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:01,790
♫  Can't I embrace you?  ♫

920
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:08,790
♫  Even if I get hurt or in pain, I'll love you  ♫

921
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,380
 Jinxed at First

922
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,700
 The first man to hold hands with the female shaman

923
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,840
 will keep the most of her good fortune.

924
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,270
 Then there's no point in just bringing the female shaman

925
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,410
 unless you kill that man.

926
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,640
 You said she's your woman, right?

927
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,490
 If you can't even answer

928
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:23,850
 when asked about your relationship with her,

929
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,980
 you shouldn't take her out like this.

930
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,680
 Shall we go to meet the female shaman?

931
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,670
 Ma'am, I brought Gong Su Gwang.

932
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,730
 This is the same as Seul Bi's necklace.

933
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,610
 It was my necklace.

934
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,300
 What?

935
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,140
♫  I'll love you  ♫
