1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:10,920

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,320
Mom.

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,960
Why do we live only inside here?

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,170
Where should I start from?

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,090
This started from my grandma's grandma and…

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,050
her grandma's grandma.

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,910
 Long, long ago,

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,530
 there were women who could see the near future of the person they touched with their hands.

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,010
 Pigeons…

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,590
 A flying arrow…

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,990
 You can't avoid it!

12
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,490
 If they knew the future ahead of time, they could avoid bad luck and

13
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,040
 they could bring good luck.

14
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,910
We will have a daughter.

15
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,550
Then I will make her a princess.

16
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,240
 No one knew where those women had come from.

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,740
 It's just that the ability was passed on to their daughters.

18
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,290
 For hundreds of years, they had served as the female shamans of prophecy next to the kings.

19
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,070
 As the fate of the country declined and the world was in chaos,

20
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,770
 they left the palace quietly and became a part of the world.

21
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,720
 After that, in the war,

22
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,060
 a woman of the shaman's blood found someone who could protect her.

23
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,200
Please take me with you.

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,850
Whatever you wish, I will make it happen.

25
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,010
 The man who took the woman

26
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,240
 seized the opportunity to succeed in times of war and turbulence.

27
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,470
 He achieved great wealth and prosperity.

28
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,660
 He snuck her into his secret space and made her his own lucky talisman.

29
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,970
 Like that, the woman and her daughter,

30
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,830
 and the daughter's daughter are

31
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:45,440
 still separated from the world and living somewhere.

32
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,530
 Episode 1

33
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,930
Chairman Seon.

34
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,080
Prince Jamil of Saliha Group contacted me saying something came up and

35
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,810
indefinitely postponed the investment contract signing ceremony with Geumhwa Biotech.

36
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,840
Without giving us any reason on the day of the signing ceremony?

37
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,930
We're trying to figure out why, but nothing yet.

38
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,080
Even institutional investors are backing out now.

39
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,910
Only if the investment contract with Saliha Group is signed

40
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,800
is the launch of Geumhwa Biotech possible as scheduled.

41
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,180
Everyone, please leave.

42
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,370
The chairman is on his way.

43
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,070
 Handing over the bag…

44
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,640
Shaking hands…

45
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,360
That man…

46
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,540
Chairman Seon Il Joong.

47
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,490
Check if Eunsung Capital's Chairman Seon Il Joong is meeting someone from Saliha Group.

48
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,110
Chairman Seon Il Joong cooperated with Jinsung Pharmaceutical Company and

49
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,970
met and bribed an aide to Prince Jamil.

50
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,190
We secured the video and sent it to Prince Jamil.

51
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,180
Prince Jamil has promised to sign an investment contract with us as scheduled.

52
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,140
That's a relief.

53
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,120
Yes, Hyungnim.

54
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,470
Sam Joong, do you only think about how to get in my way?

55
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,650
 No way.

56
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,450
We were already working on the business you tried to invest in.

57
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,180
Why are you suddenly trying to jump into the bio business?

58
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,610
Can't I do what you can do?

59
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,660
How can you not let me take even a piece of it?

60
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,970
 You took the Geumhwa Group with your dirty tricks.

61
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,080
 As time goes by,

62
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,540
 you don't even feel guilty anymore, do you?

63
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,500
I didn't feel guilty 20 years ago either.

64
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,490
Then and now, you're the one who has a talent for the dirty tricks.

65
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,980
Sam Joong, this punk.

66
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,600
He's not respectful to elders.

67
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,340
Oh, right.

68
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,540
That child has grown so much.

69
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,390
It's about time her powers slowly show up.

70
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,760
Tell them to be extra careful.

71
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,520
Don't let anyone touch her.

72
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,540
Take this and this one out. 
  Where Did a Penny Go? | How to Make Money Selling Cookies

73
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,840
How many times did I tell you that books related to law, economy, politics, sociology,

74
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,200
and psychology are prohibited?

75
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,590
What are you doing now? Get out.

76
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,700
Lady Seul Bi.

77
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,560
New books!

78
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
Books! Books! Books!

79
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,590
What are these?

80
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,480
I've already read them.

81
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,350
I even read this 179 times! 
  Jellyfish

82
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,650
That book is worn out.

83
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,510
Turritopsis nutricula (immortal jellyfish) reverts to an immature state as aging progresses,

84
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,850
as if time goes backward.

85
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,890
If they were human beings, it's like they become old men

86
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,920
and then revert back to babies.

87
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,880
And then they grow again.

88
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,760
Since they repeat the process indefinitely,

89
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,610
they can live forever unless they are eaten.

90
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,800
This place is amazing!

91
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,500
Whoa, Min Joon, can we drink all that?

92
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,050
Aren't we going to get in trouble with Uncle?

93
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,350
I heard that my father went to the Busan conference.

94
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,340
- He won't be home until tomorrow. 
 - Nice!

95
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,600
Hey. So the chairman and you are the only ones living here?

96
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,160
After my mother passed away,

97
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,710
my father said he just feels comfortable here.

98
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,920
Wow, Seon Min Joon! How does it feel to use this entire hotel as a house?

99
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,430
It feels like I'm boarding.

100
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,470
Many people live together. They serve meals when it's time to eat.

101
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,440
Min Joon, let's exchange my father with your father so that I can board here.

102
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,330
Hey. Hey. Hey!

103
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,540
That's not okay.

104
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,160
My younger sister is engaged to the only son of the Geumhwa Group.

105
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,290
If he turns into Eunsung Capital's only son,

106
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,870
it seems like my sister is losing out.

107
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,240
Gong Su Gwang, what are you doing there?

108
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
- Come down. 
 - Come on!

109
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
Okay.

110
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,050
Lady Seul Bi, what are you doing?

111
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,610
Come here.

112
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,090
If you keep doing this, I'll report it to the chairman.

113
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,740
You are so petty.

114
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,710
Petty! Petty, times a hundred!

115
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,670
Bottoms up! Cheers!

116
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,810
Huh?

117
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,970
- Huh? 
 - Su Gwang.

118
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,500
- You have leftovers? 
 - Leftovers?

119
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,550
- You left some. 
 - I'll stop here. Seriously, stop.

120
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,850
Little Mermaid, do you really want to be human?

121
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,670
If you receive a kiss of love from a prince, you can become a human.

122
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,840
But otherwise, you will turn into sea foam.

123
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,430
Mom, when will I ever meet a prince?

124
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,510
When you grow up.

125
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,150
The chairman is going to let me meet the prince?

126
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,350
When?

127
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,680
When? I'm all grown up!

128
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,850
- Seul Bi. 
 - Yes?

129
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,370
Meeting the prince may not be so happy after all.

130
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,450
Mom, that's just a fairy tale.

131
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,060
Lady Seul Bi.

132
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,390
It's time for Ms. Mi Su to take a rest.

133
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,800
It's also time for you to take a nap, Lady Seul Bi.

134
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm not sleepy at all though.

135
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,310
Su Gwang is really amazing.

136
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,690
He was a Geumhwa Group scholarship student from middle school to college.

137
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,980
He hasn't graduated yet, but he has already entered the company!

138
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,700
Hey, Su Gwang, you'll have to be loyal to Min Joon for the rest of your life.

139
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,060
That's Su Gwang's ability.

140
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,290
Not just any company can take the top business student from Hankuk University.

141
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,150
Only our company is able to afford him.

142
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,010
So let's get down and party, Gong Su Gwang!

143
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,960
Hey, it's boring! Let's start the music!

144
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,540
What's this sound?

145
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,430
I'm not sure.

146
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,470
Say ah.

147
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,360
Every time I eat this, I get sleepy.

148
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,970
Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!

149
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,100
It's the biggest land animal and

150
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,550
uses its long nose to eat. Is it an elephant?

151
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,990
It's not an elephant, but a person?

152
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,790
A person?

153
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,000
Please stand up here. Let me introduce ourselves.

154
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,820
These are my friends. My name is Seon Dong Sik. He's…

155
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,750
- Are you insane? 
 - Oh, why?

156
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,000
It's been boring by ourselves!

157
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,270
Now we should have some fun. We've only been drinking!

158
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,090
Hello. What's up over there, Jang Geun?

159
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,990
Come out! You should say hello!

160
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,620
 Hey, you, come out!

161
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,830
 It's not supposed to be like that. Hello. Hello.

162
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,300
 Hello. Nice to meet you.

163
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,610
 Please follow Jang Geun.

164
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,880
 Two of you can follow me.

165
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,300
 The atmosphere is great, right?

166
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,340
 What's good when it's great? We should drink.

167
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,480
Prince?

168
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,750
 What are you doing over there, Min Joon? Sitting still?

169
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,490
 You sure do take after Uncle.

170
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,250
 Are you a statue or what?

171
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,310
 My uncle is...

172
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,650
Hi, Mom.

173
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,170
 Are you at the dorm?

174
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,280
I came out to hang out with my friends.

175
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,070
- Why? 
 - Just because.

176
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,480
Have fun and eat well.

177
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,900
Should I go see you, Mom?

178
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,500
That's okay. It would interfere with your studies.

179
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,680
I heard your voice, so it's okay, my son.

180
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,540
No. I wasn't even studying anyway. I'll come home.

181
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,040
Then will you come over for some fresh air?

182
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,900
 I will make your favorite stir-fried squid.

183
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,420
All right. See you later.

184
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,570
She startled me.

185
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,400
Lady Seul Bi.

186
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,510
Lady Seul Bi?

187
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,330
Hello.

188
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,880
- Aren't you going to pay the bus fare? 
 - Excuse me?

189
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,950
Hello.

190
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,310
Why don't you answer me?

191
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,290
Pay the bus fare!

192
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,760
- Oh, are you with her? 
 - Yes.

193
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,270
It's moving! It's moving!

194
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,830
Wow!

195
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,910
I'll eat it too. Squid.

196
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,380
At the Lucky Fish Shop. At Su Gwang's.

197
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,430
How do you know our shop

198
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,990
and also my name?

199
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,420
Look over there! There! Wow!

200
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,690
You've been following me from the hotel, right?

201
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,560
Are you staying at the Geumhwa Hotel? Are your parents also staying there?

202
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,990
Why did you follow me?

203
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,690
Prince.

204
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,110
Get off at the next stop and go back.

205
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,500
I'll take you there.

206
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't want to.

207
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,270
What should we do, ma'am?

208
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,670
We can't find her anywhere.

209
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,110
Just wear them for now.

210
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,930
It's beautiful.

211
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,160
 Lucky Fish Shop

212
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,610
Hello!

213
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,940
Belonging to the Beloniformes Scomberesocidae family,

214
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,070
you are a warm current fish, saury.

215
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,890
You are a mollusk squid belonging to the cephalopods family.

216
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,840
Hello. Nice to meet you.

217
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,610
I'm Seul Bi.

218
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,100
Do your parents work in a place like the Marine Ecology Institute?

219
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,140
Su Gwang!

220
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,760
- Oh my! My son! 
 - Mom!

221
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,710
Oh, my. Hey. I smell fishy.

222
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,760
It's okay. I like my mom's smell. I missed you.

223
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,840
I missed you so much too, my son!

224
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,480
How have you been?

225
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,740
Let me see you, my son.

226
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,860
Oh, hey! What happened to your shoes?

227
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,460
Oh, who is this lady?

228
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,350
- I'm hungry. 
 - Excuse me?

229
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,930
Squid.

230
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,070
Yummy! Yummy! It's yummy!

231
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,020
Thank you for enjoying it so much.

232
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,210
Take your time and help yourself.

233
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,710
I have to eat quickly and take her back.

234
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,330
I'm not going.

235
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,730
I'll stay here with Su Gwang.

236
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,930
She keeps calling me by name, "Su Gwang, Su Gwang."

237
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,680
Hey. Your parents must be waiting for you. How can you eat?

238
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,180
Oh! That's okay.

239
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,420
Take your time and eat a lot.

240
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,020
Bluefish...

241
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,990
Perciformes Scombridae?

242
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,160
Mackerel!

243
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,730
- Hey! Hey! 
 - What's the matter?

244
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,700
Mackerel!

245
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,980
- Hey! Hey! 
 - Mackerel!

246
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,470
- Hey! What's the matter? 
 - We need a lot of mackerels!

247
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,140
- Do you want to eat a mackerel? 
 - Mackerel! Lots! Lots! Lots!

248
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,220
- Are you saying you want to eat a mackerel? 
 - No, no.

249
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,680
We need lots of mackerel.

250
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,200
How many mackerels do you have here?

251
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,610
We need 200 mackerels.

252
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,430
We don't have that many.

253
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,460
We have them!

254
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,980
Someone ordered a large quantity yesterday and canceled it.

255
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,910
I was worried since I should throw them all away after a few days.

256
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,450
I'm so glad!

257
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,630
It's a relief for me!

258
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,490
I'm a school nutritionist.

259
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,160
But the delivery company said they couldn't come today because of an accident.

260
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,870
Thanks to you, I can serve a school lunch to our students today.

261
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,040
Please hurry up and give them to me.

262
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,400
- Okay. Mom, mackerels? 
 - Yes. There! There!

263
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,630
Mackerels! Mackerels!

264
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,300
Young lady, how did you know...

265
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,360
Don't call me a lady. It's Seul Bi.

266
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,130
Okay. Seul Bi.

267
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,840
By chance...

268
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,780
Mom, can I load all of these?

269
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
Yes.

270
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,600
Let me do it. Let me...

271
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,110
Alright!

272
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,930
Bye.

273
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,600
Goodbye.

274
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,830
Try these on.

275
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,080
I think they will fit well.

276
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,290
They fit perfectly!

277
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,570
They're so pretty! Aren't they?

278
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,590
They look so good on you.

279
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,960
Mom, why didn't you wear such nice shoes when you had them?

280
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,560
You wear old shoes all the time.

281
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,660
I saved them to wear to go to a nice place,

282
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,650
but I have nowhere to wear them.

283
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,570
I wore these shoes when I went to an amusement park with

284
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,760
Su Gwang's dad and Su Gwang when he was young.

285
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,620
It's a pair of shoes that only have happy and joyful memories.

286
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,410
Amusement park?

287
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,780
Is it where the train flips over in the sky and

288
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,550
the big ship moves like a swing?

289
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,070
- That's the place, right? 
 - That's right.

290
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,600
Wow! I want to go there too!

291
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,770
I want to go to an amusement park with these shoes on.

292
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,570
Gosh, she's so chaotic!

293
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,140
Hey, where do you think you're going?

294
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,780
Mom, I need to take her to the Geumhwa Hotel.

295
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,810
Amusement park!

296
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,820
- Come out now. 
 - Amusement park! Amusement park!

297
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,800
Mom, I'll buy you the best shoes when I get paid.

298
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,380
Let's go to many great places wearing them.

299
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,970
Okay. Thank you, son.

300
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,060
Hurry up and take her back to the hotel.

301
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,980
Goodbye!

302
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,590
- We're leaving, Mom. 
 - Okay. Take care!

303
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,350
Bye bye.

306
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,250
 Thank you so much.

307
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,980
- Look over there! 
 - Geez, this is crazy!

308
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,500
Excuse me. Excuse me.

309
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,540
- You want me to do it? 
 - Yeah, yeah.

310
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,800
Hurry up. Hurry up.

311
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,350
Drink it. Drink it. Drink it.

312
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,940
Now, cheers!

313
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,490
Clink! Clink! Clink!

314
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,660
It's really great, but I'm a little sleepy now.

315
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,620
Hey, stay awake.

319
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,590
Go up to Seoul. Right now.

 Geumhwa Hotel

321
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,800
Wow! It's an amusement park!

322
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,860
Amusement park!

323
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,100
They reopened?

Oh, it goes round and round.

326
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,900
This is a merry-go-round.

327
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,470
I'm so happy!

328
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,430
It's my prince!

329
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,270
What is this? It's so childish.

330
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,190
Here. Let's go now.

331
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,930
There's no one here. It's scary.

332
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,780
Let's hurry up and go now.

333
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,840
No. Hurry up.

334
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,050
What the hell are you doing here?

335
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,290
Father.

336
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,430
Hello, Uncle.

337
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,750
What the hell were you guys doing here?

338
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,540
We were just drinking a little bit.

339
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,030
Who else was here besides you guys?

340
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,850
We were the only ones here.

341
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,380
Get out right now.

342
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,040
I'm sorry, Uncle Il Joong.

343
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,720
- But— 
 - Get out right now!

344
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,150
You. Wait in the hallway.

345
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,290
Where is your daughter?

346
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,790
She's been stuck here for 20 years since she was born.

347
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,980
So I'm asking where she is right now.

348
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,060
Since she has nowhere to go,

349
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,010
she'll be back soon.

350
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,720
Are you sure?

351
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,500
She's on her way back.

352
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,720
Come on. Let's hurry in!

353
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,090
Oh, wait a minute.

354
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,030
Who are you?

355
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,050
It's you, Su Gwang.

356
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,390
Father!

357
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,930
- Chairman. 
 - Why are you doing this?

358
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,530
You ungrateful bastard!

359
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,210
Why are you doing this?

360
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,740
Send the guest's child back to the room.

361
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,200
Yes, sir.

362
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,150
He attempted to kidnap a hotel guest's child.

363
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,280
Take him to the police station.

364
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,000
It's a misunderstanding, Father.

365
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,570
Su Gwang just came to hang out with me.

366
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,370
Take him.

367
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,600
Take him.

368
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,970
Yes, sir.

369
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,020
Su Gwang!

370
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,630
Take away his cell phone too.

371
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,570
- Father. 
 - Chairman Seon.

372
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,400
Take it away!

373
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,380
Mom, I saw it.

374
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,850
The future of Su Gwang.

375
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,260
Su Gwang?

376
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,420
Follow me.

377
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,500
Who are those people?

378
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,260
They are female shamans of prophecy.

379
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,920
- Pardon? 
 - That girl is yours.

380
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,750
She will protect you from future misfortunes

381
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,010
and bring you good luck.

382
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,530
For that to happen, no one else should look at her, meet her,

383
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,800
or touch her.

384
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:07,020
She's a lucky talisman that exists only for you.

385
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,630
So...

386
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,700
don't let anyone take her away.

387
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,710
Tell me your mother's number.

388
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,000
I need your guardian to come here!

389
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,110
Tell me your mom's number quickly.

390
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,800
I'm here from the Geumhwa Group.

391
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,270
Your acceptance into the Geumhwa Group has been canceled. And...

392
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,940
you won't be able to get in touch with Min Joon anymore.

393
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,900
 Complaint Service Room

394
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:43,380
 6081

395
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,190
I'm sorry, Mom.

396
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,090
That's okay.

397
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,050
That's alright, Su Gwang!

398
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,810
Is that the only company out there?

399
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:07,360
You will get into a better company with your ability.

400
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,240
My son.

401
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,020
You've been doing so well all this time.

402
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,730
I'm fine as long as you're okay.

403
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,780
Mom!

404
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,270
Mom.

405
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,560
Mom! Mom!

406
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,140
Mom!

407
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,910
Mom!

408
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,270
Mom!

409
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,890
Mom!

410
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,000
Mom!

411
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,980
 Operating Room

412
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,070
Excuse me. The truck driver says he fell asleep behind the wheel,

413
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,800
so he doesn't remember what happened.

414
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,440
I took care of it so that people won't suspect us.

415
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,800
- And I took care of Ms. Min who was serving Lady Seul Bi. 
 - Chairman!

416
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,330
Chairman!

417
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,280
Chairman!

418
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,210
 Ma'am, give us some chicken gizzards!

419
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,150
 Min Joon, I heard that Su Gwang died.

420
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,660
 He killed himself.

421
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,810
 Only a suicide note and his shoes were left behind.

422
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,830
 They couldn't even find his body.

423
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,690
 Father!

424
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,570
 You ungrateful bastard!

425
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,670
 He attempted to kidnap a hotel guest's child.

426
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,000
 Take him to the police station.

427
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
- Min Joon! 
 - Father!

428
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,930
Father!

429
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,770
I heard that Su Gwang is dead.

430
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,780
Are you throwing a drunken fit in front of your father?

431
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,650
Father, Su Gwang...

432
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,860
My friend is dead.

433
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,980
Should I cry over that or something?

434
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,680
What did you mean by that back then?

435
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,590
 That girl is yours.

436
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:36,010
 No one else should look at her, meet her,

437
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,530
 or touch her.

438
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,040
By chance, did you do it?

439
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,260
From now on,

440
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,940
you take care of your belongings

441
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,830
on your own.

442
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,280
Father.

443
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,360
Could it be really true?

444
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,540
Please answer me, Father.

445
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,650
Min Joon, let's go.

446
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,090
- Father. 
 - Min Joon, let's go!

447
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,350
- Please answer me! 
 - Min Joon!

448
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,480
Father!

449
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,340
Please answer me! Answer me, Father!

450
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,460
Father!

451
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,200
He's gone for good,

452
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,680
so keep your daughter safe.

453
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,740
If this happens again...

454
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,070
You're going to kill my daughter too?

455
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,740
No.

456
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,240
Everything that happens from then on

457
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,340
is all your fault.

458
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,430
No.

459
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,600
He's not dead.

460
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,120
Su Gwang is not dead.

461
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,450
You're finally awake.

462
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,830
You've been lying there like that for three days.

463
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,780
Where is...

464
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,000
When I pulled up the net, it was so heavy that I almost broke my back.

465
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,780
So I thought I hit the jackpot.

466
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,860
I was happy thinking it might be a minke whale or a shark.

467
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,740
Unfortunately, some guy came up bleeding.

468
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,520
I felt like someone was trying to kill you,

469
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,040
so I called a health clinic doctor I knew and asked him to treat you.

470
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,790
Now that you've heard this much, you should thank me.

471
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,820
You should've let me die.

472
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,390
"He lost his mother and had a lot of debt,"

473
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,880
"so he got pessimistic about his life and committed suicide."

474
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,540
Are you the one the newspaper is talking about?

475
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,010
But it didn't seem like a suicide to me.

476
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,960
I wonder who was trying to kill you.

477
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,850
 A pessimistic man in his 20s, with enormous debt, lost his mother. Threw himself into the ocean...

478
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,620
Mom.

479
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,470
I miss Su Gwang.

480
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,680
♫  On a sunny day with the warm light, suddenly   ♫

481
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,610
Seul Bi.

482
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,590
Why do we have to live like this?

483
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,220
Why did you live like this, Mom?

484
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,600
Seul Bi.

485
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,080
I want to be an ordinary person.

486
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,880
I want to be an ordinary person and live in the outside world.

487
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:54,780
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

488
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,700
Lady Seul Bi, it's time for your injection.

489
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,880
- What are you guys doing? 
 - Mom!

490
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,750
Take her!

491
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,660
No.

492
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,140
My Seul Bi.

493
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,850
- No! Mom! 
 - Take her!

494
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,460
Mom!

495
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,610
Mom!

496
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:25,710
♫   Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?   ♫

497
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:35,920
♫   What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?   ♫

498
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:44,250
♫   Because I know I can’t let go easily   ♫

499
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:54,050
♫  I guess I’ve been waiting for you all day   ♫

500
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:03,710
♫  I've never hated the wind that blew at me  ♫

501
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:10,470
♫   Why do you bring back memories of you and shake me?   ♫

502
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:19,790
♫  I want to tell you not to come back  ♫

503
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:29,600
♫  I’m afraid you’ll disappear without saying a thing  ♫

504
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,460
This isn't much, but you will need it.

505
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,700
Thank you, Ajussi.

506
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,230
And this.

507
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,920
What is this?

508
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,160
Your name.

509
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,440
If you go up to Seoul, the people who tried to kill you might come after you again.

510
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,790
Use this name for a while.

511
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,530
Go Myeong Seong? 
  Identification Card: Go Myeong Seong

512
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,580
Strangely, he looks like you, right?

513
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,030
It's my son.

514
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,390
He died a year ago.

515
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,160
I haven't filed his death certificate yet.

516
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,440
From now on, you are my son, Go Myeong Seong.

517
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,620
 2 years later, Seodong Market

518
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,180
Should I take a stroll?

519
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,130
You can't help but buy this.

520
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,660
Buy one, get one free!

521
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,210
And I will follow you for free too.

522
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,890
If you take this guy, it'll be your loss, ladies.

523
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,110
Geez, President Park! I'm not following you!

524
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,450
Why is it so hot today?

525
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,240
When the hell is this heat going to end?

526
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,110
Tell me about it. It's so hot, right?

527
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,960
- Hello. 
 - Welcome!

528
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,530
 Yeong Wu's House

529
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,710
Here, here, here.

530
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,650
- Here. 
 - Hey!

531
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,200
- Here. 
 - Sir.

532
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,390
- Give us one kkakdugi (cubed radish kimchi), please. 
 - Yes, here you go!

533
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,840
Honey, Kim Jeong Tae!

534
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,370
What the hell is this credit card balance?

535
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,990
Am I the b*tch making money, and you get to spend it, a**hole!

536
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,870
Seriously! Where are you going?

537
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,880
Don't go.

538
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,120
Hey!

539
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,120
Mr. Kim, fighting!

540
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,020
Oppa!

541
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,520
President, did you see Jeong Tae? Jeong Tae?

542
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,490
Come on. Why do you call your husband by name?

543
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:27,820
What husband? He's not even a human!

544
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,360
What's the matter?

545
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,860
Oh, you've opened up the store.

546
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,550
Oh my, oh my.

547
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,800
Oh my! It's Go Myeong Seong!

548
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,010
Avoid him! Avoid him! It's Go Myeong Seong!

549
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,170
Go Myeong Seong! Go Myeong Seong!

550
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,710
You haven't opened it yet?

551
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,360
You're saying I shouldn't come this way?

552
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,590
Don't worry. I'll be your first customer.

553
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,130
Please deliver one fried chicken to me.

554
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:01,640
I don't want to! If you are my first customer, today's business is screwed!

555
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,360
Gosh! I shouldn't have talked to him!

556
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,990
Go! Go!

557
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,190
Go away!

558
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,610
Oh my!

559
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,610
Hey!

560
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,650
Oh, this precious salt.

561
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,000
I'll use it well. Thank you.

562
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,670
Let's go!

563
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,440
Why did she sprinkle salt on him?

564
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,320
He's a Seodong Market legend.

565
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,080
A man who carries bad luck like the wind or the clouds.

566
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,400
If you talk to him once or even touch him once,

567
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,090
he'll bring you bad luck for three days. He's a devilish person.

568
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:39,030
Gosh, there's no such a person like that.

569
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,950
That person, Go Myeong Seong!

570
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,510
He's coming. He's coming. He's coming!

571
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,210
Hello, we just opened a flower shop.

572
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,660
Oh, yes. Nice to meet you.

573
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,660
By the way, you're so handsome.

574
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,590
You'll be in trouble if you touch me.

575
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,630
Is it true, Ajussi?

576
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,590
Yes. You should be careful too, Miss.

577
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,380
They talked! They talked! They talked!

578
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,940
You are overreacting.

579
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:29,210
Thanks to your prediction, our company won a competitive bid.

580
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,950
This is your gift.

581
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,850
Aren't you going to open it?

582
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:48,190
You don't say anything to me except when you predict the future.

583
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,910
Please let me go outside.

584
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,080
Just once.

585
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,920
Please.

586
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,820
Hey, we'll collect money today, okay?

587
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,210
Okay. Okay.

588
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,130
Hey, Go Myeong Seong, what day was it yesterday?

589
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,950
I heard you're smart.

590
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,770
You said you were accepted into Hankuk University.

591
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,390
So why do you keep forgetting the day you should pay me?

592
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,230
If you keep bothering me, I can't run the business well.

593
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,080
Then I can't pay you back.

594
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,180
This punk...

595
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:50,670
Hey. Are you saying it's my fault that you can't pay me back right now?

596
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,150
This punk must be crazy, Hyungnim.

597
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,190
Only flies buzz around these days  (business is slow).

598
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,570
Can you catch them with me?

599
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,740
- Geez. 
 - This punk!

600
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,260
- Oh, I missed it. 
 - Myeong Seong.

601
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,280
Hello, President Park.

602
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,630
Mr. Wang is here again.

603
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:11,310
You know, the Fisheries Center says they need a delivery man.

604
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:14,010
- I see. 
 - Do you have time?

605
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,620
Of course, I do.

606
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:20,360
You should let Myeong Seong go make money.

607
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,290
Alright.

608
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,580
Director Seon! Director Seon!

609
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,940
Oh my! Oh my! Wait, wait, wait!

610
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,620
Lady Seul Bi is not allowed to go outside.

611
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,140
No. She will go out.

612
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,090
Seul Bi should have this much freedom.

613
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,830
- If the chairman finds out— 
 - Ms. Kim.

614
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,500
If you don't report it to him, he won't know.

615
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,840
My father is in Dubai right now.

616
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:00,930
Thank you.

617
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,230
Let's go.

618
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,020
But if you leave...

619
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,110
Let's go.

620
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:54,590
Seul Bi, I'm different from my father.

621
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,380
I think of you as my partner.

622
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,270
I'll treat you the best I can.

623
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:04,340
And someday, I'll let you live in the outside world.

624
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,570
Wait a minute, Seul Bi. Let me go over there for a second.

625
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,140
 Lucky Fish Shop

626
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,140
It's Su Gwang.

627
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,580
It's indeed Su Gwang.

628
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,210
He's Dr. Kang.

629
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:58,120
I've been asking around to scout him for Biotech, but it didn't work.

630
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,950
But I happened to run into him here.

631
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:04,190
As expected, you are the goddess of luck.

632
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,490
He's so cool. My prince.

633
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,900
Mom.

634
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,180
I saw Su Gwang.

635
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:25,410
I'll get out of here.

636
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,930
I'll go to Su Gwang.

637
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:58,850
 Exit

638
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,360
Seul Bi.

639
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,000
Get ready.

640
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,900
It's hot! My hand! My hand! Hot!

641
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,100
Are you smiling?

642
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,360
Is she crazy or something?

643
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,000
Secretary Cha asks you to bring us.

644
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,220
Secretary Cha?

645
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:18,590
Secretary Cha asked me to bring you two.

646
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,570
Secretary Cha asked me to bring you two.

647
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,400
Secretary Cha asked me to bring you two.

648
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,900
He asked me to bring you two.

649
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,800
Secretary Cha...

650
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,620
asked me to bring Lady Seul Bi and Ms. Mi Su.

651
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:41,690
Secretary Cha asked me to bring you two.

652
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:44,130
What's going on, ma'am?

653
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,660
- Secretary Cha. 
 - Ma'am.

654
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,960
What's going on?

655
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,590
What?

656
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,490
Why am I here?

657
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:06,730
Ma'am! Ma'am!

658
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:07,820
Why are they...

659
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,610
Oh, gosh! What's going on here?

660
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,990
Get them! What am I supposed to do?

661
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,940
 Get them!

662
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,730
What should I do?

663
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:23,930
Wait! Wait!

664
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,510
Nineteenth floor, A block, number 4. Check the screen operation.

665
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,770
Get them!

666
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,090
Wait. Oh, sh*t!

667
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,030
Raise this! Raise this!

668
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,410
Hurry up!

669
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,530
Mom, are you okay?

670
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,090
Hurry up and leave, Seul Bi.

671
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:10,890
- Mom, I'll just— 
 - You must go, Seul Bi.

672
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,430
Don't worry and leave.

673
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:14,700
For my sake.

674
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,690
You can do it, right?

675
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,230
What are you doing? Hurry up!

676
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:26,200
- Go. Go. 
 - Hurry Up!

677
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,220
My daughter.

678
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,740
I love you.

679
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,670
I love you, Mom.

680
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,350
Go!

681
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,750
♫  At first sight  ♫

682
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:31,380
♫  I knew you were the one  ♫

683
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,490
♫  Maybe you also knew that  ♫

684
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:39,350
♫  Looking at my trembling eyes  ♫

685
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,830
It's good to see you...

686
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,440
Gong Su Gwang.

687
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,150
♫  Please notice me  ♫

688
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:54,660
♫  I'll smile a little more  ♫

689
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,990
♫  I'll look at you a little more  ♫

690
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:02,390
♫  Please notice my heart  ♫

691
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:10,770
♫  Feel the feeling of walking on the clouds with me  ♫

692
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:19,220
♫  If you hold my hand, I can go higher  ♫

693
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,840
♫  I'm in love with you  ♫

694
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,330
 Jinxed at First

695
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,110
 Something's wrong with her, right?

696
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,000
 She seems like she's a little slow.

697
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,280
 I'm hungry.

698
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,670
 She seems odd.

699
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,680
 She's odd. Very odd.

700
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,470
 We have secured all 160 CCTVs and are checking them.

701
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,260
 We've set up a search team, so we'll find her soon, Chairman.

702
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,890
 I'll find Seul Bi.

703
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:44,770
 But if I find her, I'll treat her my way.

704
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:46,340
 - Don't trust him! 
 - Thief!

705
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,240
 You are right!

706
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,000
 Call the police!

707
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,320
 Su Gwang!
