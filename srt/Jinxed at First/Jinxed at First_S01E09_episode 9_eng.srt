1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,640
 Episode 9

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,600
Excuse me.

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,370
Are you Gong Su Gwang by chance?

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,940

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,960
 You must meet her!

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,160
 A woman who comes looking for Gong Su Gwang, not Go Myeong Seong!

7
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,900
Do you know me?

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,070
Where is the female shaman of prophecy?

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,300
If you want your fortune told, go to the fortune-teller at the end of the market.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,740
There's no one like that here.

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,660
I'm not here to get my fortune told.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,200
I must have come to the wrong place.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,050
If you ever need me,

14
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,870
come to this place.

15
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,550
 Seoul Stone Culture Museum

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,590
 Seoul Stone Culture Museum Director Eun Ok Jin

17
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,550
You insisted you would only go through Silver Line Investment,

18
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,630
so investments within Korea became difficult.

19
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,580
That's why you went to investigate Silver Line Investment beforehand.

20
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,290
 Silver Line Investment...

21
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,000
 That's a dead end.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
 Look for a different investor.

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,300
You said that the former vice president of Eunsung Capital is currently the CIO, right?

24
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,360
Yeah.

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,740
We can't let Eunsung Capital be involved in Geumhwa Biotech investments.

26
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,810
Didn't you say that the Hong Kong investors are also in the country?

27
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,700
They plan to depart for Hong Kong today.

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,680
We need to catch them.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,050
What?

30
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,500
Hong Kong investors?

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,830
I thought you said if we just catch Singapore SG,

32
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,780
we could swallow up Geumhwa Bio.

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,420
It seems Director Seon Min Joon has pulled in the Hong Kong investors.

34
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,180
Geez!

35
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,630
When in the world is Assistant Jeong going to bring that kid?

36
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,110
How could he bring her?

37
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,740
- She went back to Geumhwa Hotel. 
 - What?

38
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,210
She went back?

39
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,090
When?

40
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,440
How do you know that?

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,690
This is why I told you to do as I said, Father.

42
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,030
When did it ever go well from listening to you?

43
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,450
Was there ever a time you listened to what I said?

44
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,960
Do as I say this time.

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,680
Whoa, your photos come out great.

46
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,920
Hello, Su Gwang's girlfriend.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,760
Or the Lucky Talisman?

48
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,930
Erase the photos.

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,850
I said, erase them.

50
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,000
There are a lot of eyes here.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
Let's go talk somewhere quiet.

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,590
I'll send you the address.

53
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,950
Both of you should come.

54
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,490
Let's be close friends.

55
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,660
Oh, right. I'm also meeting Su Gwang later.

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,400
We can meet him together. Right?

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,400
- This is great. 
 - Min Joon, let's go.

58
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,030
I'll see you later.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,300
 Lucky Fish Shop

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,600
- Dong Sik, are you sure it's here? 
 - Yes, it is.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,830
- Are you sure? 
 - Excuse me!

62
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,210
Boss.

63
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,330
Welcome.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,320
Su Gwang.

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,340
- Gong Su Gwang! 
 - Jang Geun.

66
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,060
This punk insisted we come to see you together.

67
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,270
You were alive and well like this.

68
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,120
It's been a while.

69
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,330
Hey, let's go for a drink somewhere, okay?

70
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,190
We need to hear how you've been living, and we should get together.

71
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,860
How does that sound, Dong Sik?

72
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,760
Of course, we should.

73
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,360
 The first man to hold hands with the female shaman

74
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,970
 will keep the most of her good fortune, right?

75
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,800
 And that man will become the female shaman's lover.

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,310
 So we must get rid of that man,

77
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,190
 so that someone else can take the female shaman's good fortune, right?

78
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,130
 Then simply bringing the female shaman is pointless.

79
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,540
 The lover...

80
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,090
 Unless we kill that man.

81
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,400
 He's already dead.

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,960
 Father, you're aware that he was dead?

83
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,300
 "He was dead?"

84
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,710
 Then that means he's come back alive?

85
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,030
 How do you know that?

86
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,100
 How did you know that he was dead?

87
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,410
 Well, I mean...

88
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,230
 What the hell are you trying to say right now?

89
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,880
 Geez, that temper of yours!

90
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,190
 Anyway,

91
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,890
 think about making that shaman's man stand on our side.

92
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,490
 If he becomes our ally,

93
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,680
 that female shaman will soon also be our ally.

94
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
Cheers!

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,840
- Why aren't you drinking? 
 - Cheers.

96
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,500
It's so nice to see you after so long.

97
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,790
- It would've been better if everyone could be here. 
 - Exactly.

98
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,570
Min Joon, you're here!

99
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,240
Come here.

100
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,710
Please come here.

101
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,510
Who is she?

102
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,310
Su Gwang's girlfriend.

103
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,900
Oh! You're Su Gwang's girlfriend?

104
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,100
I was wondering why Min Joon brought a girl here.

105
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,670
I almost misunderstood. Please sit here.

106
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,810
Come.

107
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,110
What are you doing, man? Sit down.

108
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,980
Please come here. Right here.

109
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,850
I'm going to the  restroom.

110
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,570
Sure, sure.

111
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,210
Hey, Jang Gyeong.

112
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,750
You saw the address I just sent you, right?

113
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,220
I don't want to. Am I your designated driver?

114
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,700
You like Min Joon.

115
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,600
Then now is the chance. Grab it.

116
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,750
I don't want to!

117
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,370
Why should I when he likes some other woman?

118
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,920
What's with this atmosphere?

119
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,890
When did you two meet?

120
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,510
A long time ago.

121
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,670
So it's been a long time.

122
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,470
We broke up.

123
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,520
What?

124
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,470
Hey, what to do with this atmosphere?

125
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,860
Should we try something fun?

126
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,700
Could you tell my fortune?

127
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,780
Hey, hey, hey! Are you drunk?

128
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,480
I mean...

129
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,180
Su Gwang's girlfriend is apparently very good at fortune-telling.

130
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,140
Really?

131
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,040
Quit it.

132
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,490
Don't mind him.

133
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,920
You should leave now.

134
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,530
This is a gathering for my friends.

135
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,980
You need to pay a fee if you want your fortune told.

136
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,460
Fee? Of course, I'll pay it.

137
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,770
If you take a look, that is.

138
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,310
Gong Su Gwang.

139
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,370
Let go of that hand.

140
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,510
Hey, I've been feeling really strange since a while ago,

141
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,650
but why do you keep taking care of Seul Bi when she's Su Gwang's girlfriend?

142
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,970
What's your relationship with her?

143
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,820
By any chance, is the other woman that Jang Gyeong spoke of...

144
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,760
Hey.

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,870
Are you crazy?

146
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,120
Is your relationship really like that?

147
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,880
Su Gwang, you...

148
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,940
you also knew about this?

149
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,850
Wow. I can't stay here any longer.

150
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,010
Jang Geun, wait for me. That punk...

151
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,580
Can you come outside like this?

152
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,590
How are you going to explain yourself to other people?

153
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,650
Your existence, without a single record of your name in this world.

154
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,020
How will you introduce yourself?

155
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,060
Stop.

156
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,560
You said she's your woman, right?

157
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,120
Then at least, you should make her feel confident in front of other people.

158
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,180
If you can't even answer

159
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,200
when asked about your relationship with her, you shouldn't bring her out like this.

160
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,500
Stop it, Su Gwang.

161
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,730
Hurry up and go back.

162
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,950
I feel perfectly fine.

163
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,190
What's stopping me from feeling confident?

164
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,400
Because I don't have a resident registration number (Korean national ID) like you two?

165
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,380
Because I lived caged like a zoo animal?

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,230
Or because of my weird ability?

167
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,970
I haven't adjusted to this world,

168
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,870
and I couldn't become ordinary.

169
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,300
And I'm very weird,

170
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,000
but I've never done anything to embarrass you.

171
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,250
I'll leave.

172
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,040
You're leaving?

173
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,280
Hey, let's drink some more.

174
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,260
Seon Dong Sik.

175
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,500
Stop it.

176
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,560
I was wondering why you met with Hong Kong investors

177
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,230
right after meeting with Singapore investors.

178
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,050
It's your masterpiece, right?

179
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,300
Wow, how appealing that ability is.

180
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,760
Min Joon, let's go.

181
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,540
Go ahead and ignore me.

182
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,560
You'll regret it.

183
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,040
You're that...

184
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,650
That's right.

185
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,230
I bought some prawns, right?

186
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,230
This is very embarrassing.

187
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,370
Jang Gyeong, let's meet next time.

188
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,830
Let's go together. I'll be your designated driver.

189
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,200
You can't drive since you drank anyway.

190
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,910
It's fine.

191
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,240
I want to go with Jang Gyeong.

192
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,950
Let's go together while chatting.

193
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,990
As expected,

194
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,930
she's quite the character.

195
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,730
Since when were you aware of Seul Bi?

196
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,190
It hasn't been that long.

197
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,490
Imagine how shocked I was after finding out.

198
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,180
Uncle was able to build his company that big

199
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,250
by imprisoning female shamans and having them read fortunes.

200
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,030
Does that make sense?

201
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,710
I couldn't believe it either,

202
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,570
but I...

203
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,310
couldn't report him since he's my uncle.

204
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,690
And knowing that the shaman who ran away was your girlfriend,

205
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,510
I especially couldn't.

206
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,070
Seul Bi and I have nothing to do with each other now.

207
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,090
Hey. So you're saying you'll just back away?

208
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,820
Man, you need to get them good.

209
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,120
Enter our company.

210
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,090
I'll give you the high salary that you desire,

211
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,580
as well as a luxury apartment and foreign car in full.

212
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,510
Let's hold hands and get Geumhwa good.

213
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,690
Dong Sik, don't manipulate me like that.

214
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,510
Hey, what do you mean manipulate?

215
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,550
We were all once friends.

216
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,580
We're still friends now.

217
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,370
If you're trying to reel me in because of Seul Bi,

218
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,520
- I'll decline. 
 - Hey. It's not like that, man.

219
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,530
Think about my offer.

220
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,080
Okay?

221
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,570
Then the bastard who was with the female shaman until now

222
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,650
is the bastard from two years ago?

223
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,150
I think so.

224
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,360
"I think so?"

225
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,350
What the hell do you do?

226
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,170
Look into it again.

227
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,310
Starting with incidents from two years ago.

228
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,270
What the hell is going on?

229
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,850
- Where's your house? 
 - Seodong Market—

230
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,060
Geumhwa Hotel.

231
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,720
That's right, Seodong Market.

232
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,210
I guess you moved from there.

233
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,300
But you're not living with Min Joon Oppa at the hotel, are you?

234
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,690
Min Joon also lives at the hotel, so...

235
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,460
does that mean we're living together?

236
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,550
- In the same room? 
 - No, not that.

237
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,680
Min Joon comes to see me often.

238
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,100
Then who did you live with at Seodong Market?

239
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,710
With Su Gwang. In one room.

240
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,870
Wow!

241
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,900
- You pack a punch. 
 - Quit it.

242
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,190
I might just book a room at the hotel and reside there long-term.

243
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,180
- You're joking, right? 
 - I'm telling the truth.

244
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,350
I think I could finish a novel that packs a punch if I reside there long-term.

245
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,870
A fiction novel?

246
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,200
You're a writer?

247
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,310
- Yes. 
 - Wow. I like books.

248
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,180
Really?

249
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,510
But the novels that I write are more comfortably read online.

250
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,850
How?

251
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,550
Please let me know later.

252
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,620
I'll send you the link.

253
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,940
Director? I've brought Gong Su Gwang.

254
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,130
You came earlier than I thought you would.

255
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,050
Do you know of a way for Seul Bi to

256
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,830
become ordinary?

257
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,880
You can say that.

258
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,890
How did you come to know?

259
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,690
It would be better to show you once instead of explaining it to you.

260
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,500
This is

261
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,550
the same as Seul Bi's necklace.

262
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,380
It was my necklace.

263
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,890
Pardon?

264
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,620
- Then... 
 - I was also a...

265
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,700
female shaman of prophecy like the ones you've met.

266
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,230
But I became an ordinary person.

267
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,060
How?

268
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,910
What happened?

269
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,330
Aren't you someone unrelated to Seul Bi now?

270
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,950
When you really want to make Seul Bi into an ordinary person,

271
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,980
please come back then.

272
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,590
But you mustn't be too late.

273
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,970
If you leave Seul Bi like that,

274
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,870
it's dangerous.

275
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,580
What are you saying?

276
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,370
Eonni, why are you contemplating so hard over a 15,000 won ($15 USD) shirt?

277
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,680
Don't contemplate!

278
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,170
Geez, honestly.

279
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,950
Su Gwang, why are you coming back so late?

280
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,320
Gosh. This one, this one.

281
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,850
How long will you contemplate over a 15,000 won shirt?

282
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,120
Oh my!

283
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,690
 - Beautiful! 
 - How do I look?

284
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,820
 Turn around. Turn, turn, turn, turn!

285
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,370
 Whoa!

286
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,740
Su Gwang, you're here.

287
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,750
Hello.

288
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,610
Tick-Tock is here.

289
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,720

 Right?

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,230
 Pick one, pick one, pick one.

295
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,520
 We have Arthropoda in the Decapoda Portunidae family.

 We have mollusks in the Octopoda Octopodidae family.

Okay, you can look forward to this.

303
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,770
A kangaroo jumps around in your head,

304
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,080
a jellyfish attacks inside your stomach,

305
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,860
and your eyes seem to be looking at waves.

306
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,820
It's so-called good hangover soup, dried pollack soup!

307
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,560
And gyeranjjim (savory steamed egg custard).

It's so delicious.

312
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,020
What a relief. Eat up, Mom.

313
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,950
Long ago, my father once told me this.

314
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,920
You can possess, but you should not love.

315
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,400
What a foolish thing to say.

316
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,780
To have someone by your side every day

317
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,630
and not give them your heart.

318
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,580
But I said the same thing

319
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,190
to my son.

320
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,880
How foolish.

321
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,030
I'll meet with Min Joon and convince him to send Miss Seul Bi away.

322
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,340
Father has been in the hospital

323
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,880
for 20 years now.

324
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,910
At that time,

325
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,390
if I hadn't returned with Mi Su,

326
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,730
could all this have been prevented?

327
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,880
Would Mi Su and Father both have been safe?

328
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,930
If I had just turned a blind eye when Mi Su ran away—

329
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,160
Hyeong, you didn't know back then.

330
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,540
No one knew something like that would happen, so

331
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,570
stop your self-reproach of 20 years.

332
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,970
It's not self-reproach.

333
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,870
If I blamed myself,

334
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,360
I wouldn't have manipulated Mi Su all this time.

335
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,070
Jeong Hoon, I'm just that kind of person.

336
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,440
A shameless person.

337
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,540
Come now.

338
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,410
I'm a fearful person who's shaking in terror that the same thing

339
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,310
might happen to me.

340
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,180
Hyeong, let's send them both away then.

341
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,540
If we send away Mi Su, then Seul Bi will naturally follow.

342
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,800
And you should forget about them.

343
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,950
If you're still anxious, then I'll follow them.

344
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,300
Now...

345
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,320
let's let Mi Su go.

346
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,920
Sure.

347
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,650
That's what we should do,

348
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,020
but she made my life the most mesmerizing

349
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,430
and the most miserable.

350
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,070
I can't send her away, Jeong Hoon.

351
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,450
My Su Gwang.

352
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,930
His broad shoulders seem to have shrunk to half their size today.

353
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,990
I should give him something tasty to eat.

354
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,870
- Where are you going? 
 - Move it.

355
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,990
You're giving this to Ajussi again, aren't you?

356
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,060
- I was hungry. Let me eat it. 
 - Shoo.

357
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,460
I worked really hard on this sauce.

358
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,610
You gave the chicken I made last time to that ajussi!

359
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,070
Are you crazy? Move aside!

360
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,830
And what did you call me?

361
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,340
A curse to the food industry?

362
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,730
Let me try yours.

363
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,990
 Just let the two of them fight.

364
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,710
 - Huh? 
 - Just let them fight.

365
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,780
 Don't stop them.

366
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,600
Have you really gone crazy? Let go!

367
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,860
- Let go. Let go. 
 - I won't let go.

368
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,580
I said let go!

369
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,250
Hey! You nuisances!

370
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,040
Get out!

371
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,810
Get out now!

372
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,540
Gosh! I can only take it so far. I tried.

373
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,580
Geez, look at all this.

374
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,850
Gosh, look, look...

375
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,280
They used up all the sauce for evening business.

376
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,950
What a waste of sauce. What should I do?

377
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,580
Gosh, oh, my world...

378
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,340
This is a whole new world of sauces.

379
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,830
Oh, it's so delicious.

380
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,860
Seul Bi,

381
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,510
you saw the big picture.

382
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,940
Seul Bi!

383
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,710
Mollusks in the Octopoda Octopodidae family.

384
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,790
Oceanic fish belonging to the Scorpaeniformes Hexagrammidae family.

385
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,440
Mollusk clams of the family Liliaceae.

386
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,950
Wow. Tick-Tock, you memorized everything perfectly.

387
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,960
It was perfect?

388
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,530
Yeah, it's perfect.

389
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,660
You're a perfect man, Yeong Wu.

390
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,400
Yeong Wu is perfect!

391
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,900
What's all the fuss, telling us to hurry over? I have a business to run.

392
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,070
What's going on? Why is he asking us to run over?

393
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,740
She said something miraculous happened.

394
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,450
Huh? Did Mrs. Bang win the lottery?

395
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,980
If she won the lottery, she would keep it quiet, not tell the whole neighborhood.

396
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,810
What the?

397
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,030
Is everyone here?

398
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,130
What's wrong?

399
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,470
- Would you like to try the miracle sauce? 
 - Sauce?

400
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,430
- Try it. 
 - Why?

401
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,050
It's perfect, right?

402
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,730
- It's perfect, right? 
 - No, it's not!

403
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,410
- Yeong Wu is perfect. 
 - Huh?

404
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,330
Yeong Wu, you're perfect...

405
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,080
and this sauce is perfect!

406
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,040
It's a perfect life!

407
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,200
Seul Bi, thank you!

408
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,170
- Mrs. Bang! 
 - Seul Bi!

409
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,600
Congratulations!

410
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,920
Bravo!

411
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,180
Seul Bi!

412
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,840
Mom, these are the photos I took at Seodong Market.

413
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,180
There are so many shops here.

414
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,100
This is a chicken restaurant.

415
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,810
And this is Yeong Wu's Restaurant.

416
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,580
And this is the kkwabaegi shop.

417
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,300
- It looks good. 
 - The kkwabaegi?

418
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,540
Mom, you want to eat kkwabaegi?

419
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,620
The kkwabaegi here is really delicious.

420
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,210
Yeong Wu and I went there to eat it every day.

421
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,090
I'll buy you some, too.

422
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,110
Hey, Min Joon. I think I need to go to Seodong Market.

423
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,840
Should I go and buy it?

424
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,100
No, hold on.

425
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,730
The castella powder here is not perfect.

426
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,420
Stop saying the word "perfect."

427
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,760
Hey!

428
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,810
Seul Bi is here!

429
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,470
Seul Bi! Our Seul Bi!

430
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,970
Mr. Kkwabaegi! Rake in all the kkwabaegis!

431
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,890
Seul Bi said she wants to eat kkwabaegi!

432
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,640
- Seul Bi? 
 - Seul Bi is here?

433
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,180
Seul Bi's here, and she wants to eat kkwabaegi.

434
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,500
Kkwabaegi?

435
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,560
Besides kkwabaegi, what else does she like?

436
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,400
Oh, she likes that.

437
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,110
- What about us? 
 - Side dishes!

438
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,420
Seul Bi! Sexy lingerie!

439
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,980
Yeah, sure. Lingerie.

440
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,700
- Lingerie. 
 - What? What? What?

441
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,070
What about Seul Bi?

442
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,590
Seul Bi is here, and she said she really wants kkwabaegi.

443
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,770
Seul Bi? Seul Bi is here? Hold on.

444
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,330
What should I give her?

445
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,220
Hyeon Tae? Seul Bi is here. Hurry and go see her!

446
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,270
Seul Bi. Seul Bi.

447
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,360
Seul Bi, my sister!

448
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,610
Seul Bi!

449
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,210
Do you know how much I missed you? You left without saying goodbye.

450
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,080
I was so upset I didn't get to thank you properly.

451
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,400
Thank you so much.

452
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,180
I'm alive thanks to you.

453
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,640
Seul Bi, you should've at least said goodbye before you left!

454
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,280
I'm sorry.

455
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,560
I missed you, Seul Bi Noona.

456
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,860
Yeong Wu, I missed you, too.

457
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,320
Seul Bi Noona, you're perfect.

458
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,580
Perfect, my foot!

459
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,510
Because you went and left like that,

460
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,360
I was so upset. So upset!

461
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,710
- Here. 
 - Seul Bi!

462
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,330
Seul Bi!

463
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,900
Seul Bi, thank you so much!

464
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,060
You told me to just let them fight, so I did and

465
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,550
a miracle sauce was created!

466
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,460
- That's a relief, Mrs. Bang. 
 - Why are you suddenly the star here?

467
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,080
Step aside.

468
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,180
Hyeon Tae.

469
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,360
- Come and say hi. 
 - Yeah, come here.

470
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,900
Come here.

471
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,760
Where are you going?

472
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,830
So unreasonable.

473
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,790
Because Myeong Seong's lady isn't here, the market is so dead,

474
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,430
and it's not fun at all.

475
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,970
What do you mean, Myeong Seong's lady?

476
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,770
I'll come by often to grocery shop.

477
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,190
You think you'll be able to come and face Su Gwang?

478
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,060
How tactless of me, huh?

479
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,350
Su Gwang!

480
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,860
You're done early with deliveries.

481
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,500
Brother-in-law.

482
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,140
Everyone had their chance to greet her, so let's go now.

483
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,420
- O-Okay. 
 - No, I still have stuff left to say.

484
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,370
- Seul Bi, come back soon. 
 - Seul Bi, call me.

485
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,960
- Have a safe trip back. 
 - I still have stuff to tell her.

486
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,820
- Seul Bi. 
 - Tell her next time.

487
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,270
I didn't even start.

488
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,260
What a cruel love triangle.

489
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,420
Young couples these days stay friends even after they break up.

490
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,480
Oh my, I couldn't do that.

491
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,100
Hello, Gong Su Gwang.

492
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,850
 All the misfortunes that female shamans prevent

493
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,990
 accumulate in their bodies and will one day explode.

494
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,660
 No one knows if the bad energy will destroy the female shaman

495
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,500
 or attack the person closest to her.

496
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,600
Why did you come?

497
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,470
Mom said she wants kkwabaegi, so I came to buy some.

498
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,640
Must you come in person to buy it?

499
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,300
Can't the hotel staff buy it for you if you ask them?

500
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,610
She's leaving now.

501
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,540
Don't corner her like that.

502
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,430
Are you...

503
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,780
feeling okay physically?

504
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,100
You don't have any weird feelings or anything like that?

505
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,900
Let's go.

506
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,530
Stop bringing her outside.

507
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,930
That's none of your business.

508
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,070
Seul Bi shouldn't come into contact with people.

509
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,440
Why not?

510
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,430
You two were once a well-known couple.

511
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,510
Are you embarrassed now?

512
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,920
It's not like that.

513
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,710
I'm sorry, Su Gwang.

514
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,770
I won't come anymore.

515
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,760
What is it now?

516
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,660
Why would Mom go there?

517
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,480
I don't know! Hang up for now.

518
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,840
Oppa, there's big trouble. Really big trouble.

519
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,950
My mom went to Geumhwa Hotel for a hotel stay-cation.

520
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,940
What?

521
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,300
 Oppa, get out of there for now. Get out of there fast.

522
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,770
 Get out of there, so you don't run into my mom.

523
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,970
I'll go and get my mom out of there.

524
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,300
 Hello?

525
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,090
 Oppa?

526
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,040
Oh my, Min Joon!

527
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,690
Director, hello.

528
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,330
Why are you calling me Director when we're going to be family soon.

529
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,470
I'm sorry.

530
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,910
It's not something you need to be sorry about.

531
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,990
My future son-in-law is so respectful.

532
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:59,470
Min Joon, our Jang Gyeong is quite eccentric,

533
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,820
and she seems to be writing a novel or such nonsense.

534
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,940
But our Min Joon doesn't hold such an absurd imagination, right?

535
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,170
Jang Gyeong is talking about breaking off the engagement on her own, right?

536
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,650
Director, I...

537
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,310
You don't look like his secretary.

538
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,630
And you are?

539
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,580
Hello.

540
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,760
I'm Min Joon Oppa's younger cousin.

541
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,760
Oh, younger cousin?

542
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,120
Oh my.

543
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,890
Director, which room are you staying in?

544
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,540
I'll come greet you later.

545
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,250
Will you?

546
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,520
Why did you say that to Jang Gyeong's mom earlier?

547
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,130
I thought you'd be in a difficult situation.

548
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,630
Jang Gyeong and I have already agreed to break off the engagement.

549
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,570
We're sorting it out.

550
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,460
Jang Gyeong likes you, Min Joon. It's true.

551
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,720
But I like you.

552
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,670
I said, I like you.

553
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,900
Why are you ignoring my feelings?

554
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Then you should've told her earlier that I'm the woman you like.

555
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,170
You couldn't even say that in front of that ajumma earlier.

556
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,790
That's what you think of me, Min Joon.

557
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,000
A magic lamp you want to keep hidden and only take out when you need it.

558
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm like a genie who lives inside that lamp.

559
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,030
You know...

560
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,970
if she's your daughter, you should've tried to say something to her.

561
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,210
It's okay.

562
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,040
Is she really your daughter?

563
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,360
Then...

564
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,200
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?

565
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,250
Do you feel anything?

566
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,960
Does anything come to your mind?

567
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,200
Numbers? Lottery numbers? If you see anything, say them aloud.

568
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,780
Nothing comes to mind.

569
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,080
I guess it's not genetic.

570
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,760
Gosh, if you only drink alcohol,

571
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,600
you're going to ruin your stomach.

572
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,830
Su Gwang.

573
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,910
Are you okay?

574
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,250
You drank again?

575
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,400
What about our Seul Bi? Did she leave?

576
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,220
Aigoo. Su Gwang will have to make all the deliveries tomorrow morning.

577
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,200
Why did you feed him so much alcohol?

578
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,740
That ajussi is such a troublesome character.

579
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,880
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

580
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,670
It's fine!

581
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,290
A person can cause some trouble in life.

582
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,390
Can anyone live impeccably without a single blemish?

583
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,850
Look at you.

584
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,610
You called Su Gwang unlucky if you found so much as a hair on his face.

585
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,420
Why are you so generous with this ajussi?

586
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,020
Shut up, you b*tch.

587
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,630
Sir, I thought you had a high tolerance, but I guess not.

588
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,530
Drink less next time and eat a lot of food.

589
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,110
I'll give you lots of extra food on the house.

590
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,400
Su Gwang, take him home.

591
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,350
- Thank you. 
 - Yes, get home safely.

592
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,380
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

593
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,360
A person can cause some trouble in their life!

594
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,480
Why are you all so pessimistic?

595
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,000
Did you ever give us any free food?

596
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,890
Gosh, President Park! You always ask for free food.

597
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,810
Is your life a free service?

598
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,900
What are you looking at?

599
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,700
- Oh my. 
 - What is she saying?

600
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,280
Mrs. Bang, she's got rose-colored glasses.

601
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,670
She's fallen head over heels.

602
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,060
Mom, why would you embarrass me like this?

603
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,640
Have a seat.

604
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:06,850
Did Min Joon have another younger cousin besides Dong Sik?

605
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,920
No, why?

606
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,610
There was someone with Min Joon earlier.

607
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,820
She's pretty and polite.

608
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,610
Oh, yeah. She's probably a maternal cousin.

609
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,920
Do you know how close I was with Min Joon's mom?

610
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,900
I never heard that she has a niece like that.

611
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,400
No one really talks about their nieces.

612
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,700
Forget that.

613
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,490
Mom, hurry up and go back home.

614
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,760
I told you I'm not getting married.

615
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,330
Why are you acting so immature like this?

616
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,300
I could burst into flames just thinking about you.

617
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,400
If you dare not marry Min Joon,

618
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,230
I won't hand over a single penny of your inheritance.

619
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,970
I don't need it!

620
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,190
That brat.

621
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,710
Have some of this and sober up, Ajussi.

622
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,560
Aigoo. Thank you, Boss.

623
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,460
And please speak casually.

624
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,630
You're Seul Bi's father.

625
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,900
Seul Bi's mom...

626
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,390
I really hated her.

627
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,290
The woman who ruined my life like this...

628
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,310
Why did she have to be at Chairman Seon Ju Cheol's house?

629
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,610
Why did she have to grab my hand?

630
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,340
I really hated her.

631
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:52,840
But looking at Seul Bi, she really takes after her mom.

632
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,130
Do you like my Seul Bi?

633
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,100
Don't like her.

634
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,340
Everything will change even if you like her.

635
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,450
She can't live an ordinary life.

636
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,080
Even though I had feelings for her, everything still changed in the end.

637
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,180
When the hell will you bring that punk?

638
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,500
He's actually very full of himself.

639
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,310
He sells fish in a fish market, but he still has pride.

640
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,170
I can't win him over so easily.

641
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,550
What can I expect from you?

642
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,910
Ever since you were young, if I brought you and Min Joon to a BBQ restaurant,

643
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,440
Min Joon would eat sirloin so well

644
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,030
while you would suck on a 50-won candy that came out as dessert.

645
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,540
You piece of 50-won sh*t.

646
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,140
Who do you take after?

647
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,870
Who do you think?

648
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,150
- You little! 
 - Whoa! Whoa!

649
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,100
Anyhow, Su Gwang is also riled up.

650
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,400
He'll come over to my side for sure.

651
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,100
Min Joon appeared with that female shaman tucked on his arm.

652
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,910
Who wouldn't be riled up?

653
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,760
Min Joon

654
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,910
tucked that female shaman on his arm

655
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,790
and came outside?

656
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,670
That's what I said.

657
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,950
Stop stuffing your mouth!

658
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,570
Geez.

659
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,120
I'm leaving.

660
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,660
Aigoo, that little—

661
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,070
Yes, Sam Joong.

662
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,110
I'm not one to meddle in your family's affairs,

663
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,050
but I was curious

664
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,310
if you even had any idea...

665
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,070
Have you gone insane?

666
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,460
Are you crazy?

667
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,660
Why are you doing this?

668
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,340
You took her to go drink with your friends?

669
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,030
What will you do if she gets her picture taken outside?

670
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,570
How will you explain her to Jang Gyeong's family?

671
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,640
Have you really gone insane?

672
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,270
Ajussi, I think Father's medicine is wearing off.

673
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,120
Please give him his medicine.

674
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,250
Min Joon.

675
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,860
You punk!

676
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,270
Chairman, I'll talk to him later.

677
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,130
Let's go to your room.

678
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,770
Why did you buy so much?

679
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,200
I didn't buy them.

680
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,050
I got them as gifts from the market people.

681
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:03,230
I met a lot of good people in the outside world.

682
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,760
But why did you return?

683
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,040
So I could leave with you.

684
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,910
Here, have a bite.

685
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,140
This is really good.

686
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,570
How is it? It's good, right?

687
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,750
I can buy you whatever you want at any time.

688
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,660
I can even make it for you.

689
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,710
Next time, let's go buy clothes together and visit Busan, okay?

690
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,280
Seul Bi, don't stay here.

691
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,560
Go where you want to go.

692
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,510
I...

693
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,260
would like you to go back.

694
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,420
Then do you want to go together?

695
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,430
If you come with me, then I'll go back.

696
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,020
Mom.

697
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,810
Why won't you leave this place?

698
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,850
It's not that you can't leave.

699
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,950
You just won't leave.

700
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,510
I also wanted to become an ordinary person.

701
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,260
But why couldn't you?

702
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,610
I missed that chance forever.

703
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,830
Because I made a mistake.

704
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,550
What mistake?

705
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,170
Yes!

706
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,590
Gosh, I just tried something different today.

707
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,510
Su Gwang, good morning!

708
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,180
Hey, how's my makeup?

709
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,750
I copied someone from the internet.

710
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,240
It's a badass eonni concept.

711
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,960
It's the trend these days, but she keeps saying it's embarrassing.

712
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,560
- Hyeon Tae, hello. 
 - Hello.

713
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,580
- You look cool. 
 - Right?

714
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,800
- Su Gwang! 
 - President Park.

715
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,030
What the hell! It's still morning!

716
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,230
Your eyes are bruised, and your face is cakey!

717
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,450
You're so clueless.

718
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,790
Su Gwang, you have to help me with something again.

719
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,660
President Park, enough is enough.

720
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,290
One would think Su Gwang works for the Seodong Market Merchants Association.

721
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,730
Should I give Su Gwang monthly pay?

722
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,110
You should if you can.

723
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,610
It's fine.

724
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,480
I need to bring some fish from the truck.

725
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,630
Mr. Jeong can do it.

726
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,080
Yes, yes. I'll do it.

727
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,080
Boss— I mean, Su Gwang made dried pollack soup for me,

728
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,350
so my hangover is gone.

729
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,440
Hyeon Tae, be careful.

730
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,270
Don't hurt your back.

731
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,770
Oh my gosh! Mom, it's so embarrassing!

732
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,570
What's so embarrassing?

733
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,750
Su Gwang, come in. It's important. Come in, come in.

734
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,190
Come here, come here. Come in.

735
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,300
This is the Seodong Market remodeling business support proposal.

736
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,140
If we do as the conditions state, they say the merchants will be provided with better loans.

737
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,340
The executor is Big Star Holdings?

738
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,840
- Yeah, yeah. 
 - Wait.

739
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,020
Isn't this a company that's related to Geoseong Loans?

740
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,630
Yeah, that's right.

741
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,860
They said that Big Star Holdings is the company that manages Geoseong Loans' investments.

742
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,130
But if we proceed according to this proposal...

743
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,990
Why? Is something strange?

744
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,180
I think you should meet with their CEO.

745
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,240
Meet whom?

746
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,920
The market is the size of a booger. Why are they so picky?

747
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,150
All right.

748
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,970
All right!

749
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,470
Ow, my stomach.

750
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,770
Why does my stomach hurt whenever I eat soy sauce marinated crab?

751
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,690
 The VIP is Eunsung Capital's chairman.

752
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,770
Whoa. It's a heart!

753
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,880
- Boss's female secretary? 
 - Sh*t.

754
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,340
Hyeong, it's not that way. It's this way.

755
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,660
Hyeong, we need to go collect money!

756
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,840
Eunsung Capital's Chairman Seon Il Jung?

757
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,310
Not Geumhwa Group's Chairman Seon Sam Joong?

758
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,830
Yeah.

759
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,020
Eunsung Capital has been looking for Seul Bi, too?

760
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,080
One side is Seon Il Jung

761
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,000
and the other side is Seon Sam Joong.

762
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,320
Maybe the two sides are fighting over Miss Seul Bi?

763
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,050
But is Miss Seul Bi that incredible

764
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,600
for both chairmen to be like that?

765
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,000
Shut up, you a**.

766
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,810
 When you really want to make Seul Bi into an ordinary person,

767
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,640
 please come back then.

768
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,240
 If you leave Seul Bi like that,

769
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,000
 it's dangerous.

770
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,260
Hyeong, could you look a bit more into Chairman Seon Il Jung?

771
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,580
Of course, I can.

772
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,970
I also have a bad feeling about the VIP.

773
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,560
Would someone who mobilizes a backstreet thug like our boss

774
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,340
leave alone a prey he once targeted?

775
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,140
That's right.

776
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,180
Make some time for her to go outside alone.

777
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,200
Geez, seriously.

778
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,620
Do whatever it takes to bring her outside!

779
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,790
I'm just taking a walk inside the hotel.

780
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,710
Still, always bring your bodyguards with you.

781
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,720
I'll call you when I'm done with work.

782
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,290
All right.

783
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:05,030
 He left.

784
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:12,860
Now, shall I go meet the female shaman?

785
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,310
Look who's here.

786
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,990
- Shouldn't we go? 
 - It's okay.

787
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,970
Leave them.

788
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,030
Su Gwang's girlfriend.

789
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,310
Oh, I mean... Min Joon's girlfriend, right?

790
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,120
You must be following me.

791
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,460
It's a coincidence.

792
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,790
I have something to tell you.

793
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,290
Do you have money?

794
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,420
Pardon?

795
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,010
The fee for fortune-telling.

796
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,000
You're so quick-witted.

797
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,770
The fee for fortune-telling.

798
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,540
Of course, I got it.

799
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,150
Give me some wipes.

800
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:09,640
I thought you might see more clearly without any debris.

801
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,610
This is so nerve-racking.

802
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,370
Chinese restaurant.

803
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,760
Pardon?

804
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,410
Go to the Chinese restaurant tomorrow and eat an order of boiled dumplings.

805
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,010
Chinese restaurant?

806
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,960
Then what will happen?

807
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,070
The fee for fortune-telling.

808
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,050
Oh, the fee?

809
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,870
I'll get good fortune if I go to a Chinese restaurant and eat boiled dumplings?

810
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,880
Which Chinese restaurant should I go to?

811
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,790
Seul Bi.

812
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,030
Seul Bi.

813
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,600
What's wrong?

814
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,890
Mom.

815
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,800
You...

816
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,240
Whose hand did you hold?

817
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,200
Seon Dong Sik.

818
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,270
What did you see?

819
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,890
A snake.

820
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,340
A snake that's coiled

821
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,800
and ready to spring on the weak.

822
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,570
Turn a blind eye.

823
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,630
Why?

824
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,550
There are times when we need to leave small snakes alone.

825
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,180
If we touch them carelessly,

826
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,350
they might grow into a bigger monster.

827
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:57,570
How can I turn a blind eye when I can see that people will become miserable?

828
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,300
- Seul Bi. 
 - You were like this back then, too.

829
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,730
"Be quiet." "Turn a blind eye."

830
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,520
Look what happened to Su Gwang's mom!

831
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,890
 You could see the future, but what happened that day?

832
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,460
 You should've seen that day coming, too.

833
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,370
 You should've let me know before Mom got into an accident!

834
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,830
 You could've prevented it!

835
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,540
 Why didn't you do anything? Why?

836
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,190
I'm sorry, Mom.

837
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,920
Even if you know the future,

838
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,420
you can't prevent some things from happening.

839
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,000
And...

840
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,420
we can't know the entire future.

841
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,620
The futures you see

842
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,600
are only brief moments.

843
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,600
We don't know what kind of future those brief moments will become.

844
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,320
So be careful.

845
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,150
Hello.

846
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,860
Y-Yeah.

847
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,170
Su Gwang.

848
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,570
Mom, that was Su Gwang just now, right?

849
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,460
They say clothes are like wings (clothes make the man).

850
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,160
No, Su Gwang always had wings.

851
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,280
- He's an angel. 
 - This crazy—

852
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,640
You have no right to look at me like that now.

853
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,040
What?

854
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,870
- Oh my! Hello, Hyeon Tae. 
 - Hello.

855
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,240
You must be living with your son-in-law.

856
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,830
Mom!

857
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,210
- So attractive. 
 - Mom!

858
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,760
Shut up, you wench.

859
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,880
He's charming the more you see him.

860
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,970
Eat up.

861
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,500
- Eat up. There's plenty. 
 - Okay.

862
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,730
Something entertaining will happen while we eat this.

863
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,970
- Something entertaining? 
 - Yeah.

864
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:18,300
We're currently experiencing the ability of a female shaman.

865
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,840
- President Park, please eat up. 
 - Sure, sure.

866
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,230
Boss, you too.

867
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,630
The dumplings here are very good.

868
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,140
I took a look at the marketplace remodeling proposal.

869
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,470
You're offering great conditions to take out loans.

870
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,720
Our company's philosophy is like that.

871
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,470
Win-Win.

872
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:49,060
The thing about remodeling business is that even if they get government funding for 70%,

873
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,430
the merchants will still have to pay 1.5 billion ($1.5M)out-of-pocket. One and a half billion.

874
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,450
Our merchants don't have that kind of big money.

875
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:00,180
So that's why we're offering low-rate loans for a big win.

876
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,660
They're basically remodeling for free.

877
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,890
And then you'll gulp down the bribe money?

878
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,300
What do you mean gulp?

879
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,190
How dare you treat me like a thug?

880
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,960
CEO, don't get so mad.

881
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,190
Hear him out for now.

882
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:28,930
It turns out that the authority to designate a contractor has been delegated to you.

883
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,360
Look.

884
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,300
The executor has to be delegated to meet with the contractor, arrange schedules,

885
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,990
and provide the merchants with compensation.

886
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,780
That's the only way things will be processed quickly and smoothly.

887
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,150
That's what you did with the countryside market and pocketed the bribe.

888
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:49,200
Later on, you even jacked up the construction fees and took money from the merchants.

889
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,640
- It wasn't just once or twice. 
 - Huh?

890
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,500
- Really? 
 - No.

891
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,490
There are moments when you need more funds while working.

892
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,720
So what do you want?

893
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,740
On top of that, the new shopping mall concessions weren't even properly addressed.

894
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,260
Then all the profits from the new shopping mall concessions will be taken by you,

895
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,700
and the merchants will be saddled with all the losses.

896
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,210
- You— 
 - N-No, no.

897
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,680
Conman!

898
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,090
Hold on.

899
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,480
Hold on.

900
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,100
Since President Park and the young boss here look like good people,

901
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,160
I'll offer you an especially nice proposal.

902
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,490
If I pocket bribe money, do you think I'll only fill my stomach with it?

903
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,880
President Park and Boss,

904
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,370
let's share everything together. Win-win.

905
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,660
How about it?

906
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,820
Is that not enough?

907
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,960
Then the commercial real estate concessions!

908
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,540
I'll give you my share.

909
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,620
And I'll even give you interest-free loans for the big win.

910
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,970
- Interest-free. 
 - I don't care for that.

911
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,160
I have no intention of participating in illegal activities.

912
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,400
Director?

913
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,090
Just the sound of that is refreshing.

914
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,470
A loan company provides interest-free?

915
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,980
- Huh? 
 - Seon Dong Sik?

916
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,470
Why are you showing up here?

917
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,210
Let me take care of this first.

918
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,400
I can explain all this.

919
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,430
- CEO Choi. 
 - Yes.

920
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,630
My father goes ballistic if anyone messes around with his money.

921
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,090
Do you know it or not?

922
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,300
Yes or no?

923
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,890
And you dare to use my father's money to your liking,

924
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,210
to share,

925
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,510
and don't even report to your superiors.

926
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,260
Did you pocket all the profit yourself?

927
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,830
- Director. 
 - Manager Yeom, come in.

928
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,570
Director, I can explain.

929
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,040
- Director. 
 - Take him away.

930
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,870
- Take him away. 
 - Yes, Hyeongnim.

931
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,710
- Director. 
 - Come with me.

932
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,030
Director.

933
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:46,280
Don't you remember that I helped you during the M&amp;A (merger and acquisition)?

934
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,760
- As well as manipulating stocks! Director! 
 - Hey!

935
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,750
You stay here.

936
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:57,000
I don't know what gibberish that jerk is spewing.

937
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,660
Su Gwang.

938
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,540
I need to make you my ally.

939
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,410
Please change your mind. It's not too late.

940
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,550
Join our company.

941
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,890
Please?

942
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,420
 Eunsung Capital has been looking for Seul Bi, too?

943
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,100
 One side is Seon Il Jung

944
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,950
 and the other side is Seon Sam Joong.

945
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,680
 Maybe the two sides are fighting over Miss Seul Bi?

946
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,280
You don't want to join our company?

947
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't.

948
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,570
I'm hurt.

949
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,820
Let's go, President Park.

950
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,190
Aigoo, yeah.

951
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,100
Let's not talk about work next time and meet comfortably.

952
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:48,460
Tell me the names of all the middle bosses who aren't loyal to your boss.

953
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,290
Pardon?

954
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,590
Good job. Good job.

955
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,540
Seul Bi!

956
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,680
Hello.

957
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,360
And why are you here?

958
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,660
I, uh...

959
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,280
I'll leave first.

960
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,500
Take your time.

961
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,430
See you next time.

962
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,690
- Goodbye. 
 - Yeah.

963
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,070
Come eat with us.

964
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,550
Seul Bi.

965
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,350
That's okay, right?

966
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,280
Sure.

967
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,980
Let's eat together.

968
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,260
- Hello. 
 - Mr. Wang!

969
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,380
President Park, what are you doing here?

970
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,300
Is this a popular Chinese restaurant? Am I the only one who didn't know?

971
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,760
The boiled dumplings here are famous.

972
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,770
- The boiled dumplings here are— 
 - Dumplings, my foot.

973
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,900
Miss Seul Bi asked to see me here.

974
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,850
- Seul Bi did? 
 - Yeah.

975
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,510
Oh, I see.

976
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:58,100
Seul Bi set up the game and played them.

977
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,750
- Played whom? 
 - Huh?

978
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,940
Nothing.

979
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,500
Good luck.

980
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,550
With what?

981
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,550
Hello.

982
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:09,960
We have a reservation under Miss Seul Bi.

983
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,660
- Miss Seul Bi? 
 - Yes.

984
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,490
- Please follow me. 
 - Okay.

985
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:18,540
Hurry up and find someone useful.

986
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,470
Mr. Wang?

987
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,470
Excuse me, I think you showed us the wrong room.

988
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,710
It's this room.

989
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,150
- Pardon? 
 - Hyeongnim.

990
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,160
It's him.

991
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:45,110
 Please enjoy the dumplings that person buys you.

992
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:49,480
 Buy that man a plate of dumplings.

993
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,000
Who is this person?

994
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,740
He is the Seodong Market Manager from Geoseong Private Loans,

995
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,570
Mr. Wang Yoon Ho.

996
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,870
Why didn't you say so earlier?

997
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,770
Is he loyal to your boss?

998
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,090
No, not at all.

999
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:03,270
But he's very low on the chain.

1000
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,760
I see.

1001
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,550
Low?

1002
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:12,360
Well, a reorganization does need a new wave.

1003
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,120
On top of that, I'm already acquainted with you, right?

1004
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,840
What?

1005
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,680
I don't know. I don't really remember.

1006
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,350
But who is he?

1007
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:26,100
Eunsung Capital's Director Seon Dong Sik.

1008
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:29,410
Oh, yes.

1009
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,410
You came here knowing I was here?

1010
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,200
Yeah.

1011
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,930
Why?

1012
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,200
Coming to the market the other day

1013
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,430
and today, too.

1014
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,270
Why do you keep doing this?

1015
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:57,870
I've received a lot of help from Su Gwang and Min Joon.

1016
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:01,200
I've only received and have never done anything for you.

1017
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,170
- That's not true. 
 - That's not true.

1018
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:11,280
When I didn't know anything and couldn't adapt to the outside world,

1019
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,440
thank you for taking care of me and helping me, Su Gwang.

1020
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,720
Thank you for letting me meet my mom again

1021
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,180
and come outside with ease, Min Joon.

1022
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,860
It might be uncomfortable for you two to be together,

1023
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,690
but I wanted to buy you something delicious at least once.

1024
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,440
- I considered meeting you separately, but— 
 - It's fine.

1025
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,580
Eating together is better.

1026
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,900
Thank you for understanding.

1027
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,770
I'm buying this with the money I earned,

1028
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,890
so eat up.

1029
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:49,420
What money did you earn?

1030
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,580
I told fortunes and received fees.

1031
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,330
What?

1032
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,010
Did you set up a fortune-teller shop inside the hotel?

1033
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,710
No.

1034
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:03,410
I've never ordered her to do that.

1035
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:07,530
Making me tell fortunes and not giving me money is worse.

1036
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,710
I can't eat this.

1037
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:13,720
Eat it!

1038
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,740
I'm buying you this with my hard-earned money.

1039
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:18,040
You can't let this go to waste.

1040
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,120
Hurry up and eat.

1041
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,610
Whose fortune did you tell and get compensated for?

1042
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:31,500
Seon Dong Sik.

1043
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,000
Seon Dong Sik?

1044
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,850
Why did that bastard—

1045
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,630
Why would you tell his fortune?

1046
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:37,670
Fine.

1047
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,640
Because I told him his fortune,

1048
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,360
Seodong Market has become safer.

1049
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,250
Hurry and eat.

1050
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:59,050
Seul Bi, you shouldn't continue to tell the future.

1051
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,580
You could be in danger.

1052
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,420
Thanks for worrying, Su Gwang.

1053
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:29,150
Reporters have latched on to our marketing team.

1054
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,870
Not only is the rumor about calling off your engagement to Jang Gyeong flying around,

1055
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:38,280
but there are also reporters asking if I have a mental illness history.

1056
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,750
It's not like they're fabricating stories.

1057
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:55,800
What are you scheming by manipulating my son?

1058
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,020
I'm doing what Min Joon wants.

1059
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,700
What do you think Min Joon wants?

1060
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,010
What?

1061
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:07,540
Do you have any right to talk to Seul Bi like that?

1062
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:15,950

1063
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:22,300
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

1064
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:26,100
♫  Can't we start our love?  ♫

1065
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:34,160
♫  The only place for my weary heart to rest is in your arms  ♫

1066
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,580
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

1067
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,470
♫  Can't I embrace you?  ♫

1068
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:46,630
♫  Even if I get hurt or in pain  ♫

1069
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,580
♫  I'll love you  ♫

1070
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,050
 Jinxed at First

1071
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:54,030
 Su Gwang is now our market's man of good fortune!

1072
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,120
 That's right!

1073
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,700
 You're trying to bring me down because of your obsession with that girl?

1074
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,270
 What on earth are you thinking?

1075
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,280
 Are you trying to take away your father's management rights?

1076
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,110
 Yes.

1077
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:10,560
 Because you continue to be like this, I keep wanting to try that thing called manipulation.

1078
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,330
 There's one thing you should keep in mind.

1079
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:17,750
 If she can't become ordinary soon, Seul Bi will become a witch.

1080
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:22,000
♫  You're my miracle  ♫
