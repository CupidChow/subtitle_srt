 Episode 11

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,700
Aigoo, aigoo.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,130
Aigoo, why are you carrying such heavy things?

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,010
You packed just about everything.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,570
It's a waste, Sir.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,560
Then should I throw everything out?

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,070
These are all important things.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,570
All the things the boss told me to hold on to.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,890
How important can they be?

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:32,450

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,850
 I have a favor to ask.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,210
 Give the toy that your secretary brings

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,520
 to Su Gwang.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,980
 You must.

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,060
Wait...

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,110
Why did you take that?

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,560
- Hey, don't touch it. 
 - Give it to me. Give it to me.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,870
Aigoo.

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,670
Aigoo. Hello, Director.

20
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,480
What's with your office?

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,100
I thought Geoseong Private Loans had a lot of money, but the office is the size of a booger.

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,920
I know, right?

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,440
What brings you to this lowly place?

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,830
Please have a seat first, Director.

25
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,270
- Coffee. Coffee. Coffee. 
 - Coffee?

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,810
Bring me all the materials from the previous CEO.

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,390
- Materials? 
 - USB.

28
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,540
USB?

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,000
Is this all of it?

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,430
I did bring everything,

31
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,000
but I haven't organized them yet.

32
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,730
This is definitely his office.

33
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,650
Anyone here?

34
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,240
Mr. Wang!

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,170
I mean, CEO Wang!

36
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,270
You've become CEO, but your office is the same.

37
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,240
- But there's a new female secretary. 
 - Hello.

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,070
Where should I put this?

39
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,850
Should I put it here?

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,840
No, no, no!

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,230
I'll put it on the desk.

42
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,200
That's the spot.

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,860
Why is everyone here?

44
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,990
To congratulate your inauguration, of course.

45
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,340
Seul Bi asked us to get you some gifts yesterday.

46
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,290
- Miss Seul Bi did? 
 - Yeah!

47
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,340
Aigoo.

48
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,540
Exactly!

49
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,080
We were so negligent.

50
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,970
You became CEO, but we didn't even get you a gift.

51
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,650
I'm sorry, CEO Wang.

52
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,070
CEO, congratulations on your inauguration.

53
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,560
- Miss Secretary, you eat this chicken, too. 
 - Thank you.

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,500
Aigoo! Everyone, thank you very much!

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,160
Thank you very much.

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,200
- You know... 
 - Put it here.

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,790
Wow, it's perfect!

58
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,650
I think I added too much ice!

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,790
Sh*t! Seriously! Why would you put that there?

60
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,600
- It stinks. 
 - Scared me.

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,000
Then where should I put it?

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,950
Spray it on the floor?

63
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,320
Ajumma, do you know who he is?

64
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,690
Who is he?

65
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,770
Who are you?

66
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,720
Oh, are you here to borrow money?

67
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
- Me? 
 - Hold on a sec.

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,210
I've seen him somewhere.

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,970
- Where was it? 
 - Where was it?

70
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,190
- Oh! 
 - You scared me.

71
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,590
Su Gwang's friend!

72
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,880
Huh? Su Gwang's friend?

73
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,790
Oh my, we all do business in the same market as Su Gwang.

74
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,800
He's Su Gwang's friend,

75
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,440
but he's also the son of Geoseong's money owner. The big hand.

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,860
Look at his hand. His hand. Wow, it's big.

77
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,390
- Oh my, oh my, oh my. 
 - Oh my!

78
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,630
- Oh my, your hands are so big. 
 - This is our restaurant's new menu.

79
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,360
- Please give it a try. 
 - No, thank you.

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
This will go bad if the ice melts.

81
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,980
Where's your refrigerator, CEO Wang?

82
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,320
- R-Refrigerator? 
 - Yeah.

83
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,280
- The refrigerator is broken. 
 - Broken?

84
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,320
Oh my, what do we do? This fish is sensitive and expensive.

85
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,990
Should we bring this to your house?

86
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,210
Aigoo!

87
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,200
- Hey! 
 - Oh my gosh!

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,690
What are you doing?

89
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,150
Sh*t! Seriously!

90
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,540
- Did you get everything? 
 - Yes.

91
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,820
Let's go.

92
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,750
Hey, hey! Don't step on it.

93
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,290
- Go! 
 - Sh*t!

94
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,810
I'm so sorry you have to leave like this.

95
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,570
Aigoo, my fish.

96
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,500
He's different from Su Gwang.

97
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,340
He's made of ice and thorns.

98
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,860
That's one rude, unlikeable bastard!

99
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,600
How does Su Gwang get involved with the children of wealthy families?

100
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,060
I should tell Eun Joong to learn from him.

101
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,190
My gosh. Let's just open the chicken and eat it.

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
What is all this?

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,870
Let's go meet Jang Gyeong together.

104
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,180
Why would I go with you to meet Jang Gyeong?

105
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,760
Jang Gyeong likes you.

106
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,330
She told me to make sure to bring you.

107
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,060
I didn't need new clothes.

108
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,230
It's not like you can wear the clothes you bought from the market.

109
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,570
This is pretty, too.

110
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,220
I bought this from Mr. Hong's shop at the market.

111
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,910
Seul Bi.

112
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,750
It makes me uncomfortable when you go to the market.

113
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,290
I'm just going there to meet people.

114
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,500
Is there anything I did for you that's lacking?

115
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,650
No.

116
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,150
You treat me more than generously.

117
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,930
Then let me know whenever you go somewhere.

118
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,950
And always bring your bodyguards with you.

119
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,480
All right.

120
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,340
And this.

121
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,780
I have a cell phone.

122
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,040
Use mine.

123
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,160
Su Gwang pays for that.

124
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,720
Will you continue to be in his debt?

125
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,900
Seul Bi.

126
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,340
Can't you go back outside even now?

127
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,690
Mom.

128
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,450
What do you think is a way for us to become happy?

129
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,680
What makes you happy

130
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,160
makes me happy, Seul Bi.

131
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,560
I thought about it when I went outside,

132
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,040
but you're unhappy

133
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,500
and Mr. Jeong is unhappy, too.

134
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,980
Everyone is unhappy,

135
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,750
but I can't...

136
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,500
I can't be the only one to become happy.

137
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,450
Seul Bi.

138
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,420
Mom, I

139
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,230
will find a way for all of us to become happy.

140
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,120
I think that's the only way I can become happy.

141
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,480
I found this person, Mom.

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,230
 Seoul Stone Culture Museum Director Eun Ok Jin

143
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,450
 Ok Jin,

144
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,140
 your aunt,

145
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,860
 went to a better place now.

146
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,980
 If you go outside,

147
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,820
 you must look for your aunt.

148
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,060
 Gong Su Gwang

149
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,750
Su Gwang!

150
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,350
Hey, Su Gwang.

151
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,680
Yes, Hyeong.

152
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,000
Hey, I...

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,400
I almost wet my pants because of this little thing.

154
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,290
What is this?

155
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:37,640
Miss Seul Bi said to deliver the toy that my secretary brings me to Su Gwang.

156
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,460
- Seul Bi did? 
 - Yeah, well...

157
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,660
No matter how I look at it, I think this is it.

158
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,390
Oh, this!

159
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,930
This was a USB!

160
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,280
No wonder this was mixed in with all the other USBs.

161
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,180
Wow, geez!

162
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,150
It's a shame.

163
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,130
The two-seaters over there have a better view.

164
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,750
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,420
I didn't realize this was originally a dinner for you two.

166
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,370
It's fine.

167
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,820
This unexpected atmosphere isn't bad either.

168
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,560
Oh yeah, I'm reading your novel.

169
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,720
Really?

170
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,270
Yes, it's really fun.

171
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,460
What do you think of the male protagonist?

172
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,530
I made him as similar to Min Joon Oppa as possible.

173
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,400
He's cool.

174
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,320
Right?

175
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,070
I chose the right model.

176
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,570
But I had writer's block, so I was going to interview him,

177
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,050
but Min Joon Oppa just won't spare me his time.

178
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,750
Seul Bi, would you like to have an indirect interview with me?

179
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,280
Which room is yours?

180
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,210
Well...

181
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,320
My room is a very special place.

182
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,420
There's a place like that within Geumhwa Hotel?

183
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,610
- Which floor is it? 
 - Jang Gyeong.

184
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,570
I should read your novel, too.

185
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,270
My room is past somewhere that's

186
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,060
noisy like a steam locomotive and smells like metal,

187
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,700
and down along a creepy and silent hallway—

188
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,110
Seul Bi.

189
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,180
What's this?

190
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,990
I'm really curious.

191
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,330
I want to go.

192
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,140
Then would you like to come over?

193
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,060
- Yes. 
 - You can't!

194
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,990
It's Seul Bi's room,

195
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,720
but I have to get your permission?

196
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,240
Seul Bi was just joking.

197
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,860
How could a place like that exist?

198
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,290
You're done eating, right?

199
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,870
Let's get going.

200
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,300
I'm not done yet!

201
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,280
Honestly, what's with him?

202
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,360
You met with Jang Gyeong

203
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,160
and brought that child with you?

204
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,330
Yes.

205
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,510
What on earth are you thinking?

206
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,280
Jang Gyeong is also aware of Seul Bi, Father.

207
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,340
It's not something to get that upset about.

208
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,820
Jang Gyeong is aware of Seul Bi?

209
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,950
How did you explain her to Jang Gyeong?

210
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
That we hid her in the house?

211
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,280
That she's the woman I like.

212
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,240
You bastard.

213
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,140
You're out to ruin all of us.

214
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,030
Nothing was right in the first place.

215
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,160
Let's go, Seul Bi.

216
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,700
Min Joon,

217
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,790
I have something to discuss with Seul Bi alone.

218
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,040
Can you leave us?

219
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,390
Yes.

220
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,620
That child,

221
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,480
Su Gwang...

222
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,630
Can you let me meet him once?

223
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,740
Su Gwang

224
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,530
and I broke up.

225
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,200
No.

226
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,580
You two are connected.

227
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,320
You've been strongly connected since a long time ago.

228
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,870
Just leave it. I'll clean it later.

229
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,010
It's okay. Geez.

230
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,480
Wait.

231
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,880
Why is Mi Su's photo here?

232
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,360
What?

233
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,280
Oh, this?

234
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,890
This was a photo of me when I was younger,

235
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,820
but I can't remember who the woman in this photo is.

236
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,020
Su Gwang.

237
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,010
Gong Su Gwang.

238
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,260
He...

239
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,690
He was Su Gwang?

240
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,530
This is Seul Bi's mom!

241
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,050
What?

242
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,960
But why is she in this photo with me?

243
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,330
She knows me?

244
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,960
 Who are you?

245
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,300
 Su Gwang! Where are you going this early in the morning?

246
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
At that time

247
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,160
when Mi Su and I ran away from Seon Ju Cheol's house,

248
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,070
we were taken care of at your house.

249
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,230
A long time ago?

250
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,150
When?

251
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,450
 Thank you.

252
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,740
 We're indebted to you.

253
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,750
 It's fine. Please eat comfortably.

254
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,410
 What's your name?

255
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,320
 Su Gwang. Gong Su Gwang.

256
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,610
 Oh my, Su Gwang, what are you doing?

257
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,950
 I'm greeting the baby.

258
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,610
 Baby?

259
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,400
 Yeah, she's pretty.

260
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,010
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

261
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,460
♫  I knew it was you  ♫

262
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:28,720
♫  You must have known when you saw my trembling eyes  ♫

263
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,950
♫  Please notice me  ♫

264
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,590
♫  I'll smile a little more  ♫

265
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,950
 Nice to meet you, baby.

266
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,390
 Honey.

267
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,040
 What are you doing, Su Gwang?

268
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,220
♫  Please notice my feelings for you  ♫

269
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,630
 Thank you so much.

270
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,010
 Please take good care of her, Su Gwang.

271
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,590
So I met Su Gwang before.

272
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,230
As well as Su Gwang's mom.

273
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,270
♫  we will never be together again  ♫

274
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,190
♫  we will never be together again  ♫

275
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:28,590
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

276
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,430
I left without even being able to say goodbye to your mom.

277
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,410
I was foolishly deceived by Seon Ju Cheol

278
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,170
and brought Mi Su back to that bastard.

279
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,170
 How long do you think you'll be able to stay hidden?

280
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,630
 I know that you're an ambitious man.

281
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,420
 Tell me what you want,

282
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,000
 whatever it may be.

283
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,950
 All right.

284
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,900
 Send Go Sang Cheol.

285
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,710
 Yes, Chairman.

286
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,340
 Mi Su we need to leave.

287
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,820
 You.

288
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,100
 Why are you here?

289
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,540
 Where's the chairman?

290
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,460
 You should know very well why Chairman Seon sent me.

291
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,120
 Seon Ju Cheol

292
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,050
 deceived me.

293
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,880
 Hurry and go!

294
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,490
 Catch him!

295
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,040
 No!

296
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,140
 Let go!

297
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,700
 Let me go, you bastards!

298
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,540
 Let me go!

299
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,400
 Let me go!

300
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,350
 Let go.

301
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,640
I was blinded by money,

302
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,970
and the woman who only trusted me.

303
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,980
Seon Ju Cheol only took Mi Su and framed me.

304
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,500
It wasn't just one or two charges.

305
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,560
They said that I embezzled company money and that I killed someone.

306
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,040
Even so, I'm still alive and well.

307
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,110
Your father, Mr. Go, almost killed me, too.

308
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,940
My father?

309
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,450
Huh?

310
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,830
It's nothing. It's nothing.

311
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,610
I... I'm just saying gibberish.

312
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,800
I-I'm going to get some air.

313
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,220
♫  On a sunny day  ♫

314
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,690
 You're the most precious to me.

315
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:20,430
♫  With the warm light, suddenly  ♫

316
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:34,000
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

317
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,460
The breeze feels much cooler.

318
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:44,440
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

319
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,140
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

320
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,140
Seul Bi,

321
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,740
do you remember what I said last time?

322
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,720
That I should become your boyfriend.

323
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:32,130
♫  Because I know I can’t let go easily  ♫

324
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,370
♫  I guess I’ve been waiting for you all day  ♫

325
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,740
Don't do this.

326
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,740
Don't do this, Min Joon.

327
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,200
Sorry.

328
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,630
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,190
♫  I’ve never hated the wind that blew on me  ♫

330
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,590
If you don't like it, I'll never do it again.

331
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,320
♫  I’ve never hated the wind that blew on me  ♫

332
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:58,400
♫  Why do you bring back memories of you and shake me?  ♫

333
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:07,790
♫  I want to tell you not to come back  ♫

334
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:21,800
♫  I’m afraid you’ll disappear without saying a thing  ♫

335
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,180
 Who is that?

336
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,790
 Is that important?

337
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,160
 Hey, I should at least know whom I'm killing.

338
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,670
 - Chairman. 
 - Gong Su Gwang.

339
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,910
 He got into Geumhwa Group with the highest score.

340
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,330
 All right.

341
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,780
 You must take care of this properly.

342
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,670
 Yes, I understand.

343
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,010
Sh*t, this isn't it either.

344
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,680
Geez!

345
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,340
Hey!

346
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,390
None of this is it!

347
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,160
None of are it!

348
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,070
Hey. You gave them to me without even checking them?

349
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,400
The video that CEO Choi talked about.

350
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,910
Find the video that CEO Choi recorded.

351
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,140
No matter how I think about it,

352
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,500
I think CEO Choi took it and is in hiding.

353
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,940
Then you should find CEO Choi and bring him to me!

354
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,430
Don't stand here like an idiot!

355
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,140
I took this bastard, who was extorting money from the street vendors,

356
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,110
and made him into somebody.

357
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,970
This a**hole

358
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,170
dares to bite his owner?

359
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,630
Two years ago, the hitman who tried to kill me

360
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,740
was you?

361
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,190
Did you hear that from Assistant Jeong?

362
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,070
Then why

363
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,350
didn't you kill me and saved me instead?

364
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,450
I heard a prophecy.

365
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,260
 Your son will die tonight.

366
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,190
 What are you saying?

367
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,600
 Why would my son die?

368
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,290
 If I save your son,

369
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,680
 you must also do me a favor.

370
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,250
 Go home immediately.

371
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,120
 Your house will be brimming with gas.

372
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,290
 Stop him from turning on the lighter.

373
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,910
 Then your son will be able to live until he becomes an adult.

374
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,680
Thanks to that female shaman, I saved my son, who could've died that night.

375
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,460
That female shaman asked me a favor in return.

376
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,140
 Twenty years later,

377
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,220
 you'll have to kill a certain child.

378
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,020
 You must save him.

379
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,580
 Promise me.

380
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,140
For 20 years, I was reminded every night

381
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,420
of that female shaman's earnest request.

382
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,500
And after 20 years, I received a request.

383
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,900
To kill you.

384
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,480
Su Gwang,

385
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:13,080
what saved you was that female shaman's desperate plea.

386
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,710
What should I do?

387
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,940
What on earth should I do?

388
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,420
Do you know?

389
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,210
This is the first time you have asked me for my opinion.

390
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,330
You always only wanted to know about the future I see.

391
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,330
During the past years, I always

392
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,670
wanted to know

393
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,150
what you wanted and what you held dear in your heart.

394
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,990
Now you ask me for my opinion.

395
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,420
If I tell you what I think,

396
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,500
will you do as I say?

397
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,980
I will.

398
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,630
Call for

399
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,770
Su Gwang.

400
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,850
Bring that child here.

401
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,210
Are you talking about Gong Su Gwang?

402
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,450
 Gong Su Gwang

403
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,240
Chairman.

404
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,990
 Who is that?

405
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,270
 Is that important?

406
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,250
 I should at least know whom I'm killing.

407
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,260
 Gong Su Gwang.

408
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,140
 He got into Geumhwa Group with the highest score.

409
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,170
 You must take care of this properly.

410
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,050
 Yes, I understand.

411
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,350
This is the truth behind the incident from two years ago.

412
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,240
You already knew, didn't you?

413
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,860
Why did you ask to meet me instead of going to the police or prosecutor?

414
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,530
All premeditated crimes have a motive.

415
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,980
If you keep digging for the motive of this incident,

416
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,750
Seul Bi is at the other end.

417
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,870
You discarded me,

418
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,930
and Chairman Seon Il Joong tried to kill me.

419
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,050
And instead of me, my mom...

420
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,020
Even if I didn't plan this incident,

421
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,480
I'm still the cause of it.

422
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,900
And it's a crime that my family committed.

423
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,300
I'll apologize however you want me to.

424
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,340
If I tell someone about this,

425
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,300
you'll be punished for only a few years—

426
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,070
No, not even that much time, by using your authority.

427
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,410
And innocent Seul Bi

428
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:49,740
will be hurt by people's judgment and rumors.

429
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,690
Then what is it that you want?

430
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,880
I want exactly two things.

431
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,670
For Chairman Seon Il Jung to pay for what he's done

432
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,120
and...

433
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,160
for you people to let go of Seul Bi and her mom.

434
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,090
The first one is something I can cooperate with.

435
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,040
But the second one...

436
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,070
I'm not the one holding on to Seul Bi.

437
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,990
What does that mean?

438
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,240
Seul Bi is

439
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,760
staying there willingly.

440
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,010
 Call for Su Gwang.

441
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,680
Good job.

442
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,650
- Good work. 
 - Good job.

443
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,880
Chief Director and directors.

444
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,990
This is Gong Su Gwang, who is newly hired as the chairman's secretary.

445
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm Gong Su Gwang.

446
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,690
I look forward to working with you.

447
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,620
Sure, nice to meet you.

448
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,780
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

449
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,150
What is the meaning of this?

450
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,850
Min Joon, you see...

451
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,620
You're here.

452
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,470
Yes, Chairman.

453
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,050
Hold on!

454
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,040
Hold on.

455
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,540
I want to talk to Su Gwang for a second.

456
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,570
Let's talk later, Seul Bi.

457
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,000
Secretary Gong,

458
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,360
call her Miss Seul Bi in front of the other staff from now on.

459
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,650
All right.

460
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,390
Miss Seul Bi.

461
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:33,310
From now on, Secretary Gong will be responsible for Ms. Mi Su and your residence, Miss Seul Bi.

462
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,570
Let's go and greet the other staff.

463
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,930
What are you doing, Father?

464
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,140
I'm undoing what happened two years ago.

465
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,110
He had already gotten into the company at the top back then,

466
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,440
so there's no problem in appointing him as a secretary.

467
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,090
Will doing this turn things back to two years ago?

468
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,080
Will everything that happened over the past two years become redundant?

469
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,600
Send Su Gwang back.

470
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,710
You threw a fit when I kicked Su Gwang out back then. Yet you're acting this way

471
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,610
because of Seul Bi?

472
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,460
I'll kick Su Gwang out.

473
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,330
Secretary Gong is my assistant whom I chose personally.

474
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,800
You can't fire him recklessly.

475
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,320
Why on earth are you doing this?

476
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,520
Are you in a position to question me over this?

477
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,620
The company is swaying in the wind,

478
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,070
and you're complaining over appointing an assistant?

479
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,930
Do not discuss matters regarding

480
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,100
Secretary Gong from now on.

481
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,620
Seul Bi lives in a place like this?

482
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,960
What's at the end of this hallway?

483
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,350
A rabbit hole?

484
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,770
Exactly how long have you been hiding this matter?

485
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,900
I just can't understand this.

486
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,220
This place is far more complicated

487
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,350
than what you know to be true.

488
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,750
You're Su Gwang.

489
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,390
When I saw you a long time ago,

490
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,310
you were just a little boy.

491
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,070
 Who are you?

492
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,950
 Su Gwang! Where are you going this early in the morning—

493
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,300
 Oh my.

494
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,070
You grew up very well.

495
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,310
Your mother would have been proud of you.

496
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,480
I owe your mother

497
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,510
a great debt of gratitude.

498
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,100
I also

499
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,910
thank you

500
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,370
so much for saving me two years ago.

501
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,290
Don't worry.

502
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,790
I can no longer see the future.

503
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,070
I put

504
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,620
Seul Bi in your care.

505
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,610
Yes.

506
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,770
I

507
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,860
met that person.

508
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,900
You must

509
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,640
meet her.

510
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,090
Now, what do you intend to do?

511
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,520
First,

512
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,080
I'll get rid of that door.

513
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,530
Half and half here.

514
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,990
Nice.

515
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,710
You should join us for a drink. What are you doing all alone?

516
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,100
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

517
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,660
Hey, have a drink.

518
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,860
But I haven't seen Brother-in-law for a few days.

519
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,900
What happened?

520
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,300
Su Gwang won't be coming out to the shop for a while.

521
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,260
- Why not? 
 - Is he sick?

522
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,510
No, no. He's been employed by Geumhwa Group.

523
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,670
What?

524
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,080
Why would someone running a shop get a job at a big company?

525
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,390
Is he closing the shop?

526
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,790
Is a corporation's salary higher?

527
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,830
Su Gwang's shop has been doing well these days, too.

528
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,690
Oh my, is it because our Seul Bi doesn't like a man who runs a fish shop

529
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,970
and ran off to a man from a wealthy family?

530
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,550
No, no. He went to Seul Bi.

531
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,840
What?

532
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,130
What do you mean he went to Seul Bi?

533
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,820
What does Seul Bi have to do with Geumhwa Group?

534
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,510
Oh my! Is Seul Bi the daughter of Geumhwa Group?

535
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,940
No, no! No, that's not it.

536
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,430
Oh my gosh. My gosh!

537
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,350
She's the daughter of Geumhwa Group!

538
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,450
Then what's your relationship with Geumhwa Group?

539
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,700
No, no! I have nothing to do with them!

540
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,170
What do you mean you don't?

541
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,800
Oh my. While he was their driver, he had a one-night stand with their daughter.

542
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,310
That's it!

543
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,160
I need to look this up.

544
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,600
- Yeah. 
 - Wait. If Seul Bi is Geumhwa Group's daughter,

545
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,750
then Brother-in-law went there as the future son-in-law?

546
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,710
No! No! It's not! I said it's nothing like that!

547
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,670
Geez! I'm so annoyed!

548
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,800
Okay, okay.

549
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,110
- Stop getting riled up and sit down. 
 - Sit down.

550
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,080
- Calm down and sit. 
 - Sit down.

551
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,330
Then I guess Brother-in-law and Seul Bi won't come to the market?

552
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,770
What do we do?

553
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,350
The market will be lonesome.

554
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,940
- Seriously. 
 - Hyeon Tae, I'll do better from now on.

555
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,990
Why did you come here?

556
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,430
I brought it in case you wanted to read it.

557
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,030
Wow. There are so many books.

558
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,520
I was always curious about

559
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,470
what kinds of books you read and how you spent your time.

560
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,480
Why did you come here?

561
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,570
I was worried

562
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,880
because you didn't pick up your phone.

563
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,480
That's why you came here?

564
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,690
You didn't come out, so I just came.

565
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,540
I told you that I'll protect you, too.

566
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,250
Go back, Su Gwang.

567
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,290
I

568
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,870
don't have anywhere to go.

569
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,340
I don't remember.

570
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,700
I woke up from an accident

571
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,190
but I can't get in touch with anyone,

572
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,960
and the only thing I remember is you.

573
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,280
That's what I want to say,

574
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,280
but I remember everything.

575
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,820
Everything, without missing a single detail.

576
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,230
That's why I've come.

577
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,910
Because I didn't want to leave my memories of you

578
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,220
as just good memories.

579
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,870
Now,

580
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,770
and in the future, too,

581
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,640
I want to be with you.

582
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,110
It's dangerous for you to be here.

583
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,870
It'll be okay since you're here.

584
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,060
I'm the one who'll put you in danger.

585
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,480
It'll be okay as long as we're together.

586
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,950
Su Gwang.

587
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,470
I'm going to stay here in room 1901 for now.

588
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,070
Call me if you ever need me.

589
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,400
Oh, right.

590
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,540
This.

591
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,980
Mr. Jeong asked me to give this to you.

592
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,450
I'll go now.

593
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:03,940
 The World of Marketing

594
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,860
 -You were adventuring into the world of marketing? 
 - Yeah.

595
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:14,060
 The world where Su Gwang's fish shop makes it big is here.

596
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,310
 I smell something delicious.

597
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,420
Father never gave his heart to my mother.

598
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,550
Even after realizing that it was because of you,

599
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,550
I never resented you for it

600
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,840
because it was all Father's fault.

601
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,070
But now,

602
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,350
I'm getting angry.

603
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,150
Why are you doing this to me?

604
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,080
Can't you trust me?

605
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Do you think I'll lock up Seul Bi and marry another woman as Father did?

606
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,640
Min Joon,

607
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,480
you

608
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,890
can't become Seul Bi's lover.

609
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,300
Ms. Mi Su, you can't see the future anymore,

610
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,620
so don't be presumptuous.

611
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,220
I'll never give up on Seul Bi.

612
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,280
Gong Su Gwang.

613
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,620
What are you going to do in here?

614
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,310
Are you going to keep an eye on me

615
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,540
and see what I do to Seul Bi?

616
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,040
Min Joon, I have nothing

617
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,050
except for Seul Bi.

618
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,140
That's why I had no other choice but to come here.

619
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,950
No.

620
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,470
You came here to drive me crazy.

621
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,560
"Look here."

622
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,570
"See what your father did."

623
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,930
"Take a good look at what you're doing."

624
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,090
To make me see with my own two eyes.

625
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,020
The reason you're miserable when you look at me isn't because of me.

626
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,560
It's because of your guilt.

627
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,960
Su Gwang,

628
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,790
I told you

629
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,700
that I'll do everything you want and everything you tell me to do.

630
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,820
But Seul Bi is the only exception.

631
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,360
You don't have to do anything for me, Min Joon.

632
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,920
And there's no reason for you to feel guilty.

633
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,080
It's like I said.

634
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,040
The incident from two years ago...

635
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,390
You don't need to be hard on yourself.

636
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,540
What did you talk about with Father?

637
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,790
Is that a secret, too?

638
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,660
You're drunk.

639
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,380
Stop drinking.

640
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,600
It's the first time you asked me to come first.

641
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,940
There's something

642
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,920
I must tell you.

643
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,190
Do you still think

644
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:29,240
that Seul Bi is that man's daughter?

645
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,510
Huh?

646
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,890
Seul Bi

647
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,270
is your daughter.

648
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,490
If there's nothing between you and Assistant Jeong,

649
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,430
then why would he

650
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,340
have run away with you back then?

651
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,340
I wanted to leave no matter what it took back then,

652
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,770
so I deceived him.

653
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm sorry.

654
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,750
What is it that you want to do?

655
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,330
I'm talking about what you desire.

656
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,170
Why are you curious about that after all this time?

657
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,320
Think about it.

658
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,430
Why did you bring Su Gwang?

659
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,230
Aren't you going to answer me?

660
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,940
I said, why did you bring in Su Gwang?

661
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:49,520
You probably heard from your mom

662
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,980
that if misfortune accumulates within you—

663
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,760
That I'll become a witch and put a curse on someone close to me?

664
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,430
So what? You think that I'll...

665
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,060
put a curse on Min Joon or something?

666
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,740
Preventing you

667
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,040
from becoming miserable

668
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,330
is

669
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,470
what your mom wants.

670
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,280
Since when did you listen to what Mom wants?

671
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,830
Since when were you curious about what I want?

672
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,570
Gong Su Gwang. Gong Su Gwang.

673
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,660
 You're certain it's Gong Su Gwang?

674
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,530
Yes, I'm certain.

675
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,140
 Geez! All right, hang up.

676
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,380
Okay.

677
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,770
Seriously, daebak (awesome).

678
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,350
Wow, I got sucker punched.

679
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:12,410
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing making me feel restless?

680
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:16,410
Father, Su Gwang apparently got a job as Uncle's secretary.

681
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,600
Gong Su Gwang did?

682
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,060
I made such a great offer, and he wouldn't come to work for me.

683
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,520
I got sucker punched.

684
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,150
What the hell do you do anyway?

685
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,590
You boasted that you were going to bring him in,

686
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,130
but you lost the female shaman and that punk, too.

687
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,430
I didn't lose the female shaman, Father.

688
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,860
She said she'll come to tell the fortune.

689
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,460
Did you do that?

690
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,640
I did that!

691
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,410
Whoever did it, she just needs to tell the fortune!

692
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,680
I told you it's not like that!

693
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,370
The good fortune that she brings will all go to that punk!

694
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:49,600
That's why two years ago, I should've just—

695
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,460
Two years ago?

696
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,840
Get out.

697
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,800
- I said, get out! 
 - I'm leaving!

698
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,490
Geez!

699
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,460
I should've killed him two years ago.

700
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,190
Did you find out where CEO Choi is?

701
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,170
Not yet.

702
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,390
Hurry up and find him!

703
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,190
I did as Secretary Gong suggested, and it's not bad.

704
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:45,170
Get rid of this desk, too.

705
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,850
It'll be nice to put a dining table here for the family.

706
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,070
Yes, Chairman.

707
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,130
You have a major shareholders' meeting in the morning

708
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,650
and an appointment with the Baeksan General Hospital director in the afternoon.

709
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,120
Sure.

710
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,110
Are you uncomfortable?

711
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,950
You brought Su Gwang in to make me uncomfortable.

712
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,720
If it's hard on you, don't stay at the hotel

713
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,410
and return to the main house.

714
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,140
Move your office to the headquarters building as well.

715
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,780
No. I have no intention of leaving this place.

716
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,220
From now on, Seul Bi—

717
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,470
Stop talking about Seul Bi.

718
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,720
What are you doing?

719
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,400
- I said I'll take care of things. 
 - What exactly did you take care of?

720
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,190
If Mom finds out about this situation, she'll faint.

721
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,010
Jang Geun.

722
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,480
Seon Min Joon, you—

723
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,370
Oppa!

724
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,430
Hey, don't you think you're too much?

725
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,740
I heard you brought that girl with you when meeting my sister.

726
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,900
Gosh, stop it!

727
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,070
Does my sister look like chopped liver to you?

728
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:07,600
According to Dong Sik, it's been noisy due to equity issues in Geumhwa Group.

729
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,620
Is that why you keep playing around with Jang Gyeong?

730
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,460
Don't disrespect my sister.

731
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,580
Don't look down on our family, you a**hole.

732
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,140
- Let's go, Oppa. 
 - Let go!

733
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,770
- I'm sorry, Oppa. 
 - It's fine.

734
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:42,000
I'm not comprehending this situation right now.

735
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,210
Why are you coming out of there, Seul Bi?

736
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,190
Jang Gyeong.

737
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,690
And what is he doing here?

738
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,340
You don't want to tell me?

739
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:01,070
Then Seul Bi, the two of us should talk.

740
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,260
Jang Gyeong, talk to me.

741
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,090
No.

742
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,100
Seul Bi and I need to talk alone.

743
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,510
Does the Chairman know about the relationship between you and Oppa?

744
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,780
No.

745
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,310
Min Joon and I aren't in the kind of relationship you think we're in.

746
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,750
Fine, let's say that's true.

747
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:41,430
How about Su Gwang Oppa? What is he doing here?

748
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,600
If you can't give up on Seul Bi,

749
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,080
what about Jang Gyeong?

750
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,640
I broke off the engagement with Jang Gyeong.

751
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,710
It doesn't look like that to me.

752
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,210
It doesn't concern you.

753
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,340
Seon Min Joon!

754
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,530
I'll go.

755
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,120
An executive secretary?

756
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,760
Yes.

757
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,350
Seul Bi,

758
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,990
I was aware that Min Joon Oppa likes you,

759
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,340
so I was going to back off.

760
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,800
But you bring in your lover while staying by Min Joon Oppa's side?

761
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,130
It's not like that.

762
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,830
What do you mean that it's not like that?

763
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:25,190
People should have basic respect for each other.

764
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:26,910
If you bring in Su Gwang Oppa here,

765
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,610
how do you think Min Joon Oppa feels?

766
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,440
Jang Gyeong.

767
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,050
What are you doing?

768
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,660
Add hydrangeas to the bouquet.

769
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,110
What?

770
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,990
I knew that you were a little weird,

771
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,160
but what the heck are you talking about in this situation?

772
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,670
I'll take you home.

773
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,590
Let's go, Jang Gyeong.

774
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,040
Let's not

775
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,000
see each other ever again.

776
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:30,510
Jang Gyeong, it's not Seul Bi's fault,

777
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,480
so don't be harsh on her.

778
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,970
They're in love with each other,

779
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:39,600
and you're in love with Seul Bi alone?

780
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,150
So you brought in Seul Bi,

781
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,630
and you brought in Su Gwang Oppa, too.

782
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,160
What are you doing right now?

783
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,790
Since you were young, you were always first in your studies,

784
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:53,660
first in being kind, and first in being handsome.

785
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,410
I couldn't even say I liked you

786
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,570
because you were so out of my league.

787
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,690
Seriously, what are you doing here like an idiot?

788
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,940
What is my protagonist doing here?

789
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,490
Jang Gyeong.

790
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm really upset.

791
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,670
It's time for me to use my weapon, too.

792
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,500
It's okay even if you don't love me.

793
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,040
You need the shares

794
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,000
that our hospital holds.

795
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,110
Marry me, Oppa.

796
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,500
Oppa,

797
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,160
I want to make you mine.

798
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,900
Why did you call me here?

799
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,870
Gong Su Gwang.

800
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,570
Did you really get a job as Uncle's secretary?

801
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:28,200
Yeah.

802
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,660
Then you're working for Min Joon?

803
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,900
I mean, you declined all the good conditions I offered you.

804
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:40,120
Was it so you could wipe the a** of the guy who stole your woman?

805
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,400
Think whatever you want.

806
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,940
But you should know this, too.

807
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:50,000
My father is going to take over Geumhwa Group.

808
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:54,660
Then you will have to work for me.

809
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,160
I'm busy, so I'll leave first.

810
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,780
These people think they can all look down on me.

811
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,890
What is all this?

812
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:25,290
Chairman wanted to turn this place into a space for the family.

813
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,450
Family?

814
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,230
Please have a seat.

815
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,070
Mom, sit down.

816
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,920
Su Gwang, you sit, too.

817
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,700
I'm working right now.

818
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,010
You should still eat dinner. Sit down.

819
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:48,900
Yeah, Su Gwang. Let's eat together.

820
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,540
Sit down.

821
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,440
Min Joon.

822
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,000
Min Joon, you should sit, too.

823
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,240
Let's eat together.

824
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,000
Eat up.

825
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,020
Min Joon, you too.

826
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,950
I heard you two were friends.

827
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:31,870
They were best friends.

828
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,750
Right.

829
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,740
I hope you two become friends again.

830
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:12,020

831
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,150
♫  I'm in love  ♫

832
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:23,620
♫  The road we walk alone together  ♫

833
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,550
♫  For your love  ♫

834
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:32,380
♫  We will never be again  ♫

835
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:38,790
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

836
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,420
♫  Do you feel the same as I do?  ♫

837
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,120
 Jinxed at First

838
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,840
 Seul Bi is being held there because she's trying to get rid of all the misfortune.

839
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,630
 If you want to save Seul Bi, you must take down the castle called Geumhwa completely.

840
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:57,540
 You said you'd never let anyone mess with me again.

841
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,220
 Then you need to know something.

842
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,720
 What the? This is the place they came without me?

843
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,770
 Two years ago, back then...

844
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:08,180
 I hated myself for not being able to do anything for you.

845
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,880
 I'm sorry for saying what I said to you.

846
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,600
 It's not your fault, Seul Bi.

847
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:20,110
♫  I think I know now  ♫
