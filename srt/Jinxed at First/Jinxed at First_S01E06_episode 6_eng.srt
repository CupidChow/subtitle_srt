00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,550
 Episode 6

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,040
 Yoosong Corporation

3
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,310
 Yoosong Corporation

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,700
Is anyone here?

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,710
Fish delivery!

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,070
Is anyone here?

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,960
 Yoosong

8
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,460
No...

9
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,110
What's wrong?

10
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,770
Where are you?

11
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,270
- Get him! 
 - No!

12
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,340
Su Gwang, where are you?

13
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,000
Think.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,700
Where is that?

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,730
 Yoosong Corporation

16
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,430
Yoosong Corporation?

17
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,380
Yoosong Corporation!

18
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,520
Myeong Seong's lady, I made some scallion pancake—

19
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,220
- Yoosong Corporation! 
 - Myeong Seong's lady?

20
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,330
What's with her? As if she has a really urgent matter.

21
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,850
I know.

22
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,350
Did you make this for Myeong Seong?

23
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,700
Myeong Seong! Myeong Seong!

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,710
Myeong Seong isn't here either.

25
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,000
Did Myeong Seong go on a delivery to Yeong Wu's grandma's franchise store?

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,090
Oh! Maybe?

27
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,730
How crazy.

28
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,300
Everyone was so eager to kick Myeong Seong out before.

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,150
Everyone's on Myeong Seong's side now?

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,840
A person shouldn't be like that. So ill-mannered!

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,810
Have you ever fried a pancake for me?

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
Aigoo, Miss Seul Bi!

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,470
What an honor for you to call me directly.

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,650
Miss Seul Bi?

35
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,480
Pi Tae Sik?

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,640
It's been a long time, right?

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,930
Let go. Let go of me!

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,790
You're looking for Go Myeong Seong.

39
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,600
I know where he is.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,060
- Where's Su Gwang? 
 - Su Gwang?

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,630
Oh, that's right. That's what you call Go Myeong Seong.

42
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,420
Come with me if you're curious.

43
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,650
Let go of me before I scream.

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,880
I'll show you something.

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,400
Su Gwang.

46
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,260
Do you want to go quietly to Go Myeong Seong

47
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,350
or would you rather hear that he's dead on the news?

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,580
Hurry up and get in.

49
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,700
Let's go.

50
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,370
 Seon Min Joon

51
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,960
Seul Bi would be happy if she could hear Ms. Mi Su's voice.

52
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,870
Su Gwang!

53
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,740
Su Gwang! Su Gwang!

54
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,660
Su Gwang. Wake up. Su Gwang. Su Gwang!

55
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,730
What have you done to Su Gwang?

56
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,310
He's fine.

57
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,110
He just fainted momentarily after ingesting a sedative.

58
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,240
Why are you doing this?

59
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,740
I'm curious, too.

60
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,380
I thought he would tell me just to bring you,

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,780
but he told me to kidnap this big guy, too.

62
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,610
It was a headache for me, too.

63
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,170
- Why tie him up here? Such a hassle. 
 - Su Gwang.

64
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,530
Oh, you need to be tied as well.

65
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,000
One.

66
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,820
Okay.

67
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,860
I'm done here now,

68
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,460
so I'm off.

69
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,300
What is this?

70
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,070
Is it expensive?

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,100
Thank you!

72
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,660
Hey!

73
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,770
Pi Tae Sik!

74
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,400
You bastard!

75
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,500
Su Gwang.

76
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,290
Su Gwang, get up!

77
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,830
Su Gwang!

78
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,280
Hey! Wake up!

79
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,710
Su Gwang, are you awake?

80
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,210
Where am I?

81
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,250
Seul Bi, what are you doing here?

82
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,510
This is Pi Tae Sik's doing.

83
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,550
Do you think we can untie this?

84
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,760
That bastard!

85
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,970
Hey!

86
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,020
Pi Tae Sik, you bastard!

87
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,880
Hey!

88
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,370
Am I dreaming right now?

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,240
Is that a time bomb?

90
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,490
Bomb?

91
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,020
Placing explosives in a metal container

92
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,410
and detonated by throwing, shooting, or dropping it?

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,790
Reciting an encyclopedia even in this situation. Amazing!

94
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,440
- Then do you also know how to diffuse it? 
 - No.

95
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,570
You should've memorized that, you idiot!

96
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,080
I didn't know I'd encounter a moment where that would be essential!

97
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,200
I don't think it's active right now.

98
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,080
- Let's untie this first. 
 - Yeah!

99
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,860
Try untying it. Hurry!

100
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,610
Hey!

101
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,040
Thank you. Thank you!

102
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,590
Goodbye.

103
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,490
Hey, let's go.

104
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,010
What a beautiful day.

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,700
Seul Bi is in danger.

106
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,060
Min Joon.

107
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,120
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing.

108
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,780
Aigoo, look at them squirm.

109
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,820
They look good together.

110
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,270
Su Gwang, you call yourself a man when you're this helpless?

111
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,810
Try something.

112
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,450
 Lucky Fish Shop

113
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,410
Miss Seul Bi. Myeong Seong.

114
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,710
Did Myeong Seong and Miss Seul Bi go somewhere?

115
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,510
She rushed out earlier.

116
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,780
- She's not back yet? 
 - How long has it been?

117
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,290
It's been over 30 minutes.

118
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,500
No, wait, it's been about an hour.

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,180
 Hello?

120
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,610
Miss Seul Bi, you didn't pick up, so I was worried...

121
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,270
 I found this phone.

122
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,560
What?

123
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,190
Where are you right now?

124
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,350
- The phone. 
 - Oh, are you the owner?

125
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,990
Oh, yes.

126
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,740
Thank you.

127
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,460
Yoosong Corporation?

128
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,580
I've heard that somewhere before.

129
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,070
Yes, Manager Choi, it's me.

130
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,580
Wasn't one of the boss's safehouses Yoosong Corporation?

131
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,480
Does he still use that?

132
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,330
He doesn't?

133
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,650
Okay.

134
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,950
Okay, a female shaman.

135
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,630
Shall we see how you avoid bad luck?

136
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,630
Su Gwang,

137
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,460
the clock is ticking.

138
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,300
Seul Bi! Seul Bi!

139
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,610
I know it's hard, but let's try to untie this!

140
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,490
We have to get out!

141
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,200
Hold on, Seul Bi!

142
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
We have to get out!

143
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,580
If only we had something pointy.

144
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,500
Pointy?

145
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,310
- I have something! 
 - Where?

146
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,500
This, this! I attached this with a clothespin.

147
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,010
Whoa! That's it!

148
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,590
I can untie it with that.

149
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,870
Can you give it to me?

150
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,570
No, my hands are tied!

151
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,330
Lean your body toward me.

152
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,190
Come closer. Closer.

153
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,960
That's right. Just a little more.

154
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,040
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,420
Seul Bi, Seul Bi.

156
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,650
Don't strain yourself.

157
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,100
You'll hurt yourself, so I'll do it.

158
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,640
Be careful not to poke yourself.

159
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,100
Hey! What are you doing? Hurry!

160
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,540
- Hurry, hurry! 
 - Oh, right.

161
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,290
Hold on.

162
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,950
Hey, they're approaching this too ordinarily.

163
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,810
Time is ticking, so you won't be able to escape.

164
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,320
Show your abilities, female shaman.

165
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,330
Su Gwang, hang in there! Hang on!

166
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,700
This mosquito repellent is too bitter.

167
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,940
- You almost got it. Hurry, hurry! 
 - Okay.

168
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,700
One, two, three!

169
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,730
- Hurry, hurry! 
 - Wait!

170
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,740
Su Gwang, good job!

171
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,830
Su Gwang, you're the best.

172
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,050
One more person has arrived.

173
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,990
But he's alone.

174
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,550
Where did he leave his search team?

175
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,600
Seul Bi!

176
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,390
He's a little too early.

177
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,770
Tell the guys to hold him back.

178
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,530
Seul Bi!

179
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,540
Hey, hey! What are you doing in someone else's building?

180
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,930
Who are you people? Where's Seul Bi?

181
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,980
- Hold on. I think I got it.
 - Su Gwang, hurry!

182
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,130
- You got it? 
 - Whoa!

183
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,450
We don't have time!

184
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,200
Seul Bi.

185
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,270
Yeah! Look at Seon Min Joon all desperate.

186
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,750
Seon Min Joon is acting like that over a shaman?

187
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,720
 Yoosong Corporation

188
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,000
I got it! Got it.

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,190
Hold on.

190
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,420
Hurry. Hurry!

191
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,090
- Seul Bi! 
 - Yeah.

192
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,190
Seul Bi, hold on.

193
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,020
Done. Seul Bi, untie me too.

194
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,530
- Okay, okay! 
 - Come on!

195
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,440
Is anybody there?

196
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,470
Open! Let us out!

197
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,490
Ten, nine,

198
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,470
eight...

199
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,480
It's okay, Su Gwang.

200
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,300
What's that?

201
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,190
What is that?

202
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,760
It stopped, Seul Bi.

203
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,270
The bomb stopped!

204
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,720
Seul Bi, we're alive!

205
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,620
Hey! What are you doing? Get in!

206
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,840
Okay! Seul Bi, let's go!

207
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,910
♫  I knew it from the start  ♫

208
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,960
Why isn't this blowing up?

209
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,060
Follow me!

210
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,300
♫  Someone who filled my life  ♫

211
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,360
♫  I live for another day today because of you  ♫

212
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,800
Su Gwang.

213
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,810
Seul Bi, you're awake?

214
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,230
Let's go home.

215
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,450
All right. We'll go home.

216
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,230
Mr. Wang! Go home. To our home.

217
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,180
Miss Seul Bi is awake?

218
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,600
Okay.

219
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,390
It's okay, Seul Bi.

220
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,310
It's okay now.

221
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,100
♫  Even if I get hurt or in pain, I'll love you  ♫

222
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,320
What happened?

223
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,710
It stopped functioning.

224
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,360
Don't tell me that woman stopped it.

225
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,910
How amusing.

226
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,860
I'll take it down.

227
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,080
Hey!

228
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,880
That's right. Be careful.

229
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,160
Miss Seul Bi, are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

230
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,350
I'm not going.

231
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,510
It hurts here.

232
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,780
Blow on it for me.

233
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,380
Hey, look at all that blood.

234
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,400
You really got scratched up. Hold on.

235
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,350
Careful, careful.

236
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,170
Just bear with me.

237
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,600
- Blow on it for me. 
 - Huh? Okay.

238
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,000
Su Gwang, you got hurt, too.

239
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,910
Oh no.

240
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm fine.

241
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,310
Miss Seul Bi, don't worry and just get some rest.

242
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,130
I'll blow on this punk's wounds.

243
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,540
Why is your face so red?

244
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,890
She's burning up. Burning up! Burning.

245
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,560
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

246
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,240
Sure.

247
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,190
Better?

248
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,430
Since that child left,

249
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,450
I keep dreaming.

250
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,230
Are you afraid?

251
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,800
That you might become like him?

252
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,140
Like your father?

253
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,060
Seul Bi is different from me.

254
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,170
She can become an ordinary person.

255
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,070
Relying on a slim chance that might happen,

256
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,100
I wonder what will happen because of what you did.

257
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,990
As expected, you're cowardly.

258
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,400
Cowardly?

259
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,610
If you're so afraid, you should've just killed me then.

260
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:03,400
Is this what I get in return for protecting you and raising that child

261
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,540
- for 20 years? 
 - Protect?

262
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,180
I used my abilities to fulfill your ambition.

263
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,650
You were going to give Seul Bi to your son as a tool!

264
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,970
That child

265
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,410
won't be able to return here anymore.

266
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,160
She has been accumulating all sorts of bad luck in the outside world.

267
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,320
I can't leave her by Min Joon's side.

268
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,490
You must be afraid.

269
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,440
I thought the people looking for Seul Bi would be her family.

270
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,250
What kind of people are chasing her?

271
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,710
We should report this to the police, right?

272
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,820
What if the VIP is part of the police system?

273
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,180
No way.

274
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,140
We can't guarantee that they're not.

275
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,010
If he's someone that our boss is veiling so meticulously,

276
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,630
he must be more powerful than we can imagine.

277
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,500
Also, Miss Seul Bi

278
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,710
isn't exactly ordinary herself.

279
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:28,230
First, I'll catch Pi Tae Sik and find out.

280
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,660
You shouldn't trust even the police.

281
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,530
All right.

282
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,790
I think we'll be able to find her first.

283
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,520
Min Joon, what's wrong?

284
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,150
I got into a fight at the bar.

285
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,060
What on earth are you up to?

286
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,710
Min Joon, let me take a look.

287
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,010
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

288
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,210
I'm fine.

289
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,310
It wasn't a bar fight, was it?

290
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,510
You'd never do that.

291
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,240
I do that sometimes, too.

292
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,600
Fine, which bar was it?

293
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,230
I'll take care of whoever they are.

294
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,650
Can't you just let it be?

295
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,600
If things become too overwhelming for you, be sure to let me know.

296
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,700
 It stopped.

297
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,600
 It's all right, Su Gwang.

298
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,400
Su Gwang, look at this. I successfully fried an egg.

299
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Are you okay? You're not in pain anymore?

300
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,020
Yeah.

301
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,300
Ta-da!

302
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,400
Try it.

303
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,050
Try it.

304
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,600
- It's delicious. 
 - Really?

305
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,520
For real? Sincerely?

306
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,880
Yeah.

307
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,240
I got a compliment.

308
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,840
Seul Bi.

309
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,250
Yeah?

310
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,590
How did the bomb stop in that warehouse yesterday?

311
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,050
I'm not sure.

312
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,000
Maybe it broke.

313
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,170
You were anxious before I left for the delivery.

314
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,600
Did you know that the warehouse would be dangerous?

315
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,870
When you say something,

316
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,570
it becomes reality.

317
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,970
I...

318
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,920
dreamt about it.

319
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,000
My dreams tend to be accurate.

320
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,500
If I have a bad dream, something bad always happens that day.

321
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,300
Can't you tell me now?

322
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,150
Why you ran away,

323
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,790
who you're running from,

324
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,920
and

325
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,900
what kind of person you are.

326
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,980
You say you like me, but why can't you be honest?

327
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,350
Why do you keep lying?

328
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:40,690
How can I like someone who only lies to me?

329
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,900
Sorry.

330
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,570
Where is your necklace?

331
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,930
Pi Tae Sik took my necklace.

332
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,430
Isn't that necklace important to you?

333
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,050
You always wore it everywhere.

334
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,250
It's okay.

335
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,040
The necklace will return to me.

336
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,340
- Seul Bi. 
 - I'm hungry.

337
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,820
Will you keep nagging while I'm eating?

338
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,260
 This gem is a part of you.

339
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,260
 So no one will be able to take this from you.

340
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,650
 What if I lose it?

341
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,060
 If this gem is ever separated from you,

342
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,780
 it will return to you of its own will.

343
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,900
This is a rock.

344
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,340
What? What are you saying?

345
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,200
Take a good look. Isn't it a Blue Diamond or something?

346
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,100
How is this a diamond? It's just a rock.

347
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,620
A rock can be this clear? This color?

348
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,790
It even glows at night!

349
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,240
That's not my concern.

350
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,070
This chain is 18K gold, though.

351
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,980
You can sell that.

352
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,530
Forget it.

353
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,190
Who are you trying to con?

354
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,950
One look and you can tell it's valuable.

355
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,140
Are they all blind?

356
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,830
As expected, a girl mixed up with Gong Myeong Seong is bad luck.

357
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,720
It's such a waste.

358
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,550
I'll just wear it.

359
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,410
So itchy.

360
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,540
So itchy!

361
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,660
What are you doing in front of my store? Huh?

362
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,800
- Whoa! The necklace— 
 - Don't touch me!

363
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,130
Go to a hospital!

364
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,980
No, no!

365
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,220
There.

366
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,120
- I have to go there. 
 - Go where?

367
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,870
Seul Bi is okay.

368
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,830
I'll protect Seul Bi.

369
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,890
Don't do that.

370
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,010
If you bring Seul Bi back,

371
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,900
you'll be in danger.

372
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,800
What's wrong with him?

373
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,330
What kind of zombie movie is that?

374
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,530
Hey, hey! Go to the hospital if it hurts! The hospital!

375
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,740
Don't go near him!

376
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,270
What if it's an infectious disease, like murderous parasites in the movies?

377
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,560
Why isn't Mr. Wang here yet?

378
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,890
- Geez. 
 - Myeong Seong!

379
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,200
Pi Tae Sik has been like that for a while.

380
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,720
Oh my goodness. What's wrong with him?

381
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,640
It itches like crazy! Take this off of me! Off!

382
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,590
Hey!

383
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,030
Don't go near Seul Bi.

384
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,790
Su Gwang.

385
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,710
It's because of the necklace.

386
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,400
Hyeongnim, when did you get here?

387
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,880
I almost died.

388
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,850
Come here, you a**hole.

389
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,620
- Why? 
 - Come on.

390
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,520
See?

391
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,150
It came back to me.

392
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,350
Hyeongnim! Hyeongnim, please forgive me this once.

393
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,090
I know now. I've come to a realization, Hyeong.

394
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,380
- Realize what? 
 - You were right.

395
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,060
That wench...

396
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,650
No. That girl is not ordinary.

397
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,670
I won't do it again. I'll never do it again.

398
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,550
I'll truly reflect!

399
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,650
Who ordered you to kidnap Miss Seul Bi?

400
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,090
I don't know. It must be some rich person.

401
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,140
He gave me a lot of money.

402
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,580
Call him.

403
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,190
Okay, I'll call him, Hyeong.

404
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,900
Let me go.

405
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,370
- Call first. 
 - Sh*t!

406
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,770
 The number you dialed is not in service.

407
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,400
 Please check and dial again.

408
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,000
Do you want to die?

409
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,340
I'm telling the truth!

410
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,350
That's the right number!

411
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,310
Please don't kill me.

412
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,460
I've looked up to you since elementary school, Hyeongnim.

413
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm truly reflecting on my actions.

414
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,000
I'll sincerely apologize to that girl.

415
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,780
This bastard.

416
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,690
If you do something like that once more, it won't end like this.

417
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,510
Okay, okay, okay.

418
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,190
Geez! F**k!

419
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,620
Did he really have to push me?

420
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,300
Gosh!

421
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,720
 Eunsung Capital

422
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,130
This bastard.

423
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,730
Enough.

424
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,230
I'm sorry, Chairman.

425
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,460
If you forgive me just once, I'll never...

426
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,880
You intercept a report meant for me?

427
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,330
You intercept it and cause all this trouble?

428
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,940
So why would you ostracize me all the time?

429
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,340
What do you know about adult affairs?

430
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,450
How come Min Joon knows stuff that I don't?

431
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,990
You little...

432
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,600
Get him out of here.

433
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,500
Chairman, let's just bury him.

434
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,650
Bury? Bury my a**.

435
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,680
Go and treat his injuries!

436
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,740
Thank you, Chairman.

437
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,770
It's because this bastard stuck his nose into it!

438
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,270
How could you call your son a bastard?

439
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,120
Stop acting like a fool and get up!

440
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,990
Even if you act high and mighty around them, do you think it's your authority?

441
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,770
It's all my power and my money!

442
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,100
So where's that girl?

443
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,830
What will you do for me if I tell you?

444
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,270
Father, I'm an only son!

445
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,920
Your one and only son.

446
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,220
I'll ask you one more time.

447
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,230
- Where is she? 
 - The market! The market.

448
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,810
The marketplace in Seodong-gu.

449
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,690
Market?

450
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,500
Oppa, so you're saying that the necklace

451
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,840
attached itself to Pi Tae Sik and went crazy,

452
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,490
and it was fine after it returned to our Seul Bi?

453
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,890
That's what I'm saying.

454
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,300
You would've been shocked if you saw it yourself. It's weird.

455
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,790
I saw it with my own eyes.

456
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,610
It looked like he was possessed.

457
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,990
How scary.

458
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,680
That could happen if you touch possessed objects recklessly.

459
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,210
So you're saying that Seul Bi's necklace is possessed?

460
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,270
If that's not it, then...

461
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,340
Seul Bi probably has shamanistic powers.

462
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,590
She knew that your husband was buying cryptocurrency

463
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,920
and she also fixed Mr. Wang's son's illness, right?

464
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,100
- That's right. 
 - That's true!

465
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,890
So, a possessed woman (shamanistic) is with Myeong Seong?

466
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,610
That type of woman got close to him because he has bad luck.

467
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,460
- Oh no. So scary. 
 - H-Hey. Hey, hey.

468
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,410
Shouldn't we take her to a fortune teller?

469
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,940
Why a fortune teller?

470
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,680
The shaman there is good at suppressing godly powers.

471
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,910
If we leave her, she'll get really sick from shamanistic forces.

472
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,340
She could be in big trouble!

473
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,020
What do we do?

474
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,820
Seul Bi.

475
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,500
Welcome!

476
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,520
- Two cutlassfish, please. 
 - Thank you.

477
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,570
Su Gwang, two cutlassfish.

478
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,760
Seul Bi.

479
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,450
Eonni!

480
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,750
Hey, Brother-in-law.

481
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,250
- Buy a lot. 
 - Okay.

482
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,370
Ah, bye.

483
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,140
She has many bright days ahead of her

484
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,560
and she's full of promise.

485
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,910
She also has a fiancé.

486
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,950
Please see if you can surpress her godly powers.

487
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,710
There's nothing I can't do.

488
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,530
The problem is

489
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,260
this bit. Yes.

490
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,490
We'll gather every little bit we have, so please just check her godly powers.

491
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,040
All right.

492
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,870
Why don't you come in for now?

493
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,680
Bring her in.

494
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,520
Come in.

495
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,040
Who could she be?

496
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,420
H-How! Wh-What brings you to this lowly place?

497
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,380
What's wrong?

498
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,370
God of Heaven and Earth, Jade Emperor Sangjenim, Maitreya Bodhisattva, General Baby...

499
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,750
Oh my, oh my. All gods out there, please look after me.

500
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,390
So can you surpress her powers or not?

501
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,950
I can't, I can't!

502
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,770
Hello.

503
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,610
Why are you doing this to me?

504
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,370
This is the greatest crisis of my life.

505
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,940
Why are you doing this to me?

506
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,670
Take care!

507
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,240
How come a shaman can't perform a suppression ritual?

508
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,910
Then she'll need to receive her god.

509
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,230
She gave me weird vibes from the beginning...

510
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,670
What do we do? What do we do?

511
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,040
What do you mean, what do we do?

512
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,840
He's already moved in with a shaman.

513
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,950
We'll play along when they do their rituals.

514
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,100
Your words are so... oh my gosh.

515
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,460
Who are you calling a shaman?

516
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,560
Well...

517
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,060
Here...

518
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,350
Me?

519
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,520
Me, me.

520
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,160
Why are you here letting them talk about you like that?

521
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,620
So many people are looking for you.

522
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,400
You actually know who they are and why they're looking for you.

523
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,260
You don't have memory loss. You remember who your family is.

524
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,200
But why do you stay here like this? Why?

525
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,980
Go back home now.

526
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,990
You'll go back one day, anyway.

527
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,550
No.

528
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,090
I'm not going.

529
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,600
Stop acting like a child.

530
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,010
- Just stop it now. 
 - I'm not going.

531
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,000
I said I'm not going.

532
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,370
Gong Su Gwang!

533
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,110
Hey, it's really you.

534
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,380
You were really alive!

535
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,120
Seon Dong Sik?

536
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,630
How have you been, man?

537
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,910
Let's go somewhere and talk.

538
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,470
Who is she?

539
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,170
Girlfriend?

540
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,960
Do you want to go in first?

541
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,570
I'll go in after talking to my friend.

542
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,250
Hey, you should've contacted me if you were alive.

543
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,870
I wanted to forget about everything.

544
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,660
Right, I guess...

545
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,830
Your entry into Geumhwa Group got canceled.

546
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,460
I heard your mother passed away in an accident, too.

547
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,570
 Can't you tell me now?

548
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:44,900
 Why you ran away and who you're running from?

549
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,340
 You say you like me, but why can't you be honest?

550
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,440
 Go home now.

551
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,340
 You'll go back one day anyway.

552
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:02,290
♫  Because of precious you, I had a big heart for you  ♫

553
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:12,770
♫  Your embrace is warmer and smaller than I thought  ♫

554
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:24,800
♫  Because I felt bad, I wished it wasn't the end  ♫

555
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,730
Su Gwang.

556
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,120
Just come to our company.

557
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,700
Geumhwa Group might be small, but it's a prosperous financial company.

558
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,650
With your ability, I can get you a good position.

559
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,680
Thanks, but I'll think about it.

560
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,150
What is there to think about?

561
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,600
The top business major from Hankuk University

562
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,800
is running a fish store in a marketplace?

563
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,270
Just come to me.

564
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,210
What do you keep looking at?

565
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,880
It's raining.

566
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,710
It might be leaking at home.

567
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,690
What kind of house do you live in that it leaks?

568
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,220
Hold on.

569
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,010
 Prince

570
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,950
Why isn't she picking up?

571
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,900
She's not even feeling well.

572
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,480
She wouldn't be sitting in the rain, right?

573
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,830
Who is it?

574
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,860
Is it your girlfriend from earlier?

575
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,080
Dong Sik, I'm sorry,

576
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,180
but let's meet again next time.

577
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,460
I need to get home right now.

578
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,650
Sure. Go ahead, Su Gwang.

579
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,600
Seon Min Joon and Gong Su Gwang

580
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,400
are both head over heels for that female shaman.

581
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,240
Seul Bi!

582
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,590
Seul Bi!

583
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,750
Su Gwang, what do we do?

584
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,410
All the books are going to get wet.

585
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,190
Why were you doing that?

586
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,100
You got all wet.

587
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,160
You'll catch a cold like this.

588
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,120
Su Gwang's books

589
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,920
are Su Gwang's dreams.

590
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,340
Su Gwang,

591
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,700
you honestly want to do these things.

592
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,170
That's why

593
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,060
I need to protect them.

594
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,720
No, Seul Bi.

595
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,790
Those aren't important.

596
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,260
Those don't matter to me at all.

597
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,710
What's important to me...

598
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,470
♫  Waking up from a long dream  ♫

599
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,270
is you.

600
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,170
You're the most precious to me.

601
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,000
♫  I let you go  ♫

602
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,940
♫  The wind that returned has brought&nbsp;you back  ♫

603
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:09,500
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve breathlessly held back for so long?  ♫

604
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:19,900
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now  ♫

605
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,520
Even if you leave me after finding your family,

606
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,460
and I'm left alone again,

607
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,470
I'm fine even if I'm the only one who gets hurt.

608
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,850
I love this moment with you right now.

609
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:45,340
♫  I've never hated the wind that blew at me  ♫

610
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,170
I like you.

611
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,600
Sincerely.

612
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,400
♫  Why does it carry memories of you and shake me?  ♫

613
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:03,700
♫  I want to tell you not to come back  ♫

614
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:19,000
♫  I'm afraid you'll disappear from me without saying anything  ♫

615
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:32,700
Seul Bi, let's eat break—

616
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,420
Why do you do that when you read a book? Aren't you dizzy?

617
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,220
Yeah. I'm in the middle of a journey.

618
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,480
In the world inside the book.

619
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,100
What kind of world were you traveling to?

620
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,270
"How to achieve customer value through pricing strategy."

621
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,590
I see.

622
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,640
You were adventuring in the world of marketing?

623
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,750
Yeah.

624
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,160
The world where Su Gwang's fish shop makes it big is in here.

625
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,970
Gosh, I wish that world existed in reality, too.

626
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,760
I'm going to make it a reality.

627
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,700
You and me, together.

628
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:12,750
♫  We will never experience this moment again  ♫

629
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,360
I smell something delicious.

630
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,310
What's for breakfast?

631
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,480
- Steamed egg. 
 - Sounds good!

632
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,400
Market remodeling support and online grocery shopping support.

633
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Choose one. Write it after careful thought.

634
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,640
Hello!

635
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,640
Hi!

636
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,530
- Hello. 
 - You're here.

637
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,810
So pure and cheery.

638
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,970
So pretty, so pretty.

639
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,430
Brother-in-law, did you eat?

640
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,670
Aigoo, she's so pretty. So what if she's a shaman?

641
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,410
Yeah, so what if she's possessed by a spirit?

642
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,960
She's good and bright.

643
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,380
You were making a fuss saying she was possessed just yesterday.

644
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,580
Do you think she can also tell lottery numbers?

645
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,300
- Lottery numbers? 
 - Don't do that!

646
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,040
Myeong Seong's going to hit you.

647
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,120
He was shooting lasers from his eyes because he got mad yesterday.

648
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,310
Didn't you see the lasers just now as well?

649
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,030
It's profitable if he can win the lottery in exchange for one beating.

650
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,930
Miss Seul Bi?

651
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,360
Please excuse us for a moment.

652
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,870
Here, please take this.

653
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,070
Miss Seul Bi, according to your gut, to your vibe,

654
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,920
choose the numbers

655
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,670
and fill them in.

656
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,330
Fill them in?

657
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:35,070
Mrs. Bang, what are you doing?

658
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,650
Just hold on.

659
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,100
Oh! I know what this is.

660
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,280
This is that thing, right?

661
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,140
Choose six numbers, and they give you money if you get them right!

662
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,850
Yes, yes. Now fill them in.

663
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,030
- Mrs. Bang, I can't. 
 - You can't?

664
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,630
- Forever. 
 - Not even once?

665
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,950
No.

666
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,810
Woe is me.

667
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:08,240
Thank goodness. What a relief.

668
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,960
What do you mean it's a relief?

669
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,610
If you win the money,

670
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,500
Eun Su might fall into gambling and disgrace your family with his friends.

671
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,190
How did you know that, Su Gwang?

672
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,600
It's obvious.

673
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,870
I'm the fool for asking you. Such bad luck.

674
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,630
I haven't heard that in a while.

675
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,050
Go away now. You're disrupting our business.

676
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,340
What about me?

677
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,440
- You can't. 
 - Okay.

678
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,550
Go away!

679
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,290
You're disrupting us. Go.

680
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,160
These people.

681
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,050
Don't be like that, Su Gwang.

682
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:39,980
All these people are good to us.

683
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,200
Good, my a**.

684
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,870
Assistant Jeong has been released from prison.

685
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,610
Has it been 20 years?

686
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,910
How shall we proceed?

687
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,410
What can he do now?

688
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,670
I'll put someone on his tail for now.

689
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,600
Sure.

690
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,940
What about the girl?

691
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,340
I'm keeping watch because Eunsung Capital's actions seem a little strange.

692
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,900
I think we'll find where Miss Seul Bi is soon, too.

693
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,060
Find her as soon as possible

694
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,500
so that she doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

695
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,300
Understood, Chairman.

696
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,450
H-Hello?

697
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,620
Yes.

698
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,270
A fish shop?

699
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,340
 One unread message

700
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,750
Lucky Fish Shop? 
  Manager Yeom: Lucky Fish Shop

701
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,590
Our mail is only full of bills.

702
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,620
Mail? Letter?

703
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,440
Is there a letter for me, too?

704
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:12,460
You're waiting for a letter?

705
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,930
No...

706
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,620
I'm not.

707
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,730
There's no reason for me to be.

708
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,760
So what are you doing right now?

709
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,310
A professional chef on TV taught us

710
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,500
how to cook delicious octopus ramen.

711
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,960
Oh yeah?

712
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,200
You're good at drawing and pretty much everything. 
  Octopus Ramen

713
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,740
Right?

714
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,110
I'm done.

715
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,060
 Octopus Ramen

716
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,380
It would look even better laminated.

717
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,620
 Octopus Ramen

718
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,650
Yeong Wu's mom!

719
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,560
Yeong Wu doesn't have an appetite these days.

720
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,160
He would love this.

721
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,650
- Give us an octopus. 
 - Okay.

722
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,270
- Su Gwang! 
 - Okay.

723
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,440
Mollusk, belonging to the Cephalopoda Decapoda family.

724
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,210
One octopus coming right up.

725
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,000
What? The two of them are becoming similar.

726
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,190
When did you memorize that?

727
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,010
It's a secret.

728
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,510
Seul Bi Noona!

729
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,790
Hyeon Su!

730
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,360
Hyeon Su, are your eyes all better now?

731
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,600
He's still being treated, but he's much better so he got discharged.

732
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,250
Outpatient treatment will be enough.

733
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:26,690
This is all thanks to you, Miss Seul Bi.

734
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,260
Congratulations, Hyeon Su.

735
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,100
Hyeon Su, you must be really brave.

736
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,720
Bravely faced all your treatment, right?

737
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,440
Yes. I'm brave like my dad.

738
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,870
No, I'm not.

739
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,580
Okay, Hyeon Su, become a great man like your dad!

740
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,000
Yes!

741
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,690
Seul Bi Noona, thank you.

742
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,900
Pi Tae Sik, what are you doing? Come here.

743
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,210
What are you doing? Go on, go on.

744
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,390
Tae Sik would like to apologize to Miss Seul Bi.

745
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,710
You think an apology will be enough?

746
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,670
- You kidnapped a person— 
 - I'm sorry!

747
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,340
I won't do it again!

748
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,990
If you forgive me this once, I'll treat you as my savior.

749
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,330
I'm really sorry. I won't do it again.

750
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,670
That must hurt.

751
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:24,310
That rock head.

752
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,540
If you don't keep your word,

753
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:34,680
I'll chase you down and put this necklace on you.

754
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,010
I promise!

755
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,820
Please save me! Save me!

756
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,350
I won't do it again.

757
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,040
Ajussi, you're a scaredy cat.

758
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,880
Don't be like him, okay?

759
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,460
- Ajussi? 
 - Y-Yes?

760
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,640
How could you block the front of my store?

761
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,290
- Are you buying kkwabaegi? 
 - No, I'm sorry.

762
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,970
 Meet that girl and try to talk to her.

763
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,180
 Lucky Fish Shop

764
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,400
Welcome!

765
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,130
What would you like?

766
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,910
Octopus Ramen is the most popular today.

767
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,600
No, no. I'm not here to buy fish.

768
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,700
- Are you here for the job? 
 - Pardon?

769
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,400
Su Gwang! Someone's here for the job!

770
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,880
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

771
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,570
Hello, welcome.

772
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,730
You're the first person to inquire after the flyer went up a week ago.

773
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,600
It's really hard to hire someone these days.

774
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,810
You have a class D license, right?

775
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,940
- Yes. 
 - Thank goodness!

776
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,260
Thank goodness, Ajussi.

777
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,140
Ajussi, please come in for now.

778
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,010
- Seul Bi, stay here for a moment. 
 - Okay.

779
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,020
Go in.

780
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:58,770
When you deliver, start from the closest, Bongmun-dong, and go counterclockwise.

781
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:01,100
That'd be most efficient.

782
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,260
Ajussi, are you listening?

783
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,780
Oh, yes.

784
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,500
- Counterclockwise. 
 - Yes, that's right.

785
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,060
- I look forward to working with you. 
 - Yes, yes.

786
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,170
Myeong Seong!

787
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:12,350
Yes?

788
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,110
Excuse me.

789
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:15,670
What is it?

790
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,570
We're doing a survey.

791
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,710
What survey?

792
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:24,630
Excuse me, your name is Seul Bi?

793
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,030
Yes.

794
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,400
How pretty.

795
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,780
Thank you.

796
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,130
How old are you this year?

797
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,510
Well, how old am I this year...

798
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,860
I'm 21.

799
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,980
Twenty one...

800
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,540
Ajussi, please come out for a moment.

801
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,690
He will be working with us from now on

802
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,520
and this is our president.

803
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,470
Your name is...

804
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:55,430
I'm Jeong Hyeon Tae.

805
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,630
Can I call you Mr. Jeong?

806
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,260
Yes, whatever is comfortable for you.

807
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,240
Yes.

808
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,230
President Park is the chairman of the merchant association.

809
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:08,040
So if you have any issues, you can tell him everything.

810
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,870
Yes.

811
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,080
- Hello. 
 - You scared me!

812
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,170
Yes?

813
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,300
This is their new employee.

814
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,620
Oh my. The new employee here?

815
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,680
I'm the owner of the Chicken House across from here.

816
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,670
Yes, hello.

817
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:24,840
He's very gentle.

818
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,340
His face looks very balanced and nice.

819
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,700
What is this?

820
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,790
This rosy atmosphere?

821
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:34,050
We look forward to seeing you.

822
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,110
Let's draw pictures.

823
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,920
Hey, you keep looking into who the VIP is.

824
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,700
Geez, I'm looking into it.

825
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Hyeon Su, let me try to draw.

826
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,590
Let's see.

827
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,000
Yes, Miss Seul Bi?

828
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,510
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

829
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:01,010
Keep an eye on Hyeon Su.

830
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,520
Is he asking me to look for the VIP or babysit?

831
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,220
Ouch! Su Gwang.

832
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,970
My head hurts so much.

833
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,910
Your head hurts? Does it hurt a lot?

834
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,230
- Let's go the hospital. 
 - Where? Where? Where does it hurt?

835
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,840
- Ambulance! Should I call an ambulance? 
 - No!

836
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:25,000
I think I'll be fine if I go home and take a nap.

837
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,340
Still!

838
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,520
Shouldn't you take medication?

839
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,750
- Should I take you home? 
 - No!

840
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,090
You can't leave the store.

841
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,230
Just finish working and take your time.

842
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:41,400
I'm going to go home and sleep, so don't disrupt me. Okay?

843
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,610
I'm going first. Don't worry.

844
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,820
My head hurts.

845
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,760
You two live together?

846
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,400
Yes.

847
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,790
You live together with my daughter—

848
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:00,050
- Pardon? 
 - Nothing, nothing.

849
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,710
How did they...

850
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,410
Is it a cold?

851
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,560
I told you.

852
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,030
 If you want something from people, you need money.

853
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,900
 If you go outside, exchange this for money.

854
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,410
Mr. Wang, where did you get this?

855
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,300
Why?

856
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,080
This should be appraised as an artifact.

857
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,000
Or go to a museum and hold an auction.

858
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,700
- I can't buy this. 
 - What?

859
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,240
This one is just gold, so I'll buy it.

860
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,730
Please give us a lot of money.

861
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,370
Of course.

862
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,430
That cheapskate.

863
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:53,800
Miss Seul Bi, does Myeong Seong not pay you for working at the store?

864
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,490
I even waived his interest.

865
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,020
This punk works Miss Seul Bi for free?

866
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,360
Don't say anything to my Su Gwang.

867
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,810
I won't. I won't.

868
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,220
Miss Seul Bi, what will you do with that money?

869
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,540
Yes, house 14-2.

870
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,600
Yes, you should come quickly. There's a lot of junk here.

871
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,630
Yes, thank you.

872
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:25,800
The district office will pick these up, and the stuff we ordered will be here soon.

873
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,600
- Thank you. 
 - It's nothing.

874
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:33,260
Wow, Myeong Seong will think he's in the wrong house when he sees all this.

875
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,500
It's pretty, right?

876
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,560
Yes. Miss Seul Bi is the best at everything.

877
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,840
I'll help you paint.

878
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,180
It's okay. I'll do this.

879
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,820
Sure.

880
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:52,790
What?

881
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:57,300
Hyeongnim, Kkang Chl discovered something useful, but...

882
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,590
But?

883
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,570
Hey, stop idling and spit it out.

884
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,120
Our boss's female secretary...

885

00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,040
Su Gwang and Seul Bi's house.

Don't go.

915
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,110
What's wrong, Seul Bi?

916
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,270
Don't go, Su Gwang.

 You're pretty when you sleep, so I've been staring for a while.

926
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,790
 Should I go back to sleep then?

927
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,830
 When you find her, take her to Cheongpyeong Villa for now.

928
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,000
 - I'll go meet her. 
 - Will do.

 - Mr. Wang? 
 - Who's the VIP?

930
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,100
 - How should I know? 
 - Then find out.

 I'll give you three days.
