00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,780
 Episode 13

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,840

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,470
Excuse me, you're bodyguards, right?

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,110
You're Seul Bi's bodyguards, right?

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,260
Pardon?

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,400
You know, Seul Bi?

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,620
With the fair skin and pretty face?

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,370
Oh, Chairman's niece?

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,430
Niece?

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,620
Thank you.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,050
Oh, her?

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,260
I think they said she's a distant relative.

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,860
Was it Argentina?

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,590
I heard she was from Brazil.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,350
Brazil?

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,300
Jang Gyeong.

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,500
Oppa.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
What were you talking about?

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,120
I wasn't digging around asking weird questions or anything like that.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,490
Surprise!

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,650
Oppa, you haven't eaten yet, right? You're hungry, right?

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,360
L-Let's go eat.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,320
You know, Seul Bi?

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,560
She's the ultimate mystery.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,010
The market people said Seul Bi is a rich girl from a chaebol family.

26
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,470
But from what I know, she's not your relative.

27
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,390
But then again, the hotel people believe she's your relative.

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,670
I can't stand being curious.

29
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,560
Let's stop talking about Seul Bi.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,940
Then I'll change my question.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,650
What can Seul Bi do for you?

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,550
Does she help you with the company or make you feel at ease?

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,930
Jang Gyeong.

34
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,710
- Work is complicated these days, so— 
 - Fine.

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,930
Then let's talk about your company.

36
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,350
You need me for your company business.

37
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,620
You're busy, so I'll take care of the wedding preparations.

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,370
My mom said she'll set a date to send wedding gifts to your house.

39
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,600
Jang Gyeong.

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,060
I know you like another woman,

41
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,000
and you can't marry me in good conscience.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,980
But isn't it best not to break your partnership with our hospital right now?

43
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,710
So just do as I say,

44
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,320
and you can thank me.

45
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,540
Jang Gyeong, can you control your heart according to your mind?

46
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,280
Of course, I can't control my heart.

47
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,610
If I had acted according to my mind,

48
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,820
things would already be over with you.

49
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,900
But maybe it's because my heart doesn't have a mind,

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,030
it knows it'll be a loss,

51
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,980
but it still keeps charging forward.

52
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,010
So, for now,

53
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,220
I'm just leaving my body to act according to my heart.

54
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,890
It's like that for me, too.

55
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,000
My heart's like that, too.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,370
Oppa, you can't act according to your heart.

57
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,880
You're Geumhwa Group's Seon Min Joon.

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,370
You don't look that busy, Secretary Gong.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,620
Secretary Gong is carrying out his most important job.

60
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,270
Is his most important job to follow around the woman he likes?

61
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,190
No.

62
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,820
It's to serve a capable person.

63
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,340
That capable person is very pretty, right?

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,790
She is capable, but

65
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,780
she also seems to be good at misunderstanding things.

66
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,930
It's a misunderstanding?

67
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,880
Really?

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,160
Well, if that capable person misunderstands as such,

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,230
then Secretary Gong will respect that misunderstanding.

70
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,730
You said it's a misunderstanding. Why respect that?

71
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
Secretary Gong.

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,220
Yes.

73
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,130
What do you think is the virtue of the secretary?

74
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,210
When I watch Secretary Cha,

75
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,150
I noticed he stays by Chairman's side to see if he's doing well,

76
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,620
tells him to meet so-and-so, tells him to exercise,

77
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,810
and checks to see if he has eaten.

78
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,010
He follows him around and nags him.

79
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,730
Then Secretary Gong will also nag Miss Seul Bi a bit.

80
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,620
What is it?

81
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,610
In my opinion,

82
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,940
Miss Seul Bi should

83
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,710
go out with Secretary Gong right this moment.

84
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,490
Really?

85
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,970
Let's go.

86
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,060
♫  What do I do when even the wind is so sweet?  ♫

87
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,800
Wait for me!

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,940
♫  If I could hold your hand  ♫

89
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,930
♫  I believe I could fly anywhere  ♫

90
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,510
♫  It all seems like a lie, fly in the sky  ♫

91
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,180
♫  What do I do when even the wind is so sweet?  ♫

92
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,100
Look at this.

93
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,280
♫  If I could hold your hand  ♫

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,300
Come here.

95
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,650
♫  I believe I could fly anywhere  ♫

96
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,180
- Do I look good? 
 - Yeah.

97
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,840
You look cute.

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,580
What about Ms. Mi Su?

99
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,460
With Chairman earlier...

100
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,930
She went out for a bit.

101
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,490
Seul Bi isn't picking up her phone.

102
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,550
Miss Seul Bi left with Secretary Gong a while ago.

103
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,530
 Seul Bi

104
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,730
Seul Bi.

105
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah?

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,620
Do you want to take Ms. Mi Su

107
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,750
and go somewhere with me where there's no one?

108
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,350
Where's such a place?

109
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,030
In the forest, by the ocean,

110
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,830
or an island without anyone?

111
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,750
I saw it on television once. A man who lives alone in a house

112
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,100
he built himself out of the soil.

113
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,800
Should we build a house made of soil and live in a place like that, too?

114
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,620
Is it because of Min Joon?

115
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,510
You might misunderstand why

116
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,160
I choose to stay by Min Joon's side.

117
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,810
- But— 
 - I know.

118
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,860
If you saw Min Joon's future

119
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,030
and you still choose to stay by his side,

120
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,570
I'm sure there's a good reason for that.

121
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,930
Seul Bi.

122
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,350
Can you tell me what you saw?

123
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,690
Min Joon will inherit the curse

124
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,470
that Chairman Seon Ju Cheol has.

125
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

126
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,830
There's a way to prevent that, right?

127
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,920
There is, right?

128
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,500
Tell me, Seul Bi.

129
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,160
What has to happen to prevent the curse from passing on to Min Joon?

130
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,310
There is

131
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,360
no such way.

132
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,120
Does Min Joon know that, too?

133
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,780
No.

134
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,740
There must be a way.

135
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,520
A way.

136
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,980
This place is still the same,

137
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,520
although we've changed a lot.

138
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,570
When will you tell him?

139
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,340
Give me some time.

140
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,730
I can't tell Min Joon right now.

141
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,970
That child is too anxious.

142
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,200
You must.

143
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,670
Immediately.

144
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,530
If you can't, then I will.

145
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,370
Why must it be right now?

146
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,900
There's something you must know.

147
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,130
Were you waiting for me?

148
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,620
Why did you come back here?

149
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,820
- Min Joon. 
 - You chose me.

150
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,300
That's why you came back.

151
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,640
It's not like that.

152
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,070
It's not?

153
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,740
Yeah.

154
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,530
It's not.

155
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,270
Why in the world do you make me feel so pathetic?

156
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,080
Because of Father?

157
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,340
Are you doing this to me to get revenge on Father?

158
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,590
I just want you to be safe.

159
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,060
Seon Min Joon.

160
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,670
Let's talk alone.

161
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,690
What on earth are you and Father trying to do?

162
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,360
Why did you come here and confuse everyone?

163
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,050
Min Joon.

164
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,430
I had no choice but to come here.

165
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,020
Did Father plead with you to take Seul Bi away from me?

166
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,730
I came here because I wanted to.

167
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,800
Because I wished for Seul Bi to be freer.

168
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,070
You know that Seul Bi can't be free here.

169
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,590
So?

170
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,130
You're going to take Seul Bi away?

171
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,050
You think you're the only one who can set Seul Bi free?

172
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,130
With that fish shop?

173
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,630
You're going to leave Seul Bi in a place where hundreds of people

174
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,690
come and go in a day?

175
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,230
Is that really what's best for Seul Bi?

176
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,670
Wherever it may be,

177
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,500
I'm going to make Seul Bi happy.

178
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,110
Min Joon.

179
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,680
I don't want to argue with you.

180
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,780
Seul Bi also sincerely wishes for you not to suffer.

181
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,380
What do you mean sincerely?

182
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,330
You two.

183
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,970
treat me like an idiot

184
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,390
and expect me to be okay?

185
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,510
Min Joon.

186
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,110
Everything would've worked out if you hadn't come here.

187
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,480
Then Seul Bi would've gradually forgotten you,

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,750
and if you hadn't come here,

189
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,960
everything would've gone back to normal.

190
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,400
Min Joon, I

191
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,950
really resented you and Chairman

192
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,430
for two years.

193
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,040
I was never going to see you again.

194
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,750
But meeting you again after two years,

195
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,880
you were still the same friend, Seon Min Joon.

196
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,990
The same Seon Min Joon whom our friends considered a softie.

197
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,240
My kind friend.

198
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,390
My feelings for Seul Bi are sincere,

199
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,580
but I also don't want to lose my friend Seon Min Joon.

200
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,850
I can't give up Seul Bi

201
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,150
no matter the consequences I have to pay.

202
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,510
Even if I have to throw away everything I own,

203
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,220
I can't give up Seul Bi.

204
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
I feel the same way, Min Joon.

205
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,210
Where are these bastards?

206
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,530
There he is!

207
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,060
What are you going to do about my investment money?

208
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,400
- Give it back, you conman! 
 - Who are all you people?

209
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,730
How did you get in here?

210
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,730
Who are we? We got ripped off by you guys and can't get our money back!

211
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,350
Sh*t! Let go of me!

212
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,080
What are you going to do about my five billion won?

213
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,920
- Give it back! 
 - Sh*t!

214
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,220
Take that up with the bank!

215
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,720
The bank? You guys already siphoned all that money!

216
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,190
- He's gone nuts! 
 - Get out! I said get out!

217
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,070
- He's crazy! 
 - Get the f*ck out!

218
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,970
Take whatever you can with you!

219
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,480
You prepare yourself!

220
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,700
Get out! Take everything and get out!

221
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,290
Get the f*ck out of here, you a**holes!

222
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,650
Get out!

223
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,840
Take everything and go!

224
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,600
 It's not me. There's someone else's fortune you must tell.

225
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,250
 I'll arrange a meeting with someone special for you soon.

226
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,370
 Make sure you come then.

227
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,990
 Let me go, Ok Jin.

228
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,140
 Please let me go.

229
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,510
 Ok Jin?

230
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,510
 Who's Ok Jin?

231
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,710
 Your descendant will come.

232
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,670
 The curse that you've been trapped in all your life...

233
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,110
 That person will take it.

234
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
His descendant will come

235
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,030
and take his curse?

236
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,920
His descendant

237
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,120
will take his curse.

238
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,590
Seul Bi.

239
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,200
Seul Bi.

240
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,780
Aigoo, aigoo. Our Jeong hyeongnim.

241
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,670
He lives every day in a drunken state.

242
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,270
It's time to close the shop,

243
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,730
but we can't even clean up.

244
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,240
I'm going to quit being a dad of 20 years now.

245
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,250
Quit being a dad?

246
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,530
In a chaebol's family, do they accept a letter of resignation from a dad?

247
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,780
Oppa, you call that a joke?

248
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,800
Gosh, you always pick on me.

249
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,250
Seul Bi.

250
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,730
Gosh, your daughter of 20 years went to a rich family and is doing well,

251
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,390
so you should take care of yourself, too. Okay?

252
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,680
Yeah, something good is bound to happen soon.

253
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,100
Oh my! Hyeon Tae!

254
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,380
He's very drunk.

255
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,980
Eun Su, come help me take Ajussi home.

256
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,800
Huh? I don't want to.

257
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,680
Then let him sleep here? We should take him home.

258
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,890
Why should we take that ajussi home?

259
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,890
He doesn't even live in our rooftop room.

260
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,800
That little brat. Come here!

261
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,260
Hyeon Tae.

262
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,670
Mom, this ajussi keeps acting weak and leaning on you.

263
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,320
Mom, don't fall for it.

264
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,010
Hey! I bent over backward, raising you two,

265
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,600
and now I finally want to date someone. Is that such a problem for you?

266
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,020
Go on and take him home!

267
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,920
Eun Su, come here!

268
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,190
Come on!

269
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,050
Be quiet!

270
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,550
Eun Joong, grab his left. Eun Su, his right.

271
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,980
Ajussi.

272
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,140
- Get up.
 - Friendly and respectfully!

273
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,900
Move it! Move!

274
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,710
Why did he drink so much? Gosh.

275
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,660
- Take him home.
 - Go!

276
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,710
What are you looking at?

277
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,200
Why is she so mad?

278
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,710
 Application to Register Family Relations 
 (TN: Obtaining court permission to register a family member for the first time)

279
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,340
S-Seul...

280
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,630
Is Seul Bi...

281
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,030
She's my daughter.

282
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,400
Not now, Hyeong.

283
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,210
To register this to the court,

284
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,540
we'd have to explain why Seul Bi didn't have a resident registration until now,

285
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,350
and how she was raised in what kind of environment.

286
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,460
We'd have to explain everything to the court!

287
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,830
Do you think the press is just going to sit back?

288
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,100
What about everyone else?

289
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,550
You think you can handle all this?

290
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
But at this rate, Min Joon will—

291
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,380
Then at least,

292
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,690
wait until after the upcoming shareholders' meeting. Do it after that.

293
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:10,360
Until then, I'll hold on to these documents.

294
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,800
Min Joon.

295
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,770
Min Joon.

296
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,340
 Application to Register Family Relations

297
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,270
Min Joon.

298
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,300
You said she wasn't.

299
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,660
You said Seul Bi wasn't my little sister!

300
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,900
Let me...

301
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,500
Let me explain.

302
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,080
Explain what?

303
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,790
What more explanation is needed?

304
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,330
Min Joon.

305
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,510
You said he wasn't.

306
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,760
For 20 years,

307
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,330
you said he wasn't.

308
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,450
Seul Bi.

309
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,550
When I was younger, I used to think

310
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,330
that Chairman might be my dad.

311
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,020
But you said he wasn't.

312
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,130
That there's no way he could be.

313
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,810
So I just erased that thought.

314
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,560
But the one who locked us up

315
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,200
and the person whom I vehemently hated is

316
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,220
my dad?

317
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,590
What about Min Joon?

318
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,500
Seul Bi.

319
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,610
That was the reason why.

320
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,680
That's why.

321
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,970
When I first saw you, you were like a glass marble.

322
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,050
You were so precious, and it was the first time I wanted to protect someone so desperately.

323
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,480
When I held your hand,

324
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,310
I was so scared that I might hurt your hand.

325
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,520
When I learned that you were staying at Su Gwang's house,

326
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,570
I knew that I shouldn't be like that toward Su Gwang.

327
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,930
But you have no idea how petty I was and how much I envied him.

328
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,840
Even knowing that you liked Su Gwang,

329
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,490
I couldn't stop my feelings for you.

330
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,970
I loved you that much.

331
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,070
My feelings were sincere.

332
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,480
I just hope you'd understand that.

333
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,630
To me, you're also a very precious person.

334
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,430
Someone similar to me somehow.

335
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,200
Someone I care for, for no reason.

336
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,880
I wondered if that meant I had feelings for you.

337
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,230
I wondered about my dad for 20 years.

338
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,640
I believed that Dad would be out there somewhere in the world,

339
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,850
but the person who locked my mom and me in this place for 20 years

340
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,790
turned out to be my dad.

341
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,050
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,990
Seul Bi, I'm sorry.

343
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,720
 Someday, there will come a day that Seul Bi and Min Joon also find out.

344
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,620
 I know this is a shameless request to ask of you,

345
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,900
 but when that time comes, please take good care of them, Su Gwang.

346
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:25,770
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

347
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,300
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

348
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,000
That person

349
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,700
is my dad.

350
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,450
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

351
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,940
I always felt sorry for my mom.

352
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,100
But now,

353
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,020
I'm more pitiful.

354
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,650
♫  The wind that returned has brought you back  ♫

355
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:03,060
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

356
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:12,380
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

357
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,010
 There's something that you must know.

358
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,810
 The curse is chunks of bad fortune brought in by humans blinded by desire.

359
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,970
 It doesn't just disappear.

360
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,480
 I'm aware

361
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,750
 that it doesn't disappear

362
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,110
 and that it gets passed on through bloodline, from generation to generation.

363
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,470
 The next one in line

364
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,300
 is probably me.

365
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,670
 You're not.

366
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,050
 You're not the one who is next in line.

367
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,610
 Min Joon is in danger.

368
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,340
 No. No.

369
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,970
 There's no way.

370
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,000
 That must not happen.

371
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,850
 Seul Bi saw the future.

372
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,630
 No!

373
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,730
 Not Min Joon.

374
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,500
 We can prevent it, right?

375
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,640
 There's a way to prevent it, right, Mi Su?

376
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,730
 Mi Su!

377
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,180
 We must end everything.

378
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,390
 Reveal everything

379
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,410
 and change everything back.

380
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,710
 If we don't, Min Joon will...

381
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,960
You trapped me in here for 20 years

382
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,480
and expect it to end this easily?

383
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,160
It won't end like this.

384
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,320
I can't let it end like this.

385
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
My bloodline.

386
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,750
My only bloodline,

387
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,800
the child who will take my curse.

388
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,930
It will come to us.

389
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,910
It will come to us.

390
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:21,740
It will never end.

391
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,320
It will never end.

392
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,790
It will never end.

393
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,080
It will never end.

394
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,460
It will never end.

395
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,430
Father.

396
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,810
Father.

397
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,500
Min Joon.

398
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,030
Are you okay? Huh? Huh?

399
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,030
Do you think I'm okay?

400
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,620
Min Joon.

401
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,840
The wealth that I've accumulated,

402
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,890
fame, this enormous castle...

403
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,030
I planned to give you everything.

404
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,320
Because you're my son.

405
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,540
So?

406
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,500
What's left inside this enormous castle?

407
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,060
Wealth? Fame?

408
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,380
No.

409
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,970
All that's left is your greed and hypocrisy.

410
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,610
That's definitely not it, Min Joon.

411
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,540
 You must do this if you want to save Seul Bi.

412
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,860
 Geumhwa Group is a castle built upon female shamans' powers.

413
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,010
 And there are layers upon layers of misfortune within.

414
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,490
 Seul Bi is being held there to eliminate all that misfortune.

415
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,050
 If you want to save Seul Bi,

416
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,240
 you must completely take down that castle called Geumhwa Group.

417
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,730
Seul Bi said she'll have her meal separately in her room.

418
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,840
I'll tell Min Joon to come.

419
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,530
No.

420
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,960
Please make sure that Min Joon doesn't go out for the time being

421
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,210
and stays at the hotel.

422
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,930
Yes, Chairman.

423
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,980
And cancel everything on my schedule today.

424
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,560
You mean everything?

425
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,730
Yes.

426
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,450
It looks delicious.

427
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,210
Let's eat.

428
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
You like shrimp.

429
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,690
Here.

430
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,100
It looks delicious.

431
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,400
Why did you take my side instead of Il Jung Hyeongnim.

432
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,910
Did you think I would take your side?

433
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,620
Nothing will be enough to express my apologies,

434
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,860
but please let me know what I can do to repay even a fraction of

435
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,110
my wrongdoings up until now.

436
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,840
Since you locked away my niece and grandniece for 20 years,

437
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,920
you must lock away your son for 20 years as well.

438
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,260
Please lock me away instead.

439
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,760
I'll dig a cave and live in it like a mole for the rest of my life,

440
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,550
so please spare Min Joon.

441
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,220
You're not here to sincerely reflect on yourself and apologize.

442
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,960
You just temporarily wore a mask on your face to save your son.

443
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,130
I'll throw everything away.

444
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,190
I'll throw everything I own away.

445
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,750
The wealth and fame that I've accumulated...

446
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,980
I'll throw everything away.

447
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,200
The things you have accumulated?

448
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,530
Geumhwa was a tower built upon female shamans' powers in the first place.

449
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,010
So taking down that tower is also up to the female shamans,

450
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,340
not by your will!

451
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,940
You're right.

452
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,020
So I'll return everything to them.

453
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,170
In return, please just tell me how I can save my son.

454
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,230
I beg of you.

455
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,420
How far are you willing to go

456
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,930
in order to save your son?

457
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,430
I can even give you

458
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,960
my life.

459
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,290
You got all the alias accounts, right?

460
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,630
I took everything out in cash.

461
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,460
What should we do now?

462
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,590
Let's look at the situation,

463
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,720
whether we should make a run for it overseas

464
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,990
or hide in the country and wait it out.

465
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,320
Why did you let Uncle steal her away from you?

466
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,590
What did you say, punk?

467
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,410
If you had just held on to that female shaman back then,

468
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,500
Geumhwa would've become yours,

469
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,610
and I wouldn't have had to get my hair yanked out by those stupid investors, and

470
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,330
sh*t like that wouldn't have happened either.

471
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,760
Hey, you bastard.

472
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,370
Then are you saying that everything's my fault?

473
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,280
Is it not?

474
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,670
You said those female shamans bring good fortune to the first man they hold.

475
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,770
You had said that.

476
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,290
Then two years ago,

477
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,470
before that b*tch Seul Bi held Gong Su Gwang's hand,

478
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,030
you should've made her hold my hand first, by any means necessary!

479
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,520
What the heck were you doing?

480
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,550
Hey.

481
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,140
I was going to find that bastard and—

482
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,830
CEO Choi, that son of a b*tch.

483
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,160
CEO Choi, that son of a b*tch.

484
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,410
Geumhwa was originally...

485
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,410
It was originally mine.

486
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,780
Seon Min Joon can't have it that easily.

487
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,680
What is he saying?

488
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,320
What I can't have

489
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,470
Seon Min Joon can't have either.

490
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,310
That punk, he's—

491
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,980
What's up?

492
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,680
Well, I'm really disappointed.

493
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,870
Your uncle was admitted to the hospital,

494
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,170
but you don't even visit him as his only nephew?

495
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,960
Thanks to his hospitalization,

496
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,070
I heard his prosecution summons was postponed.

497
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,250
Hey.

498
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,820
Are you saying my father is faking it because he doesn't want to meet the prosecution?

499
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,460
 Huh?

500
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,950
 I guess Uncle's hobby is putting people he doesn't like in the freaking hospital, yeah?

501
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,740
 Grandpa to the mental hospital

502
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,830
 and my father to the general hospital.

503
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,700
So what is it that you want to say?

504
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,510
My heart hurts so much because of this tragedy in family quarrels,

505
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,870
so I visited Grandpa.

506
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,210
You can't do this.

507
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,900
- Move. 
 - You can't leave.

508
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,530
Director, you can't do this.

509
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,130
What's going on?

510
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,090
I'm just going to visit Uncle at the hospital.

511
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,600
I should do that much.

512
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,800
Min Joon, Chairman said—

513
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,890
If you can't trust me, call Dong Sik.

514
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,870
You may go.

515
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:58,200
 Dad, I thought Santa would bring you to me, but...

516
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,070
Like you, I also

517
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,840
don't have any memories of my dad.

518
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,620
From my memories, the chairman

519
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,250
caused much suffering for my mom.

520
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,700
He's someone who locked us away.

521
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,560
A monstrous person.

522
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,760
You just need to make good memories from now on.

523
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,450
Until all the bad memories are buried underneath them.

524
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,820
We still have a lot of time left to do that.

525
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,990
 What does

526
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,090
 Grandpa have to say about Seul Bi?

527
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,260
 I don't know what it is,

528
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,720
 but he wouldn't tell me.

529
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,780
 He says he only wants to tell you.

530
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,120
You're here.

531
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,400
You're finally here.

532
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,280
The child who will take my curse.

533
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,380
The child who will take the curse in my place.

534
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,530
Come here.

535
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,210
Come here.

536
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,490
Come on.

537
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,090
Come closer.

538
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,510
Hurry.

539
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,100
Father, I'm Sam Joong.

540
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Sam Joong is here.

541
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,690
For a long time...

542
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,650
For a long time...

543
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,050
Now,

544
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,390
it's time to bring this to an end.

545
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,050
Father.

546
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,820
I'm your bloodline

547
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,950
who will

548
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,070
take away your curse.

549
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,520
My bloodline who will

550
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,990
take away my curse?

551
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,580
Yes.

552
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,480
It's me.

553
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
No.

554
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,450
You're not.

555
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,210
This isn't it.

556
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,290
This isn't—

557
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:38,770
Oh! Father!

558
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,630
- This isn't it. 
 - Father!

559
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,160
- No. 
 - Father!

560
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,590
Father!

561
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,100
Father!

562
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,800
- Sam Joong. 
 - Father!

563
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,530
- Sam Joong. 
 - Yes, it's me! Father!

564
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,250
Father!

565
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,630
It's me, Father!

566
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,180
Grandpa, it's me, Min Joon.

567
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,830
It's my first time seeing you since I was a kid, right?

568
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,720
Grandpa.

569
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,360
Grandpa!

570
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,210
Grandpa.

571
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,880
Chairman!

572
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,220
What happened?

573
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,650
He's been a little strange since he got out of the car.

574
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,670
You can go now.

575
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,910
Did you by any chance...

576
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,880
Yeah, Min Joon. Where are you?

577
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,940
What?

578
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,330
Chairman Seon Ju Cheol?

579
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,530
 Honorary Chairman of Geumhwa Group, Seon Ju Cheol,

580
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,440
 passed away last evening at the age of 94.

581
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,250
 Starting with Geumhwa Construction in 1961, Chairman Seon Ju Cheol

582
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,480
 expanded his business into the distribution and hotel sectors

583
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,680
 and developed Geumhwa Group into one of the top 20 companies in Korea.

584
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,440
Sh*t.

585
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,850
Geez, the police!

586
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,870
How dare those bastards follow me to the funeral and humiliate me!

587
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,140
Geez!

588
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,500
Chairman, you should go to your room if you're tired.

589
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,350
Hey, Do you see or hear any hallucinations?

590
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,760
Why should I?

591
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,720
I mean, you've been exerting yourself for the past few days throughout the funeral.

592
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:58,460
He's perfectly fine.

593
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,060
I thought the curse was supposed to pass on to him or something.

594
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,660
Hey, what are you muttering?

595
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,880
Chairman, please get some rest and feel better.

596
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,890
I'll come and visit you soon.

597
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,470
Oppa.

598
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,770
I'm going to take Jang Gyeong home.

599
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,510
I'll prepare the meal.

600
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,590
You think I'm here to eat?

601
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,170
You said you were going to eat just now.

602
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:33,820
Shut up, punk!

603
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,770
Your elder is speaking.

604
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,950
Sam Joong.

605
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:47,430
You're going to have to cover up this investment fund case for me.

606
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,040
You won't even mix words with me?

607
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,580
This bastard looks down on me until the end.

608
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,430
There's a hidden card in my possession.

609
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,480
You're curious, aren't you?

610
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,890
Sam Joong.

611
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,890
I have to survive in order for you to live, too.

612
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,060
Aren't we still a family?

613
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,130
Is that how you always avoided everything?

614
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,970
What?

615
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,370
Manipulating the weak,

616
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,690
stealing from them, and stepping on them.

617
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,450
And then, if a legal issue arises,

618
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:39,840
you always pushed it on to your younger brother.

619
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,100
You! You're just a newbie!

620
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,230
How dare you run your mouth in front of me—

621
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,440
Chairman Seon Il Jung!

622
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:55,220
You won't be able to squirm your way out of this.

623
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,760
Stop it, Secretary Gong.

624
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,370
You rude son of a b*tch!

625
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,570
Hey, if you

626
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,430
keep messing around like this, you're dead!

627
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,970
Geez, you're just too exhausting, man!

628
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,690
I'm holding back since I'm in mourning. Got it?

629
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,000
If only Father hadn't passed away—

630
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,650
How dare this bastard!

631
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,020
Hey!

632
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,610
Let's go.

633
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,220
Geez, I ought to—

634
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,150
I'm holding back since I'm in mourning.

635
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,530
Uncle, I'll take my leave.

636
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,410
So f*cking humiliating.

637
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:06,570
He didn't say a word throughout the funeral.

638
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,710
Not to anyone.

639
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,250
It seems it was a big shock to him.

640
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,790
I think I should take him to the hospital.

641
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,640
Min Joon.

642
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,360
What is this?

643
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,030
It's a court registration?

644
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,540
A few days ago, Chairman

645
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,150
was determined a grantor of the power of attorney

646
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,170
and gave you the

647
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,980
power of attorney as an agent.

648
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,240
 Family Court of Korea

649
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,440
Why did you do this, Father?

650
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,600
Father.

651
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,560
Are you okay?

652
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,730
Why isn't he saying anything?

653
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,740
Right now, Chairman is...

654
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,080
in the same condition as Chairman Seon Ju Cheol.

655
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,060
What do you mean?

656
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,710
That he's in the same condition as Grandpa?

657
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,770
You've heard about

658
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,830
your grandpa's illness, right?

659
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,350
That it's not a mental illness

660
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:32,930
but that he's under a curse.

661
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,020
I heard about it when I was little.

662
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,350
The bad fortune that accumulated in the female shaman

663
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:42,200
passes on to the one who possesses her.

664
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,200
That curse doesn't disappear but is passed down the bloodline instead.

665
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,700
That curse

666
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,240
passed on to Father?

667
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,560
Why?

668
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,620
Why now of all times?

669
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,740
By any chance,

670
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,060
did he run away?

671
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,370
He got all of us in this pathetic state

672
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,570
and ran away by himself?

673
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,340
He didn't run away.

674
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,730
Father did it for you.

675
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,200
It was your fate to become like this.

676
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,570
Your father took the curse

677
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,280
that was supposed to pass on to you.

678
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,690
He risked his life on your behalf.

679
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,070
 Hey.

680
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:49,380
 Do you see or hear any hallucinations?

681
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,230
Seon Dong Sik.

682
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,850
That's why he told me to meet Grandpa.

683
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,590
Seon Dong Sik.

684
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,110
Father.

685
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,600
Did you think I'd be grateful to you if you did that?

686
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,760
Just how pathetic do you want me to feel?

687
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,030
I'd rather become an idiot

688
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,790
and escape from this terrible place!

689
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,190
Get it together, Father!

690
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,300
Hurry up and come to your senses!

691
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,970
Come to your senses, Father!

692
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:24,860
Stop it, Min Joon. Min Joon.

693
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,840
Min Joon!

694
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,460
I'll talk to him.

695
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,100
How was I so stupid all this time?

696
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,670
Why wasn't I aware of anything?

697
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,400
I didn't know you were my younger sister.

698
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,330
I didn't know Father became like that.

699
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,580
I'm such a worthless person.

700
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,690
Don't blame yourself.

701
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:17,460
I didn't know about it either.

702
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,030
What should I do from now on?

703
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,130
Will I be able to carry the weight of Geumhwa Group?

704
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,450
No.

705
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,430
I can't do it alone without Father.

706
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,760
I want to run away, Seul Bi.

707
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:39,280
Abandoning your father who took your place,

708
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,330
abandoning your job,

709
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,910
and abandoning your friends too?

710
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,150
If you abandon everything and run away,

711
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,710
do you think you'll feel at peace?

712
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,730
I told you.

713
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,890
I envy you.

714
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,990
Your closest friend is by your side,

715
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:02,500
and the father who really loves you is also by your side.

716
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,550
So don't run away.

717
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,700
Go back with Su Gwang.

718
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,470
I'll go back after getting some fresh air.

719
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,200
Min Joon, are you okay?

720
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,400
Yeah. I'm okay.

721
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,700
Eat.

722
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,840
Eat just a little bit.

723
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,100
This is not what I intended.

724
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,170
I didn't realize you'd go this far.

725
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,700
I made you this way.

726
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,610
I did.

727
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,050
Look at me.

728
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,440
Look at me.

729
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,350
Call my name just one more time.

730
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,230
Please.

731
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,500
Just call my name one more time.

732
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,500
That punk Sam Joong

733
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,820
probably won't let me die like this, right?

734
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,510
What's the hidden card in your hand?

735
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,170
A card that can fight back for sure?

736
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,690
Do you even have something like that?

737
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,530
How would I have something like that?

738
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:32,480
Sam Joong wouldn't go as far as to put me in prison,

739
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,260
so I'm just hanging on to his pantlegs.

740
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,080
That's what you do as people sharing a common destiny.

741
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,990
So-called a family.

742
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,070
Family?

743
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,900
Family, my foot.

744
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,030
We're at a complete loss.

745
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,390
It's a complete defeat.

746
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,670
Don't worry!

747
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:53,440
Did you ever see your father going to prison?

748
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,450
If we just play Sam Joong right,

749
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,610
he'll cover it up for us somehow.

750
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,900
Just go to prison.

751
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,620
Just go to prison in style

752
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,730
instead of humiliating yourself by begging.

753
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,670
You bastard, how dare you speak like that to your father—

754
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,200
What in the world do you know how to do?

755
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,260
You always told me I fell behind Min Joon.

756
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,710
You sarcastically asked me what I know how to do.

757
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,860
Out of your lifelong inferiority complex toward Uncle,

758
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,620
all you did was nag at me!

759
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,940
So what have you got for me now?

760
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,630
You...

761
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:42,040
What happened to CEO Choi of Geoseong Private Loans?

762
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,900
I released our guys, and they're looking for him.

763
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,180
So we should hear from them soon.

764
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,290
Bring him back to me alive.

765
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,250
Yes, Director.

766
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,590
You should also stop testing the waters between Father and me.

767
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,780
Make yourself clear and get on the right track.

768
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,700
You wouldn't grab onto a rotting rope, would you?

769
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,910
The weather's so nice, huh?

770
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:16,380
When will you be returning?

771
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,390
I need to look for a container.

772
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:20,540
Let's go together.

773
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,800
Why should I?

774
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,620
Do you think Seon Il Jung won't be able to find you?

775
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,590
I threatened Seon Il Jung for instigating murder.

776
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:30,470
If he gets caught, you're dead, too.

777
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,120
Don't be like that,

778
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,360
and let's rip some money off Il Jung and take off.

779
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:41,000
Let's go to Hawaii and play with some luscious women.

780
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,980
How about it?

781
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,690
You think a threat like that will work on Seon Il Jung?

782
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,760
Don't make things any worse

783
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,050
and lie low for the next few years.

784
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,910
Do you think I'm crazy?

785
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,460
He ditched me like this.

786
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,720
I can't let this go.

787
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:01,050
I need to suck him dry until there's nothing left.

788
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,740
Why are you following me from behind?

789
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,370
I want to watch you walk.

790
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,130
It's nice that I get to continue to see you.

791
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,470
I wanted to see you, too,

792
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,120
throughout the funeral.

793
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,640
So come in front of me.

794
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:56,570
♫  On a sunny day with the warm light, suddenly  ♫

795
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,960
I worried while I chased down Min Joon's car earlier...

796
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:05,780
that you and Min Joon might disappear.

797
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:09,420
I was chasing him but kept getting stuck at red lights.

798
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:15,490
I was going crazy thinking that I might lose you two.

799
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:21,340
♫  I’m reminded of you whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

800
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:28,510
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

801
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,800
Things will get better with time.

802
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:36,560
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

803
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,980
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

804
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,320
I have a favor to ask you, Su Gwang.

805
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,300
Hold my hand just once.

806
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,710
What?

807
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:51,700
I don't know my own future.

808
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,360
I can see other people's futures,

809
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,730
but I can't see my own future.

810
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,320
But if I touch you,

811
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,810
I can see our future.

812
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:08,740
I can see myself in your future.

813
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,560
So...

814
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:16,170
show me my future just once.

815
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,480
- But Seul Bi— 
 - I beg you.

816
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,610
♫  I guess I’ve been waiting for you all day  ♫

817
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:36,910

818
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:48,440
 It's that woman!

819
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:59,750
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

820
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,400
♫  Can't we start our love?  ♫

821
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,690
♫  The only place for my weary heart to rest  ♫

822
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:11,490
♫  It's in your arms  ♫

828
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,950
 Jinxed at First

829
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:38,480
 Mom, the future that I saw...

830
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,660
 Could it be wrong?

831
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,820
 What did you see?

832
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,560
 You're right. I'm a crazy bastard.

833
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,800
 So you can imagine what will happen to you if you reject me, right?

834
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,190
 Everything will be revealed soon, Su Gwang.

835
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:49,260
 It's that woman!

836
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:53,280
 That woman is the female shaman who lived in the hotel's secret space for the past 20 years.

837
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,160
 I'll become naked in front of the whole world and become miserable.

838
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,450
 And you'll leave me.

839
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,220
 That's the future I saw.
