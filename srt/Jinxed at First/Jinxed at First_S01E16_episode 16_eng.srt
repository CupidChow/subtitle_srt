1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Seul Bi!

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,260
 Final Episode

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,950
- Seul Bi! Seul Bi— 
 - Gong Su Gwang, stop right there!

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,110
Or I'll shoot her.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,840
Stop it, Seon Dong Sik.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,160
The police are on their way.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,900
Let's stop now.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,140
It's this witch.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,010
I said, it's this witch!

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,430
This witch is the one who made me like this!

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,180
Nobody made you like that.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,570
You're the one who caused yourself to be like that.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,470
If you stop now, we can still turn everything back.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,640
Stay there.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,550
Stay there!

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,590
Cut the bullsh*t!

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,720
What do you mean turn everything back?

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,550
I'll never get caught.

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,600
Dong Sik.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,140
Let's put that down and talk, okay?

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,590
Dong Sik.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,220
I said, don't come any closer!

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,930
I'm the one who caused you to be this way?

24
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,080
Fine.

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,090
I'm the one who turned you into a monster.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,350
So I'll make sure to stop you.

27
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,030
We're both monsters, Seon Dong Sik.

28
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's disappear together.

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,110
Seul Bi, no.

30
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,170
Stop it, Seul Bi.

31
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,770
Seul Bi. Seul Bi!

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,960
Stop it. Don't!

33
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:12,950

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,130
No.

35
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,240
No, Su Gwang!

36
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,950
Su Gwang! No!

37
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,700
No.

38
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,120
Get us out of here.

39
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,010
All hell broke loose!

40
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,080
Catch them!

41
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,880
Su Gwang.

42
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,900
No.

43
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,850
Please come back.

44
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,870
Please come back!

45
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,630
Come back!

46
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,890
 Come back.

47
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,310
 Su Gwang, please open your eyes.

48
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,770
Come back!

49
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,970

50
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,410
Su Gwang, there's a gun.

51
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,270
Look behind you.

52
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,420
Stop right there!

53
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,070
Su Gwang!

54
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,560
Seul Bi. Seul Bi's up there.

55
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,340
It's going to come to us.

56
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,600
It's going to come to us!

57
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,420
It's going to come to us!

58
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,340
Su Gwang!

59
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,940
- Come here! 
 - What the—

60
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,340
Seul Bi!

61
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,320
Seul Bi!

62
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,420
♫  I felt it from the start  ♫

63
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,980
 No!

64
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,790
 No! Su Gwang.

65
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,750
♫  My heart is already beating  ♫

66
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,340
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

67
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,020
♫  Can't we start our love?  ♫

68
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,250
♫  The only place for my weary heart to rest  ♫

69
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,040
♫  It's in your arms  ♫

70
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,340
♫  The more I love you  ♫

71
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,960
♫  Even if I'll hurt every day  ♫

72
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,590
♫  You're my only reason to live on  ♫

73
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,010
♫  So I'll choose to love you  ♫

74
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:45,140
♫  You're the only place I can rest  ♫

75
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,160
 That day, after she suddenly disappeared like that,

76
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,550
 we couldn't find Seul Bi anywhere.

77
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,550
 Missing Person

78
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,470
Hello.

79
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,470
Please contact me if you see her.

80
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,590
- Okay. 
 - I'd be grateful if you could take a good look.

81
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
I implore you.

82
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,300
Please take a good look.

83
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,100
Thank you.

84
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,710
- Hey, Tae Sik. 
 - Yes?

85
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,650
Let's go somewhere else.

86
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,330
Please contact us if you see her.

87
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,110
Please take a good look at her photo. 
  Missing Person

88
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,500
We'd be grateful for your contact.

89
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,650
It's broad daylight. What's wrong with you?

90
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,390
We have customers, and it's daytime!

91
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,810
Where's Seul Bi?

92
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,500
For goodness sake.

93
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,740
- Seul— 
 - What's with you?

94
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,890
Seul Bi.

95
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,850
Seul Bi!

96
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,150
It's not her.

97
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,370
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

98
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,360
 Missing Person

99
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,140
Aigoo, why is the weather so cold?

100
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,900
We're looking for someone.

101
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,920
Keep an eye out, okay?

102
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,370
And come here and let us know if you see her.

103
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,360
Okay.

104
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,740
- You're looking for someone? 
 - Yes.

105
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,380
Please give us a call if you find her.

106
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,160
Mi Su.

107
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,080
Back then, if I had run away with you,

108
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,120
how would we have ended up?

109
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,170
Would we have been happy?

110
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,230
Do you regret it?

111
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,980
Regret.

112
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,560
Time is like that.

113
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,260
When I had plenty of it ahead of me,

114
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,630
I just let it slip away fleetingly.

115
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,010
But now that it has passed,

116
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:25,090
I can't turn back even a single second with my own power.

117
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,580
Don't regret it

118
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,310
since every moment I spent with you

119
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,340
was precious,

120
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,470
even the painful moments.

121
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,080
If someone reports having seen Seul Bi, please let me know immediately.

122
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,040
Yes, I understand.

123
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,800
It's a package for you, but the sender's name isn't written on it.

124
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,970
All right. You may leave.

125
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,880
 From Seon Sam Joong

126
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,820
 To My Son Min Joon

127
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,570
That bastard Sam Joong

128
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,720
ruined our family like this and disappears as he pleases?

129
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,540
He didn't ruin it. He set it right.

130
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,680
So are you here to gawk?

131
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,990
Or what?

132
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,270
Are you going to forgive me or something?

133
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,000
Eunsung Capital

134
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
will compensate the money that the fund fraud has cost the people

135
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,250
with the total amount of the sales price of Geumhwa Group.

136
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,880
Are you crazy?

137
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,400
How could you sell Geumhwa?

138
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,540
How could you sell that company when you know what that means to us? Huh?

139
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,640
Father left it for you.

140
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,690
Take care of your health, Uncle.

141
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,910
Min Joon, not Geumhwa!

142
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,950
You can't!

143
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,230
Min Joon!

144
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,420
Seon Min Joon!

145
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,350
 The resentment you must've felt toward me all your life...

146
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,030
 I understand it very well.

147
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,310
 I'm sorry for everything.

148
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:57,080
 Throughout my life, the person I felt sorriest for was you, Hyeong.

149
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,390
 Please graciously forgive this unworthy brother of yours,

150
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,370
 Hyeongnim.

151
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,080
This bastard makes me feel terrible until the very end.

152
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,040
This bastard.

153
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,880
What a fool.

154
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,010
What did you come in here for?

155
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,530
I'm not thinking about getting out of here.

156
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,830
I plead guilty to the charges.

157
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,180
Hey, hey.

158
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,960
Hey, man! Dong Sik!

159
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,380
It's here.

160
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,430
Hey, Dong Sik.

161
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,950
- Dong Sik. Dong Sik! 
 - It has come for us.

162
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,160
It's here for us.

163
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,890
Dong Sik. Seon Dong Sik!

164
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,610
It's here for us!

165
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,780
Dong Sik. Dong Sik! Get it together, son!

166
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,050
Come on, Dong Sik. Dong Sik.

167
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,920
Dong Sik, my son.

168
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,610
Where on earth did our Seul Bi disappear to? 
  Missing Person

169
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,650
I should've stuck to her like a barnacle.

170
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,250
Don't worry!

171
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,290
Is Seul Bi just any ordinary person?

172
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,250
She'll return with that strange ability of hers.

173
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,790
Gosh, stop saying the word "strange."

174
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,420
Hyeon Tae.

175
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,900
What are you doing out here?

176
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,470
Try drinking this warm medicinal herb tea.

177
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,370
You need to stay strong at times like this.

178
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,630
Seul Bi will return in no time.

179
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,730
Hyeon Tae, let's have a drink.

180
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,000
Shut it! Why are you drinking in broad daylight?

181
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,240
You're crazy.

182
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,830
She's flipping out.

183
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,570
Anyway, how is Su Gwang doing?

184
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,890
Su Gwang?

185
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,300
He's looking all over the place for Seul Bi. It's not even funny.

186
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,570
What should I do about Brother-in-law?

187
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,070
Stop drinking!

188
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,780
 Seodong Police Station

189
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,510
It's her?

190
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,610
You saw Seul Bi? Where is she right now?

191
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,700
What does she look like?

192
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,140
A bit tall and skinny,

193
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,300
long-haired and has a unique way of naming animals or fish, right?

194
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,930
Su Gwang, it's not her.

195
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,680
Are you sure it's not her?

196
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,040
I took a photo and brought it because she looked similar.

197
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,630
No, it's not her.

198
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,900
Then I don't get a reward?

199
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,080
We said it's not her.

200
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,240
- But she looks similar. 
 - It has to be her for you to get the reward.

201
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,730
- She does look similar, but it's not her. 
 - She's similar.

202
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,260
It's not, it's not. Thank you.

203
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,140
Hang in there.

204
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:22,170
Why on earth did she disappear?

205
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,790
Maybe there was a price Seul Bi had to pay in order to become ordinary.

206
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,180
It's all my fault.

207
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm to blame.

208
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,870
Where do you think she went?

209
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,960
If you two are destined to meet again,

210
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,510
even if you must circle around the earth,

211
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:56,490
you'll surely meet again.

212
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,770
It's snowing, Seul Bi.

213
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,090
♫  On a sunny day with the warm light, suddenly  ♫

214
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,780
You told me that

215
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,160
this necklace will find its owner wherever she may be.

216
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,660
♫  I’m reminded of you  ♫

217
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,350
But I don't know where you are.

218
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:49,160
♫  Whom I buried deep in my heart  ♫

219
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,630
If you could just tell me where,

220
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,300
I'd go and find you right away.

221
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,210
♫  A strong wave is about to swell inside me, who used to be calm  ♫

222
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,730
If you could just tell me.

223
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,690
♫  Waking up from a long, long dream  ♫

224
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,530
Please.

225
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,750
♫  I let you go with the wind that passed me  ♫

226
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,530
 Su Gwang, if we're separated for some reason,

227
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:22,340
 and even if we're far apart, you'll always shine like that star,

228
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,570
 so I can find you.

229
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,050
♫  Why are you shaking my heart that I’ve held back breathless for so long?  ♫

230
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,500
♫  What am I supposed to do if you do this to me now?  ♫

231
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,250
I'm sorry, Seul Bi,

232
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,720
for not being able to protect you.

233
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,500
♫  Because I know  ♫

234
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,420
I'm sorry, Seul Bi.

235
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,520
♫  I can’t let go easily  ♫

236
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,790
I'm sorry, Seul Bi.

237
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,650
♫  I guess I’ve been waiting for you all day  ♫

238
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:02,080
♫  I want to tell you not to come back  ♫

239
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,730
 Time flashed by like the cold edge of a knife.

240
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,800
 Because you weren't here,

241
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,030
 because you weren't here to embrace me warmly,

242
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,070
 time turned into an icy knife

243
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,990
 and passed by, cutting through me coldly.

244
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,540
Hyeong!

245
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,390
- Tae Sik! 
 - What now?

246
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,990
He must've received another call.

247
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,950
Gosh, it's so hard to be a secretary!

248
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,930
I have to search the corners of the earth, day in and day out.

249
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,810
And the phones are turned off, day in and day out.

250
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,710
When in the world is he going to move out of this rooftop?

251
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,600
Hyung, I think I should go visit the South Sea.

252
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,750
Is there news of Miss Seul Bi?

253
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,240
Yeah, somebody said they spotted someone similar to Seul Bi.

254
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,400
It's probably just someone similar again.

255
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,740
Director, it's already the fourth time you postponed the Youngjin Foundation board meeting.

256
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,490
Supervisor Eun Ok Jin assigned this very important task to us,

257
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,530
so we can't push it aside.

258
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,800
- Seul Bi is Seul Bi, but— 
 - Hey!

259
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,580
How dare you speak of Miss Seul Bi like that?

260
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,070
That's not what I—

261
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,240
What will we do about the board meeting?

262
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,800
What... what will you do about the board meeting?

263
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,890
N-Next year's budget has been reviewed and agreed on by all the directors.

264
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,750
All you need to do is approve it, okay?

265
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,380
The rest can be done via video meeting!

266
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,750
Video meeting, okay?

267
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,570
Video meeting!

268
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,770
Why didn't I think of that?

269
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,210
What are you doing? Get in.

270
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,790
Okay.

271
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,400
♫  On a day not too long ago  ♫

272
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,700
♫  On the day you were by my side  ♫

273
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,730
♫  Green leaves grew on the sunny street  ♫

274
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,070
♫  Everything in this world was delightful  ♫

275
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,010
You're the one who called me, right?

276
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,670
♫  It was hard  ♫

277
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,590
- I saw her over there. 
 - Over there?

278
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,640
♫  Knowing that the years will pass, and I'll be sad  ♫

279
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,740
- Anybody home? 
 - Who's there?

280
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,820
Hello, Grandma.

281
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,450
By any chance, is there a tall, long-haired, pale-faced

282
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,380
woman who uses long names for animals here?

283
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,230
Gyeong Ja?

284
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,120
Oh, Gyeong Ja.

285
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,780
It's a miss this time, too. Gosh.

286
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,320
Belonging to the cephalopod order...

287
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,480
It is a mollusk squid!

288
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,690
It's our Gyeong Ja for sure.

289
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,730
Gyeong Ja.

290
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,460
Yeah! I caught a white shark, a sea fish of the family Acrididae!

291
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,690
Gyeong Ja!

292
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,330
Grandma, what is it?

293
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,890
These young men came looking for you again.

294
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,980
Seul Bi.

295
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
Who are you?

296
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,700
I'm Gyeong Ja. Oh Gyeong Ja.

297
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,550
That's the name of my daughter who ran away long ago.

298
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,760
This girl wound up here with no memory of her name,

299
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,030
so I just call her Gyeong Ja.

300
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,200
Geez, Grandma. I told you I'm going to be your granddaughter.

301
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,220
Shut it, kid.

302
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,750
Then I'm not going to massage your shoulder anymore.

303
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,650
I have this anyway.

304
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,960
- Geez, you're so unfair! 
 - Aigoo, aigoo.

305
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,380
- Aigoo, aigoo. 
 - Grandma, I'll do it for you.

306
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,210
The face is the same, but...

307
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,470
Wh-What's going on?

308
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,220
Aigoo, that feels good.

309
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,810
- This feels way better, right? 
 - Yeah, it feels really nice.

310
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,140
- I told you. 
 - Aigoo, my beautiful Gyeong Ja.

311
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,570
Lower, lower.

312
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,800
I want to stay by Miss Seul Bi's side, too.

313
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,710
But I can't leave my Hyeon Su alone.

314
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,040
Yeah, Hyeon Su must be waiting for you.

315
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,010
Hurry back.

316
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,100
You— I mean,

317
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,480
Director, are you going to stay here until Seul Bi's memories return?

318
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,150
Let's just take Seul Bi back with us.

319
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,270
It might shock her if we force her to.

320
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,040
Go on ahead.

321
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,900
Fine.

322
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,650
We'll go back first.

323
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,200
Sure.

324
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:38,550
 Coffee

325
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,250
Aigoo, it's so cold.

326
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,260
Ah, seriously...

327
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,360
Gyeong Ja!

328
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,850
Gyeong Ja.

329
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,050
- Huh, what? 
 - You should go outside.

330
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,540
Why?

331
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,200
Aigoo, just go outside.

332
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,750
Who are you?

333
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,180
Oppa?

334
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,430
A younger brother?

335
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,620
Boyfriend?

336
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,480
Or do you have a debt to collect from me?

337
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,910
- It's actually a— 
 - Long story, right?

338
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,400
It's probably a long story.

339
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,970
That's what everyone says.

340
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,010
Since I don't know my own name and seem stupid,

341
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,880
the number of men who lied to me and tried to take me away...

342
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,590
are about a big boxful.

343
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,180
"I'm your boyfriend," "I'm your oppa,"

344
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,400
or "we're married."

345
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,370
I won't fall for it now,

346
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,510
so just leave.

347
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,330
 Coffee
 Take Out

348
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,630
♫  The sky is much more dazzling tonight  ♫

349
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,860
♫  Than the shining midday sun  ♫

350
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,650
♫  Sweet like a dream, sweeter than sunshine?  ♫

351
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,520
♫  I’ll dance as I fall into your eyes  ♫

352
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,100
♫  I don’t know why I’m trembling  ♫

353
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,650
♫  The way you look at me is a bit different than usual  ♫

354
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,460
♫  I'm sure you already know  ♫

355
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,300
♫  My heart is filled with you  ♫

356
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,830
♫  It all seems like a lie, fly in the sky  ♫

357
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,370
♫  What do I do when even the wind is so sweet?  ♫

358
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,920
♫  If I could hold your hand  ♫

359
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,450
Grandpa!

360
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,640
♫  I believe I could fly anywhere  ♫

361
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,980
I'm here!

362
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,720
Gyeong Ja, you're here?

363
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,180
How have you been?

364
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,400
I've been good.

365
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,110
♫  Even the stars that were wandering  ♫

366
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,330
♫  I'm not gonna be lonely today  ♫

367
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:54,310
♫  Bling like champagne with your shining voice  ♫

368
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,000
♫  Say my name again  ♫

369
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,690
♫  I don’t know why I’m trembling  ♫

370

♫  The way you look at me is a bit different than usual  ♫

371
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,900
Seul Bi, are you okay?

372
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,240
Seul Bi, let me see.

373
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,900
♫  I'm sure you already know  ♫

374
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,280
♫  My heart is filled with you  ♫

375
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,320
Are you okay?

376
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,280
Yes, I'm fine.

377
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,710
♫  What do I do when even the wind is so sweet?  ♫

378
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,920

380
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,670
Thank you.

381
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,700
Let's go.

382
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,020
This looks so good.

383
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,420
Thank you so much for this!

384
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,300
Sure.

385
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,050
Is it good?

386
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,310
It's so good.

387
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,690
♫  The moment I first saw you  ♫

388
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,920
♫  I knew it was you  ♫

389
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
♫  You must have known when you saw my trembling eyes  ♫

390
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,700
♫  Please notice me  ♫

391
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,880
♫  I'll smile a little more  ♫

392
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,230
♫  I'll look at you a little longer  ♫

393
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:40,110
♫  Please notice my feelings for you  ♫

394
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:48,420
♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please be with me  ♫

395
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:58,340
♫  If you hold my hand, I don't mind flying even higher  ♫

396

♫  I'm in love  ♫

397
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:06,880
♫  The road we walk alone together  ♫

398
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,150
♫  For your love  ♫

399
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:16,720
♫  We will never be again  ♫

400
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,220
I'll be back again.

401
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,830
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

402
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,790
♫  Do you feel the same as I do?  ♫

403
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,210
This is on the house.

404
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,480
 Gummy worms

405
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,670
♫  Come closer  ♫

406
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,290
It's an earthworm belonging to the Annelida clitellata lumbriculida family.

407
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,830
You know your stuff.

408
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,050
Your hobby must be similar to mine.

409
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,490
If I called its name with great effort,

410
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,530
I thought I'd be able to meet you.

411
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,940
♫  I think I know now  ♫

412
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:07,730
♫  I'm like that right now  ♫

413
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:15,550
♫  I feel like I'm walking above the clouds, please be with me  ♫

414
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:24,580
♫  If you hold my hand, I don't mind flying even higher  ♫

415
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,090
Excuse me!

416
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,650
How

417
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,740
do you know me?

418
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,690
It's actually

419
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,520
a long story.

420
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,070
I beg of you.

421
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,090
I beg of you.

422
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,890
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired.

423
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,660
Hey, you're going to jinx it.

424
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,960
I beg of you. I beg of you.

425
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,680
I beg of you to return Miss Seul Bi's memories.

426
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,140
Who believes in these superstitions nowadays, Hyungnim?

427
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,560
You're going to jinx it, man!

428
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,290
The world is full of spiritual energy we're unaware of.

429
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:47,780
Otherwise, how would you explain the abilities Miss Seul Bi showed us?

430
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,430
Is that so?

431
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,730
That's true.

432
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,760
Whatever it is, having faith and sincerity is important.

433
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,770
That's right.

434
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,140
God, Buddha, Divine Spirit,

435
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,880
please let Seul Bi's memories return.

436
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,650
Who dares to call at this time?

437
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,260
Yeah, Su Gwang—

438
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,380
I mean, Director.

439
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,870
Why did you come? You must be busy.

440
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,100
You've been through a lot, Ajussi.

441
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,820
I heard you found Seul Bi?

442
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,720
Let's discuss it on the way.

443
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,170
Oh my gosh.

444
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,210
- No, Noona. 
 - That was so gratifying!

445
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,150
- What? 
 - Isn't the judge so cool?

446
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,730
"The past investigative agency collected evidence

447
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,580
for illegal activities and such...

448
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,510
- and declared him not guilty."
 - Geez, hey!

449
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,480
Anyway, what's important now

450
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,950
is that we destroyed the original verdict,

451
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,420
and our ajussi was found not guilty!

452
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,910
That's what I'm saying!

453
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,610
Exactly.

454
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:59,600
You've been through so much, Hyeon Tae.

455
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,830
I wanted to give this to you for a while,

456
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,580
but I held onto it until I could be acquitted.

457
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,840
Oh my.

458
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,510
You shouldn't have.

459
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,710
You shouldn't have. Oh my goodness.

460
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,370
Kids, look at the size of the diamond.

461
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,580
It's so pretty!

462
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,670
It fits just right.

463
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:32,290
Then Ajussi and our mom just have to set a wedding date, right?

464
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,990
Our marriage certificate should suffice. What wedding?

465
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,140
Once was enough.

466
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,920
I've never been married before.

467
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,240
Gosh, Mom!

468
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,090
Why would you say that and upset our ajussi?

469
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,320
Since when were you on his side, you wench?

470
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,510
Can't you tell?

471
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,470
She's like this because of his compensation.

472
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,640
Hey!

473
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,970
It's not like that. Shut it.

474
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,940
What do you mean it isn't?

475
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,130
Fine.

476
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,460
When I get my compensation,

477
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,380
let's open a second chicken restaurant under Eun Joong's name.

478
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,610
Really?

479
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,050
- What about a third branch? 
 - Fine.

480
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:04,920
Let's open a third branch, too!

481
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,010
- Really? 
 - Hey, you.

482
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,220
Get accepted to college first, you repeater.

483
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,350
You have to get accepted to college so I can have a wedding.

484
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,660
Study! You should study.

485
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,420
It's Su Gwang.

486
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,400
Su Gwang?

487
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,730
Stop drinking! Why are you drinking in broad daylight?

488
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,620
Didn't Seul Bi contact you at all?

489
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,890
Gosh, bring me the jeon (Korean fried pancake).

490
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,770
- Jeon, jeon, jeon. 
 - Okay!

491
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,810
Coming! It's a perfect scallion pancake.

492
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,690
Yum! Looks good.

493
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,420
Our Seul Bi would go crazy for this scallion pancake.

494
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,050
- Stop with the waterworks 
 - They found her!

495
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,350
- and just eat. 
 - Huh? Huh?

496
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,380
- They found her! 
 - What?

497
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,740
They found Seul Bi! Seul Bi!

498
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,790
- Really? 
 - Seul Bi?

499
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,620
Yeah!

500
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,740
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

501
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,650
You always make fun of me!

502
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,910
I'm not! It's for real this time.

503
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,940
Su Gwang called me and said they found Seul Bi!

504
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,520
- Goodness gracious! 
 - They found Seul Bi?

505
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,320
Where is she? Let's go! Let's go!

506
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,810
Seul Bi! Seul Bi!

507
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,080
Seul Bi.

508
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,720
Greet him.

509
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,000
He's your oppa.

510
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,810
Seon Min Joon.

511
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,110
And this is Min Joon's fiancée, Jang Gyeong.

512
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,430
Nice to meet you.

513
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,050
I'm glad you're okay, Seul Bi.

514
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,950
How much does she not remember?

515
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:22,440
She can remember basic knowledge related to daily living or the content of books,

516
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,410
but she can't remember anything about people.

517
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,630
I lived in a place like this?

518
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,910
What kind of house is this?

519
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,920
Whose taste is this?

520
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,400
Would you like to see your room, too?

521
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,380
Yeah.

522
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,830
Follow me.

523
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,750
So fluffy!

524
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:05,140
I heard your mom made everything in this room.

525
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,360
The curtains, blankets,

526
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,630
and even all the dolls.

527
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,290
There are so many books.

528
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,270
"Jellyfish?"

529
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,840
Why?

530
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,090
I really must be stupid.

531
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,200
How can I not remember my own mom?

532
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,730

533
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,790
Seodong Market?

534
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,870
What is this place?

535
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,570
The friends you love the most have invited you.

536
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,060
Do you want to meet them?

537
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,260
Sure.

538
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,290
Why do I have so many lines?

539
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,070
You should've memorized them.

540
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,210
Mrs. Smile, maybe...

541
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,020
- Aigoo. 
 - Smile, Smile!

542
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,280
Everyone!

543
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,130
The unlucky Go Myeong Seong is coming to work today!

544
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:02,740
Wow! It's the most unlucky Go Myeong Seong!

545
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,660
Get lost!

546
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,510
Don't talk to him! Don't talk to him!

547
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,040
When will I be able to do business without seeing Go Myeong Seong?

548
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,250
Unlucky, Go Myeong Seong!

549
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,380
Get out of our market!

550
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,550
Get out!

551
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,070
Get out!

552
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,400
Who's Go Myeong Seong?

553
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,020
You said you're Gong Su Gwang.

554
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,430
Yeah.

555
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,170
Why don't the people like you?

556
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,580
Oh, no one liked me until you came along.

557
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,000
You have an arrogant personality, don't you? 
  (TN: Same word is used for "arrogant' and "unlucky.")

558
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,260
Rather than personality, let's say they disliked my entire existence.

559
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:41,500
Who in the world is this woman?

560
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,950
Why is she stealing all my regular customers?

561
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:50,400
My husband absolutely devastated me by doing Keticoin.

562
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,930
Hold on! Are you getting a feeling?

563
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,340
You know Keticoin, right? The cat.

564
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,270
Meow!

565
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,900
Should we raise it or not?

566
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,480
- Raise it. 
 - Raise—

567
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,800
F-Fail.

568
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,380
- Don't. 
 - Hey, Wang!

569
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,940
Wang! Your turn.

570
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,950
Mr. Wang, you pushover.

571
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,670
How would I know the doctor?

572
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,850
My son is the pitiful one.

573
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,360
Aigoo, thank you, Miss Seul Bi!

574
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,480
My son, Hyeon Su, underwent eye surgery thanks to you.

575
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,830
I'll pledge my loyalty to you from now on!

576
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,950
It itches! It itches! I'm going crazy from the itching!

577
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,430
Take this off for me. Take it off.

578
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,430
Take it off.

579
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,980
That stung.

580
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,390
- He's overacting. 
 - What the?

581
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,460
- You're overacting! 
 - Hey!

582
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,150
You're perfect!

583
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,180
This kkwabaegi is perfect,

584
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,810
and Seul Bi Noona is perfect, too.

585
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,180
That's right, Yeong Wu.

586
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,380
Seul Bi is perfect.

587
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,110
Anyway, we need to take our Jjong to Busan.

588
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,350
- Who will do that for us? 
 - For us?

589
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,080
Here. 
  The Coast of Busan

590
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,360
Should we take him to Busan?

591
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,560
A roundtrip to Busan is 10 hours.

592
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,040
Ten thousand won per hour, deal!

593
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,640
H-Hold on. Hold on.

594
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,150
Aigoo, Seul Bi!

595
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,860
I'm your dad!

596
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,570
Do you know much I've missed you for the last 20 years, Seul Bi?

597
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,990
This ajussi is weird.

598
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,940
Weird?

599
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,660
I'm weird?

600
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,330
Our Hyeon Tae is hurt.

601
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,860
What's so weird about him? He's your dad.

602
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,410
- Am I weird? 
 - No, you're so cool!

603
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,370
- Why am I weird? 
 - She's just...

604
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,440
What's wrong with her?

605
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,160
You didn't go along with the script!

606
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,520
Ad lib. Ad lib.

607
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,860
Who's next?

608
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,730
- Mr. Hong, it's you. 
 - Me?

609
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,420
Go ahead.

610
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,540
Hey!

611
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,220
Did you hear the rumor?

612
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,980
Our Seul Bi isn't Mr. Jeong's daughter.

613
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:54,140
She's the daughter of Geumhwa Group Chairman Seon Sam Joong!

614
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,490
Oh my!

615
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,800
Our Seul Bi is the daughter of a chaebol family.

616
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,400
Hey! You think being a chaebol's daughter is everything?

617
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,800
I liked Su Gwang first, so you should back off.

618
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,720
Shut it, you wench. They said to go with the script.

619
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,390
Seul Bi.

620
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,400
Try to remember.

621
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,910
Thanks to you, our chicken restaurant created an incredible sauce,

622
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,100
and it was a big hit!

623
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,750
Seul Bi is a goddess of good fortune!

624
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,390
Goddess of good fortune!

625
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,660
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

626
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,610
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

627
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,560
♪ Happy birthday, dear Seul Bi! ♪

628
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,560
Memory, return!

629
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,690
Return!

630
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,320
Did it return?

631
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,890
Did it return?

632
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,450
This is no fun.

633
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,890
These people are all terrible actors.

634
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,530
Oh my.

635
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,900
I like these gummy worms.

636
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,260
What about this card?

637
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,840
- This is what you like, Seul Bi. 
 - A credit card for everyone.

638
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,420
- Hey, Seul Bi. 
 - It's for everyone.

639
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,270
I can't remember anything!

640
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:19,230
You know, if you suffer memory loss, does your personality change, too?

641
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,260
She hasn't changed a bit.

642
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,660
She's confident, pretty, and good at speaking her mind.

643
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,020
- That fool. 
 - What's wrong with him?

644
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,470
Anyway, good work.

645
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,780
Good job! I'm going!

646
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,460
- Goodbye. Goodbye. 
 - Come again.

647
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,930
- Okay. 
 - Bye.

648
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,270
Everything was great,

649
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,940
but it was slightly lacking. Slightly.

650
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,160
- Geez. 
 - You overacted.

651
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,910
- Really? 
 - Was our acting lacking?

652
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,720
I did well.

653
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,910
You didn't do well!

654
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,610
I lived here? With you? 
  Seul Bi's To Do List

655
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,030
Yeah.

656
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:18,750
♫  The sky is so more dazzling tonight  ♫

657
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:23,000
♫  Than the shining midday sun  ♫

658
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,740
♫  Sweet like a dream, sweeter than sunshine?  ♫

659
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,110
It's me.

660
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,700
♫  I’ll dance as I fall into your eyes  ♫

661
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,150
It is.

662
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:36,240
Is there anything you remember?

663
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,610
♫  The way you look at me is a bit different than usual  ♫

664
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,740
♫  I'm sure you already know  ♫

665
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,250
What did I do while living here?

666
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,850
Huh?

667
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:52,210
What do you mean by that?

668
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,710
You said we were dating.

669
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:58,250
When a male and a female are together at night—

670
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,140
♫  If I could hold your hand  ♫

671
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,750
Does loss of memory cause loss of social skills, too?

672
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,460
What is this girl saying?

673
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,970
You're so shy.

674
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,930
I'm not shy at all.

675
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,060
Nothing happened between you and me.

676
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,280
Nothing at all?

677
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,860
Well, I guess

678
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,430
we just kissed.

679
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:25,380
Oh, just kissed?

680
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,610
How was it?

681
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,090
What?

682
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,500
The kiss.

683
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,190
How was it?

684
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,790
Try to remember if you're that curious.

685
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,490
So petty.

686
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,970
You want me to tell you?

687
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,400
Yeah.

688
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,800
♫  What do I do when even the wind is so sweet?  ♫

689
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,710
♫  If I could hold your hand  ♫

690
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:53,430
♫  I believe I could fly anywhere  ♫

691
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,190
That feels so unsettling.

692
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,640
- Why? 
 - Because I don't have any memory.

693
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,590
It feels like you're boasting about kissing some other girl.

694
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,940
 Rustle, rustle. The sound of leaves falling.

695
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,420
What is this?

696
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,980
My new piece.

697
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,860
Seon Seul Bi and Gong Su Gwang are the main characters.

698
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,410
I thought you only write about me.

699
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:26,620
You said I'm the main character.

700
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,710
You're not a chaebol anymore, Oppa.

701
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,680
So you're not my main character anymore.

702
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,210
You're my man.

703
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,600
I'm jealous.

704
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,140
Right?

705
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,660
I'm jealous, too.

706
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:44,600
We've postponed our dating and marriage for one year

707
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,370
because we were looking for Miss Seul Bi.

708
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,350
We need to catch up as well.

709
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,780
What are you doing tonight?

710
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,280
I have time, but you don't.

711
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,760
Why?

712
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,550
Are you aware that your sales dropped since your last piece?

713
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,430
Even the views dropped by 2,000.

714
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:05,200
Tonight, let's grind your soul into your work all night in your writing studio.

715
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,840
So mean.

716
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,440
Is that something you should say to your girlfriend?

717
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,160
Technically, I'm not your boyfriend right now.

718
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,100
I'm speaking as the CEO of Contents Mix,

719
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,030
the dark horse of web novel platforms.

720
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,420
Yes, CEO.

721
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,270
I think I should get back to work now.

722
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,110
Take care.

723
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,030
So refreshing.

724
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,610
I don't remember,

725
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,520
but I do like you.

726
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,180
I just do.

727
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,040
You're like a prince.

728
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,230
Seul Bi.

729
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,780
Should we

730
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,550
get married?

731
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:17,560
 Thank you to our channel manager: Justine_desmoulins.

732
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:23,030

733
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:27,860
 Thank you to our segment A&amp;C team: Bepina (chief) and Pilar_velasquez.

734
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,520
 Thank you to our English editors: Joysprite (chief) and SignsofSerendipity.

735
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,890
 Thank you to our translation editor: Laks_727.

736
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,780
 Thank you to our cover page designer: Justine_desmoulins.

737
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,390
 Even if you were to get your memories back,

738
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:46,050
 there'd be more bad memories than good ones.

739
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,570
 Would she need to get her memories back?

740
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,680
 Seul Bi is getting married, Father.

741
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,110
 It's the day our family

742
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,770
 desperately wished for with all of our hearts.

743
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:07,470
 Only happiness awaits my precious sister from now on, right?

744
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:11,350
 Please come see for yourself as well, Father.

745
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,430
 I miss you, Father.

746
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,790
This is so pretty.

747
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,330
The wedding venue is so pretty and

748
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,290
Seul Bi is also very beautiful today.

749
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,500
This is such a drama.

750
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:33,130
Oppa, I think I should use this in my novel.

751
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,720
Seul Bi.

752
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,480
Please be happy.

753
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,110
Thank you,

754
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,370
Oppa.

755
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,740
Miss Seul Bi!

756
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,130
Congratulations!

757
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,260
Please live happily ever after, okay?

758
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,800
Please be happy, Miss Seul Bi!

759
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,430
So pretty.

760
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,950
Thank you, everyone.

761
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,180
Though I don't remember you all that well...

762
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,180
What's so important about memories?

763
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,470
- You just need to live happily. 
 - That's right.

764
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,020
- My gosh! 
 - I'm so happy for you.

765
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,110
- She's so pretty! 
 - I'm so envious.

766
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,250
One, two, three!

767
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,990
My darling, Kim Jeong Tae.

768
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,070
He's so happy.

769
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,050
He's just happy.

770
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:29,350
Does it make sense to marry when her memories are not back yet?

771
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,810
- It is a little— 
 - Well, it's definitely not logical.

772
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:35,610
Love is so much more intense than a memory!

773
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,650
You're saying that so intensely.

774
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,600
Of course, it is intense.

775
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,580
I'm intense for you.

776
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,540
You're a grinder with a powerful motor.

777
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,830
That's why you ground my life into it, you know?

778
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,300
Is that why you nag him so intensely, too?

779
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,330
Intensely!

780
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,730
Gosh, anyway, he's so weird.

781
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,980
Why are rich people having their wedding at the market?

782
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,320
I was looking forward to forking down some hotel food.

783
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,780
- Shut your mouth. 
 - Shut up.

784
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,980
Shut your mouth.

785
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,550
Eun Joong, ours will be at the hotel with course meals.

786
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:09,340
Yeah, you should have it at the hotel.

787
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,760
You made a lot of money, no?

788
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,720
I'm telling you, the rich are worse.

789
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,080
That Hollywood actress Angelina or Jolina, was it?

790
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,160
They say she drinks a dollar coffee when she has tens of trillions of dollars.

791
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,840
That stingy cheapskate Gong Su Gwang.

792
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,600
Quit your complaining now.

793
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,900
Why do you mouth off about the groom on the day of the wedding?

794
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,590
That's because it is the day of wedding.

795
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:29,250
They used to hang the groom upside down and beat the

796
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,140
soles of his feet on the day of the wedding, right?

797
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,070
That's right.

798
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,120
That's why I became so short.

799
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,470
Anyhow, I'm so nervous about being the officiant.

800
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:40,720
What do I do about my nerves?

801
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,310
Why are you so nervous?

802
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:46,230
People would think that you're getting married today, Mr. Park.

803
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,660
That's why I have my message written on paper.

804
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,510
Good job.

805
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,520
Wait a minute.

806
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,080
- What's up? 
 - Did you lose it?

807
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,830
- I'm sure it was here— 
 - Geez, Mr. Park.

808
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:56,010
How could you lose that?

809
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,550
I must've dropped it somewhere!

810
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:01,050
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Just do as you usually would.

811
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,650
Do it oddly.

812
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:03,790
Yeah, just do it oddly.

813
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,990
- Oddly? 
 - Yes.

814
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,830
Su Gwang, are you okay?

815
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,440
I-I can't b-breathe.

816
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,840
Breathe! Breathe in and out, Su Gwang!

817
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,770
Deep breath, deep breath!

818
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,490
Hey, Su Gwang! Su Gwang!

819
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:19,600
Oh, Jang Geun, you're here!

820
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,680
- It's Ch-Cheongsimhwan. 
 - Cheongsimhwan? Cheongsimhwan? Cheongsimhwan? 
  (TN: Pill to relax the nerves.)

821
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:31,440

822
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:33,610
Cheongsimhwan. Is it working?

823
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

824
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,110
Hey, Su Gwang.

Wait, Hyeong. It's still in my mouth.

827
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,580
Aren't you going to get married? Swallow it already.

828

Yeah?

875
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,480
This is our son.

Hi.

877
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,320
 Though the Seul Bi in my memory never came back,

878
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:36,560
 I'm now living with a wife who's more beautiful.

Oh, you're awake, Si Hyeon.

 More happily and more fiercely.

881
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,240
Aigoo. You must've dropped a load.

Seul Bi.

Please change Si Hyeon's diaper.

Wake up and eat. Hurry.

Yes, yes.
