1
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Listen to me, guys

2
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,750
Last night,

3
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,750
I had another dream about the end of the world

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,458
So?

5
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,125
This one was especially clear

6
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,458
Exactly the same as what I had read in the magazine

7
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:44,958
You're repeating your final year

8
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,083
How do you still have time for magazines?

9
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:46,583
Shut up

10
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,583
According to the Maya Calendar,

11
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,958
the earth will meet its end in the 5216th year

12
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,208
And that…

13
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,250
will be the end of the world

14
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:55,583
Wait a minute,

15
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,208
since that will happen 5216 years later,

16
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,958
what does it have to do with us right now?

17
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,708
You idiot

18
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,500
It's calculated according to the Maya Calendar

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,083
The earth can only exist for 5216 years

20
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,500
The last day…

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,333
will be Dec. 21st, 2012

22
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,750
What? Right in this year?

23
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,333
Exactly

24
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,458
Then what will happen, Xiaonan?

25
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,708
There are a few possibilities

26
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,833
The first is a meteor strike

27
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,833
The second is a sulfur acid rain

28
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,583
All cellphones, electric devices, and computers

29
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,458
will break down

30
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,833
Does that mean the College Entrance Exam will be cancelled?

31
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,000
In your dreams

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,416
We'll still have to take the exam

33
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,708
What's that?

34
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:31,458
Run!

35
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,250
Where are we going?

36
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:39,833
Ah!

37
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,375
Youshu

38
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,125
Youshu

39
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,833
Couldn't you leave me alone for a while, Song Xiaonan?

40
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,333
I was sleeping

41
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,333
How dare you throw a ball at me, Xu Youshu?

42
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:54,708
On your feet

43
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,333
Just forget it

44
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,333
On your feet

45
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:56,458
Just let it go

46
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,000
Everybody just calm down

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,333
You don't have to wait till the end of the world

48
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,458
Today will be the end of your life

49
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,750
Xu Youshu, get on your feet

50
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,583
What are you doing? Keep quiet

51
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:06,875
Dear class,

52
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:07,625
today

53
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,583
I'm going to introduce a new student

54
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,708
Here, please come to the podium

55
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,083
This student

56
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,625
just transferred to Shenghua Senior Repeating Class

57
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,208
from another school

58
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,458
Her name is Lin Xiangzhi

59
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,750
Please welcome her with a warm clap

60
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,375
Hello, everyone, I am Lin Xiangzhi

61
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,000
All the students down there

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,625
are going to become your friends

63
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,250
who will keep you company day and night

64
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,375
Come on Take a seat over there

65
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:05,625
Sir,

66
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,000
Xu Youshu is playing basketball in class again

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,083
Song Xiaonan

68
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:08,625
Stop there

69
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,208
You

70
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,750
Xu Youshu, what is your problem?

71
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,125
Song Xiaonan,

72
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,708
how can you try to frame a classmate?

73
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,750
Have you got any idea of the urgency?

74
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,583
How come you just won't concentrate?

75
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,958
Do you want to take the College Entrance Exam or not?

76
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,000
Xu Youshu,

77
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,625
go and clean the gym warehouse

78
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,250
after the noon break

79
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,125
go and clean the gym warehouse

80
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,708
Song Xiaonan,

81
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,958
you'll have to clean the library

82
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:27,625
Three days in a row

83
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,833
Sir, it was his fault

84
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,375
No, it was she

85
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:29,708
Knock it off

86
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,750
End of this question

87
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,458
Let's move on with our lessons

88
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,750
First we'll go over

89
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,583
what we learned in the last class

90
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,333
We've learned the trigonometric function of acute angles,

91
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,708
which is a function

92
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,208
with the variation of acute angles,

93
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,583
and the functional value of ratios

94
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,416
Song Xiaonan

95
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,208
With mushrooms and pork

96
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:05,708
You know what

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,208
Song Xiaonan made such an accurate hit

98
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,708
Hey, by the way,

99
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,958
I suppose if you're really going to start a fight,

100
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,083
you would be no match for her

101
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,250
I gave her a break just because

102
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,958
she would be my elder brother's wife

103
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,583
What are you talking about?

104
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,958
Song Xiaonan has a crush on you

105
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,833
Everybody in our class knows it

106
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,083
Just mind your own business

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,875
The whole morning,

108
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:31,708
you just couldn't take your eyes off the transfer student

109
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,250
You think I've never noticed that?

110
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't talk nonsense

111
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,250
She was the one that kept looking at me

112
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,583
So, is that supposed to be love at first sight?

113
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,625
Even if you call it love at first sight,

114
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,375
she's the one that set it up

115
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,458
Last week I just watched a movie

116
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,583
about love at first sight

117
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,333
Here it is

118
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,625
Trust me

119
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,583
It's really amazing

120
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,083
That's it?

121
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,833
Hey, don't underestimate it

122
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,958
This is the guide book of puberty romance

123
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,083
for millions of girls

124
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,083
Jiang Wu,

125
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,125
do you need to borrow a DVD?I can help you with that

126
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,500
No, thanks I've already got it

127
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,333
I haven't finished reading

128
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,083
A little thing called love

129
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,208
You're repeating your final year

130
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,083
How can you indulge yourself

131
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,083
in romantic stuff like that?

132
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:32,833
You've gone too far

133
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,083
This is Jiang Wu's DVD

134
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,958
That's so sweet

135
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,708
But we're still students now

136
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,833
I think study is our foremost priority

137
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,958
No, it was Youshu that wanted this DVD

138
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,708
Zip it That's nonsense

139
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,583
It was really Youshu

140
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,375
Song Xiaonan,

141
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,375
the next time you want to start talking trash,

142
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,250
could you please take the audience's feelings

143
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,333
into consideration?

144
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,083
For what purpose would Xu Youshu borrow a DVD like this?

145
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,458
It's like a blossom on an iron tree

146
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,708
All right, I'm an iron tree

147
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,333
But you're just a dry tree with no sprouts

148
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,708
You're calling me a dry tree?

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,833
Yeah

150
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,833
I'll make your tears dry

151
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,833
How come you always start fighting every time

152
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,708
you meet each other?

153
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,000
You threw a ball at me in class

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,125
I haven't got even with you for that

155
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:27,666
How's that?

156
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,291
Isn't it awesome?

157
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,291
Of course it is

158
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,625
I've learned a few tricks in the DVD you've recommended

159
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,458
Check it out

160
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,125
You can do this

161
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,750
Go!

162
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,166
Lin Xiangzhi,

163
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,000
here's bottle of orange juice

164
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,625
A humble gift of sincerity

165
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,000
I wonder if we can become good friends?

166
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,250
I'll help you put the straw in

167
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,958
My clothes are damp

168
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,083
Juice stained damn

169
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,625
I, I

170
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,291
Hey

171
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,125
Lin

172
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,083
Lin

173
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,625
Lin Xiangzhi

174
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,625
I didn't mean to do that

175
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,583
Wait a second

176
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,625
Lin

177
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm so sorry

178
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,458
Give me a chance to say sorry

179
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:34,583
Ah!

180
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:37,833
Are you all right?

181
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,583
What is your problem?

182
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,375
How could we be all right?

183
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,833
We were almost knocked over

184
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,083
Lin Xiangzhi,

185
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,958
just tell me if he dares to bully you again

186
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,875
I'll make him pay

187
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,208
Read after me

188
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:46,833
Okay?

189
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,583
Everything that happened that night

190
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,208
was obliberated

191
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:50,833
from her memory

192
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,791
Everything that happened that night

193
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,000
was obliberated

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,666
from her memory

195
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,083
Stay in sync, okay?

196
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,916
One, two, begin

197
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,416
Everything that happened that night

198
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,833
was obliberated from her memory

199
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,333
Dear Xiangzhi

200
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,583
I am Youshu

201
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,875
Let's go to the movies

202
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,208
Shall we?

203
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,583
One, two, begin!

204
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,583
Sir, Xu Youshu just disturbed a classmate

205
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,083
with a note

206
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,208
Xu Youshu, it’s you again!

207
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,583
Can't you just behave yourself and listen carefully?

208
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,375
Yes,Madam

209
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,166
Don't laugh

210
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,833
Lin Xiangzhi

211
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,708
Go, go, go

212
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,000
Well, this is for you

213
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,750
Hey, Lin Xiangzhi

214
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,208
Wait a second

215
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,083
The stupid thing I did

216
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,250
was just a mistake

217
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,500
I'm not some kind of weirdo or nerd

218
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,500
I just want to know you better

219
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,833
I have got this thought

220
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,208
since the first day you transferred to this school

221
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:08,625
So,

222
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,125
please read this letter

223
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,125
Hold your horses

224
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,125
Youshu just wants to be friends with her

225
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:20,750
No way

226
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,333
Hey, don't go there

227
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,291
All right I'll wait for a bit longer

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,458
I'd like…

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,458
I'd like to be your friend

230
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,916
What do you mean?

231
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,291
Have I told you that I need you to be my friend?

232
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,583
I don't wanna be friends with you

233
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,708
Please don't get so close to me

234
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,208
Hello, mom

235
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,541
Xiangzhi,

236
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,875
how's everything going?

237
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:13,750
Why haven't you been heard much

238
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,083
since you moved into your aunt's home?

239
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,958
Have you caused her any trouble?

240
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,666
There's nothing wrong

241
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,833
Fine, then.

242
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,708
What matters most now is your study

243
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,000
You must make up for

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,958
what you have left behind

245
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,083
Do you understand?

246
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,375
Mom,

247
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,458
I

248
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,958
What's the matter?

249
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,000
I just wonder

250
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,375
if I can change school again?

251
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,583
What's wrong?

252
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,333
Have you got into any trouble over there?

253
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,708
No

254
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,708
Not really

255
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,583
Remember to take the pills

256
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,583
Stop imagining things

257
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,333
Goodbye then

258
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,333
Jiang Wu

259
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,333
Youshu

260
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,083
Is everything all right?

261
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,083
You know pretty well what kind of person I am

262
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,958
That's true. You never admit defeat

263
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,708
Do you think

264
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,083
I need to explain that to her?

265
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,083
The letter I gave her that day

266
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,583
was just so sudden

267
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,708
Lin Xiangzhi

268
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,833
What's up?

269
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,458
The letter I gave you last week

270
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,708
might make you feel awkward

271
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,708
I apologize for that

272
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,833
Who are you?

273
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:11,833
I

274
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,833
I am Xu Youshu

275
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,125
I don't know you at all

276
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,750
What a kill shot lesson learned

277
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,500
For what purpose did she say that?

278
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,125
Is it reluctant acceptance?

279
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,666
I don't think this is the right term to describe it

280
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,625
This is obviously just a polite refusal

281
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,500
You guys

282
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,250
What are you doing here, looking so shady?

283
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,625
Your desk mate is so unpredictable

284
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,000
A weekend has passed

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
and now she says she doesn't know Xu Youshu at all

286
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,875
What?

287
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,958
So much for this class

288
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,625
We will have a test tomorrow

289
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,916
Xu Youshu

290
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:56,750
Yes Ma'am

291
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,833
I'm watching you

292
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,375
You must carefully review the lessons

293
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:01,958
Let's call it a day

294
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,583
Hold on

295
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,583
Just go

296
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:22,958
What are you doing?

297
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,708
I'm going with you

298
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,708
It's none of your business

299
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,208
I just want to figure out

300
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,458
what's the matter with Lin Xiangzhi

301
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,208
Your mom has

302
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:32,708
briefly told me

303
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,083
about your past

304
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,625
College Entrance Exam

305
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,250
is the one and only goal in the senior repeating class

306
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,750
Just tell me if you have any trouble

307
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,083
I'll definitely help you out

308
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,708
I just find it so weird

309
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,833
Last Friday

310
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,958
she tore up your letter

311
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:45,833
While this morning

312
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,791
she pretended that she didn't know you

313
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,333
Well, perhaps Lin Xiangzhi is just someone

314
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,458
who always keeps to herself

315
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,708
You're over reacting

316
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,708
Silence

317
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,208
A woman's intuition is always reliable

318
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,208
There must be something wrong

319
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,083
The two of you

320
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,833
will only click when you're gossiping

321
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:15,958
Song Xiaonan

322
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,708
Hey, she's over there

323
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:28,708
Silence

324
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:32,958
What should we do?

325
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:33,833
We've been spotted

326
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,333
There's nothing to worry about

327
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,333
You're just here to ask some questions

328
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,083
Hey, Lin Xiangzhi

329
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,083
Come on

330
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:38,583
Jiang Wu

331
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,333
wait for me Jiang Wu

332
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,125
Stop there Lin Xiangzhi

333
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:41,833
Wait a second Hey

334
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,333
Lin Xiangzhi, Please wait a second

335
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:49,625
This morning

336
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,208
why did you pretend

337
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,583
that you didn't know Xu Youshu?

338
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,583
Xu Youshu?

339
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,583
Who is he?

340
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,833
No way

341
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,208
We've been in the same class for a week

342
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,583
Last week

343
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,333
you even tore up a letter from me

344
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,333
What about me?

345
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,833
Do you remember who I am?

346
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,583
You're my desk mate

347
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,833
All of you are my classmates

348
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,333
But I really don't know

349
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,958
what you were talking about

350
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,458
That's impossible

351
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:20,958
Could it be that

352
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,208
I got you hit in the head?

353
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:23,958
What are you doing?

354
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,583
She's all right

355
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,583
Cut it out, Lin Xiangzhi

356
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:27,583
I'm not pretending

357
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,208
Then how could you forget that?

358
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,625
You wouldn't believe even if I tell you about it

359
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,875
I believe you

360
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,500
I do believe in you

361
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,375
I have this syndrome

362
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,250
a syndrome that makes me forget my friends

363
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,583
Because of it

364
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,625
my memory of my friends

365
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,375
only lasts for 7 days

366
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,375
What does that mean?

367
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,625
Are you saying that

368
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,250
you have amnesia?

369
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,458
To be exact

370
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,375
it's called a post-traumatic stress disorder

371
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,833
I once got hurt by accident

372
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,333
I stayed in hospital for a while

373
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,708
After I got well

374
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,083
I thought everything would be okay

375
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,333
But later I found that

376
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,625
I wouldn't remember all my friends every Monday

377
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,625
Neither could I recall the names and looks of my classmates

378
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,500
even for a newly met friend

379
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,000
I would also forget him or her on Mondays

380
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,583
The doctor said that something went wrong

381
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,750
with my short-term memory

382
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,208
I couldn't

383
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,208
even remember

384
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,500
what happened on the day of accident

385
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,083
After the treatment

386
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,458
the exact reason still couldn't be found

387
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,250
The doctor could only decide that

388
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,625
I suffered from PTSD

389
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,250
So there's no way

390
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,750
I could become friends with you

391
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,625
For as long as I get a memory of pleasure

392
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,625
anyone I want to be friends with

393
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,625
except my family

394
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,500
will be erased from my memory

395
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,875
each and every time Monday comes

396
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,083
All the memory about friends

397
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,750
will be gone altogether

398
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,500
Friends

399
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,625
Even so

400
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,250
that won't be a problem

401
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,500
Do you really buy her story?

402
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,458
She's got no reason to lie about this

403
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,208
That's right

404
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,375
Then how can you prove that you're not lying?

405
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,500
If you want me to prove it

406
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,750
this is the only thing I can show you

407
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,208
I'll never ask you to believe me

408
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,500
Because I can never make friends

409
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,875
in the first place

410
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,750
Making friends with me

411
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,291
will do you no good

412
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,625
You'll be forgotten

413
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:55,708
So could you please

414
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,250
stop approaching me in days to come

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,333
Lin Xiangzhi

416
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,125
let us share your sufferings

417
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,833
Even if your memory will only last for 7 days

418
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,875
that makes no difference

419
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,250
We can become one-week friends

420
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,500
Until you can truly remember us

421
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,375
Wait a minute

422
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,250
what do you mean by us?

423
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,625
Thank you for your kindness

424
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,583
But I transferred to this school

425
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,208
to prepare for the College Entrance Exam

426
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,208
I don't want any friends

427
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,708
Have you found that?

428
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,708
She actually wants to become friends with me

429
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,833
What

430
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,958
She just said that

431
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,333
she had forgotten everything about us in a week

432
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,708
But she would only forget friends

433
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,083
Friends

434
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,208
Don't you see that?

435
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:58,958
This means that

436
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,333
she started to regard us as friends last week

437
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,833
Lin

438
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,000
Lin

439
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,083
Here's your delivery

These

441
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,083
these are all good for the brain

442
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,208

See?

486
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,333
She wouldn't appreciate whatever you've done

487
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,166
Hi

488
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,083
Thank you

489
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,083
By the way

490
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,541
since that day

491
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,625
I've read a lot of books

492
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,708
about psychological traumas and memory

493
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,833
I have taken some notes

494
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,458
Wait a minute

495
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,750
Here's the notebook

496
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,458
At least you should accept this

497
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,750
It might help a bit

498
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,750
You can open it and have a look

499
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,541
I've copied what I've read

500
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,500
from the books on these post-it notes

501
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,375
and stuck them to this notebook

502
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,333
Take a look here

503
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,208
These are all about

504
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,916
how to improve memory

505
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,500
You can unfold it

506
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,708
And this part

507
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,458
you move it back and forth

508
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,458
These are some small games to relax yourself

509
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,583
and some exercises

510
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,625
As a matter of fact, you forgot me on Monday

511
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,083
It means that

512
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,583
you have already considered me as a friend

513
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,500
But I'll keep forgetting you

514
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,708
Then I'll try to find a way

515
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,250
to help you remember me every week

516
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,083
I've got an idea

517
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:21,833
Come on

518
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,833
Get on the bike

519
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:23,750
I'll take you to some place

520
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,125
Come on

521
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,375
Sit down

522
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,458
Trust me

523
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:35,125
Let's go

524
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:43,916
Here we are

525
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:50,458
Let's go

526
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,333
What's wrong?

527
00:24:59,208 --> 00:24:59,875
Why do you

528
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,208
have to be friends with me?

529
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,166
I'll tell you if you come in

530
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,000
Come on

531
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,500
My solution

532
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,750
is to keep a diary

533
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,708
As long as you write down

534
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,791
what you've done with friends in the diary

535
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,750
even if you forget your friend on Monday

536
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,375
you will remember everything that has happened

537
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,500
once you've seen the diary

538
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,958
But I, I just

539
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,833
You actually want to have friends, right?

540
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,208
I'll be your friend

541
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,333
Just give it a shot

542
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,375
Let's find a solution

543
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,541
to get over your illness

544
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:46,625
Choose one

545
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,708
Xu Youshu

546
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,625
If you really want to be my friend

547
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,208
Can you promise me something?

548
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,208
I promise

549
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,000
How can you make a promise

550
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,583
before I tell you what it is?

551
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:03,208
I'll promise you anyway

552
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,666
I want you to study hard

553
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,875
Do not give up on the exam

554
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,500
Okay

555
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,250
You can help me with my study

556
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,333
Is that all right?

557
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,375
Don't bargain over it

558
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,666
What color do you like?

559
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,458
-This one - This one

560
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,583
It's decided then

561
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:34,208
Let's go

562
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,125
Here we are

563
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,333
Where are we?

564
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,625
It's a deserted astronomy classroom of our school

565
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:48,375
It's been out of service for a long time

566
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,833
And I

567
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,166
as the most excellent student

568
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,083
in charge of sanitation of this school

569
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,375
was once designated to clean this place

570
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,333
Are you sure

571
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,125
there is such a title?

572
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,458
You can come here at noon breaks

573
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,833
Nobody's gonna bother you here

574
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,916
Welcome

575
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,458
to my secret base

576
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,250
What a huge telescope

577
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,708
It even spins

578
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:48,000
It has become our secret base

579
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,125
I can finally become a one-week friend

580
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:55,000
Just as I have promised

581
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,500
I keep working hard

582
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,625
But to my surprise

583
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,583
The required answer of this problem is

584
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,333
Youshu

585
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,625
Hi, Lin Xiangzhi

586
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,458
Song Xiaonan has joined us

587
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,333
Hi

588
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,833
Why did you bring everyone here?

589
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,208
What's the problem, Xu Youshu?

590
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,375
Is this supposed to be your property?

591
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,500
You promised not to quarrel

592
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,458
I just couldn't help it

593
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,583
All right

594
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,000
I'll count you in

595
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,583
Just for your sake

596
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,083
I never knew that

597
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,500
there would be such a great place in our school

598
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,458
How about coming here for shelter

599
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,750
on Dec21st this year

600
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,375
Shelter?

601
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:33,708
Are you so scared of death?

602
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,833
That's the end of the world

603
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:36,875
Of course I'm scared

604
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,083
I've never dated anyone

605
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,375
It won't come

606
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,250
The end of the world won't come

607
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,625
until the exam is over

608
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,125
How do you know that?

609
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,958
Because getting good grades means the day of rebirth

610
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,500
While repeating senior year again is the end of the world

611
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,458
Is that right, Lin Xiangzhi?

612
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,125
Then the end of Xu Youshu's world

613
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,583
is coming soon

614
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,500
As if you were not

615
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,625
going to meet your end

616
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,625
No matter what, I'm still an English class representative

617
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:56,083
Okay?

618
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,500
But I've got Xiangzhi's help, right?

619
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,833
Hey, what if the end of world won't come

620
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,208
just as Jiang Wu predicted?

621
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,791
We'll come here anyway

622
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,750
But for celebration instead of shelter

623
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,125
That's great

624
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,541
How's that, Xiangzhi?

625
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:10,958
Okay

626
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,125
Let's start to fix up this place

627
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:12,875
Let's go

628
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,333
Doomsday surviving squad

629
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah

630
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,458
Every Monday

631
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,708
We get acquainted with Lin Xiangzhi once again

632
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,208
Even though she will forget us every week

633
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,708
You have forgotten us again

634
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,125
But we can always find each other

635
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,125
in her diary book

636
00:29:58,958 --> 00:29:59,958
Hello

637
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,208
I am Xu Youshu

638
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,583
In that case, you won't forget me anymore

639
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,250
Xiangzhi

640
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,333
it's Monday again

641
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,250
Do you still remember us?

642
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:12,541
You've forgotten us again

643
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:13,125
Try to recall

644
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:13,958
I've heard that

645
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,875
a clear impression will help you get remembered

646
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:16,958
So he tries to get dressed

647
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,083
in an impressive way

648
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,708
Hey, that’s a bit too much

649
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,958
So you should solve this problem like that

650
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:31,958
I’ll mark

651
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,041
coordinate axis

652
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,583
Try to draw it yourself

653
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,083
Xu Youshu

654
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:45,833
Yep

655
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:47,958
Jiang Wu

656
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Song Xiaonan

657
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,750
x+y= 5

658
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,916
Song Xiaonan is equal to a pig

659
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,375
Xu Youshu

660
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,500
I’m gonna kill you

661
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:32,458
Come on

662
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,833
This is to celebrate the end of the mock

663
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,458
Cheers

664
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:40,458
Hey, help yourself

665
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,125
I’ve got a hunch

666
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,458
that I can definitely enter a good college this year

667
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,083
Of course

668
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:46,208
Which major would you like to choose

669
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,458
I prefer psychology

670
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:51,583
Psychology?

671
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,208
But you’re so good at math

672
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:54,708
It would be a pity

673
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,375
if you don’t choose a major

674
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,125
about investment analysis and finance

675
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,083
I became good at math

676
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,000
with the help of

677
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,833
a friend that I knew before

678
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,583
What about you, Jiang Wu?

679
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,583
What major will you choose?

680
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:07,958
I just want to study in Beijing

681
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,125
The major doesn’t matter

682
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:09,958
But why?

683
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,333
Because Jiang Wu’s parents

684
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,833
and sister work in Beijing

685
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,208
I’m a left-behind child

686
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,083
I just want to enter a college in Beijing

687
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:19,958
so that I can stay with them

688
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,208
How come you’ve never told me about that?

689
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,458
Because he doesn’t want to

690
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,208
Come on, Xu Youshu

691
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,083
Have some pig brains to make you smart

692
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,333
It’s good for your own brain

693
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,458
I appreciate that

694
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,708
What about you, Xiaonan?

695
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,708
I don’t care about the major either

696
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,500
Beijing is a nice choice

697
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,250
Wherever Jiang Wu goes, I’ll follow

698
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,208
Wherever Jiang Wu goes, I’ll follow

699
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,333
Okay

700
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,083
Let’s change the topic

701
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,958
That’s outrageous

702
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,208
How come nobody has asked me about my major?

703
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,583
Can you ever enter a college?

704
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,083
What are you talking about?

705
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,083
With Xiangzhi’s help

706
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,458
I can definitely rock the boat

707
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,208
Rock the boat?

708
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,458
That saying doesn’t work like that

709
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,208
Xiangzhi

710
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,208
Anyway his Chinese sucks

711
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,208
He sucks in all the other subjects

712
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,500
Shut up

713
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,083
Come on, help yourself

714
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,000
Thank you

715
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:37,041
So, is that supposed to be love at first sight?

716
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:37,958
I have this syndrome

717
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,041
that makes me forget my friends

718
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,833
How dare you throw a ball at me?

719
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,833
Xu Youshu, it’s you again!

720
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:01,833
How come

721
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,000
Why did no one wake me up?

722
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:12,583
♪See you in the secret base♪

723
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:31,541
What the hell is that?

724
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:33,500
Everything is so mysterious

725
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,291
What’s this about?

726
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,375
Where are you?

727
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,833
Happy birthday

728
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:00,833
Happy birthday to you

729
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,458
Happy birthday to you

730
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:04,000
Look here

731
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,333
Happy birthday to you

732
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:11,125
Happy birthday to you

733
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:13,833
Happy birthday

734
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,791
You have arranged everything here?

735
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,916
Thank you Thank you so much

736
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,041
You’re welcome

737
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,500
However

738
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,875
it’s not my birthday today

739
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,041
It’s just 3 days away

740
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,458
You will easily find out

741
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,458
if we do this prank on your birthday

742
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,333
Well, just make a wish first

743
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:35,666
Okay

744
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,083
Then I wish

745
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,333
everybody could get good grades in the exam

746
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,958
Well, that’s a pragmatic wish

747
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,666
My second wish is that

748
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:50,041
Xiangzhi could have a normal memory

749
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,750
You told me that getting acquainted with me every week

750
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:57,500
Would keep you refreshed, didn’t you?

751
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:58,583
That’s what dudes do

752
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:00,333
What did you say?

753
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,458
How dare you hit me?

754
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:02,416
Move on

755
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,541
My third wish is

756
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,458
Who’s up there

757
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:13,875
What are you doing?

758
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,458
Gosh

759
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,458
Run

760
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,125
We’ve been spotted

761
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:16,708
What are you doing?

762
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,208
I’ve enjoyed the cake with my eyes

763
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:24,083
I dropped my camera

764
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,250
Just leave it and run

765
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,375
Hey, the window over there

766
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,458
Who’s in the house?

767
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,333
Go Let’s hurry

768
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:35,500
Take care, Xiaonan

769
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,083
Hey, which class are you in?

770
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:39,333
Jiang Wu

771
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:40,250
We need to split up

772
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:40,666
Okay

773
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:41,041
Go

774
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:41,541
Stop

775
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:42,291
Meet you at the swimming pool

776
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:42,791
This way, Xiaonan

777
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:43,166
Hurry

778
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:46,208
Hurry

779
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:03,916
Ah

780
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:04,958
Wait a minute, Jiang Wu

781
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,083
I’ve got the key to the library

782
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,458
Stop there

783
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:09,291
It won’t open

784
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,166
You guys stop there

785
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,750
How come the door won’t open

786
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,250
You guys stop there

787
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,625
Open

788
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,083
Which class are you in?

789
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,000
Stop

790
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,625
You guys stop there

791
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,750
Don’t you try to hide

792
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,958
Where are you going?

793
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,625
We’ve got rid of him

794
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,583
The cake is still in the astronomy classroom

795
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:16,458
I’ll go and take it

796
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,583
Forget about it

797
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:21,666
I’ll send a message to them

798
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,750
You might get caught if you go out now

799
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,291
Where have the brats gone?

800
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,958
♪We’re waiting for you at the swimming pool♪

801
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,125
This is for you

802
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,750
I made it myself

803
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,125
Happy birthday

804
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,875
Do you want to have a taste?

805
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,958
Just see if it’s too sweet

806
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:23,625
Okay

807
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:30,333
It’s good

808
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:31,541
Delicious

809
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,958
We should be safe now

810
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,250
Could you please

811
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,458
stay with me for a longer while?

812
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:47,375
What?

813
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh

814
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,208
I mean

815
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,625
it’s still risky to get out now

816
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,625
We should hide for a longer while

817
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,333
Ah

818
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,458
Then we’ll stay for another while

819
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:13,916
Hey, hold it for me

820
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:18,708
What’s up?

821
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,416
You haven’t made the third wish

822
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,291
You’ll get unlucky

823
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,083
if you haven’t finished making that wish

824
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:36,958
All right

825
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:39,583
Make a wish now

826
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,583
Xu Youshu

827
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,875
My third wish

828
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,083
is just for you

829
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,333
Even though your memory only lasts a week

830
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,125
I ‘ll spend a lifetime

831
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:11,958
loving you

832
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,958
I will keep you company

833
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:16,500
until

834
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,291
until your illness is treated

835
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:26,375
In that case

836
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:29,583
you’ll never forget me anymore

837
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,000
Lin Xiangzhi

838
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:34,208
I love you

839
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,375
What’s wrong, Xiangzhi?

840
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:50,583
I’m sorry

841
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:52,833
Xiangzhi

842
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,583
Are you all right, Xiangzhi?

843
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:06,541
I have beaten up that fool for you

844
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:07,958
It’s okay now

845
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,583
Hey, Youshu

846
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,083
Xiangzhi

847
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:02,125
Xu Youshu

848
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:17,958
Lin Xiangzhi

849
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:21,208
have you read the diary?

850
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,208
What diary?

851
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:28,083
The diary book

852
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,583
It has a cover with round dots

853
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:33,208
There’s a picture of me in it

854
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:34,458
Youshu

855
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:35,708
Xiaonan

856
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:36,708
Jiang Wu

857
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:38,208
Jiang Wu

858
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:38,833
Come here

859
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:43,291
Oh, this one

860
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:46,708
What’s up?

861
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,208
You must remember this, right?

862
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,708
She doesn’t remember her diary

863
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,583
Hello, I am Xu Youshu

864
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:53,750
I don’t know what you’re talking about

865
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,875
Do I know you guys well?

866
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,708
Where’s your diary book?

867
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:01,708
All the people and things that matter to you

868
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,333
have been written in it

869
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,458
Wait a minute

870
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,333
What’s going on?

871
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:08,875
No, I don’t have it

872
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:09,333
That’s not right

873
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,875
- Hey, Youshu - What are you doing?

874
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:11,333
What are you doing?

875
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,083
What are you doing?

876
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,958
Why are you searching my schoolbag?

877
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:19,833
Xiangzhi

878
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:21,833
Try your best to recall

879
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,458
Did you leave your diary at home?

880
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,333
I don’t have a diary

881
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,833
What do you want from me?

882
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:33,958
Xiangzhi

883
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,708
No, I don’t have it

884
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:37,708
Please come with me

885
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,458
What are you doing?

886
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,250
Just come with me

887
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,458
Youshu

888
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:41,833
Let me go

889
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:42,500
What are you doing?

890
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:42,958
Let’s go and have a look

891
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:48,333
Youshu

892
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,083
Youshu, stop

893
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,333
You can never knock it open

894
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,083
We were in such a hurry yesterday

895
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,583
It must be

896
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:58,958
It must be left somewhere around here

897
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:02,458
Do you have a picture of us in your cellphone?

898
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:03,208
Yes

899
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:04,583
Take it out

900
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:05,708
Hurry

901
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:06,583
Just show her

902
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:08,458
Xiangzhi

903
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,708
Can you remember anything?

904
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,333
This picture means nothing

905
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,208
Does it show that we are close to each other?

906
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,333
I don’t know what you want from me

907
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:21,833
But I have to go back for class now

908
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,083
Wait a minute

909
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,333
Where are you going?

910
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,583
Where is it?

911
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:43,083
Astronomy classroom

912
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:44,708
Hallway

913
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:45,958
Swimming pool

914
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:47,708
Silence, everyone It’s time for class

915
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:49,833
Jiang Wu

916
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:51,083
Where is Xu Youshu?

917
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,083
On the way home

918
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,708
He’s not feeling well today, sir

919
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:57,333
Why is he always feeling unwell before class?

920
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:01,708
Hello

921
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:03,333
Have you seen a diary book?

922
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:03,708
No

923
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,458
I’m looking for a diary book

924
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:05,250
Have you seen one?

925
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,333
No, I haven’t

926
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:13,583
Jiang Wu

927
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:14,000
Look

928
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Xiangzhi

929
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:25,458
Xiangzhi

930
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:29,958
Do you remember me now?

931
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:44,083
I’ve found your phone number

932
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,458
But I haven’t found the diary yet

933
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:47,458
I’ll look for it somewhere else

934
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,333
Stop doing that

935
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,208
That diary is really important

936
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,083
It’s equal to your memory

937
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,583
I don’t need that memory

938
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:57,833
That’s because you don’t remember that

939
00:46:58,708 --> 00:46:59,458
We once

940
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,333
went to the astronomy classroom together

941
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:01,958
And you helped me with my study

942
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,208
Even if you’re telling the truth

943
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:04,958
Will that make any difference?

944
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,333
I don’t want to be bothered now

945
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,958
I can’t afford to waste any time

946
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,833
I can’t afford to fail College Entrance Exam again

947
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,583
If we just hang out together every day

948
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,708
and idle our time away

949
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,708
What are we going to do in the future?

950
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,208
Have you thought about that?

951
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,250
Is it because of your illness?

952
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,083
You’re afraid that you will forget your friends every week

953
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,708
If that’s the case

954
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,333
I’m not afraid that you would forget me

955
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,833
If you just want to study hard

956
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,208
then I won’t bother you

957
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:34,708
Because of you

958
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:37,083
I have started to work hard

959
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:38,458
I’ll try my best

960
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,083
to enter a college in the same city as you do

961
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,208
Even if I can’t

962
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,208
that won’t matter

963
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,583
I’ll find a way

964
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,958
to live near your college

965
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:49,583
In that way I can protect you all the time

966
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,833
Because you’re so important for me

967
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,708
But you’re not important for me

968
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:02,333
at all

969
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,208
You’re lying

970
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,083
That’s it

971
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:11,833
I don’t care about you

972
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:14,458
I don’t want to be your friend

973
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,333
I don’t want to do that even if I don’t have that illness

974
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,333
Do you understand?

975
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,333
Don’t flatter yourself

976
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:23,208
Xiangzhi

977
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,208
Youshu

978
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,583
You guys just stop getting close to me

979
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:33,208
Especially you, Xu Youshu

980
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:36,583
Especially you, Xu Youshu

981
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,458
Especially you, Xu Youshu

982
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:43,583
Xiangzhi

983
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:47,208
Especially you, Xu Youshu

984
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:52,083
Especially you, Xu Youshu

985
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:54,458
Especially you

986
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,000
Youshu

987
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:56,958
Xu Youshu

988
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:57,583
Xu Youshu

989
00:48:58,583 --> 00:48:59,333
Youshu

990
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:00,833
What’s wrong with you, Xu Youshu?

991
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:01,708
Youshu

992
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,333
I think he just broke down

993
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,833
because of some kind of stimulation

994
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:10,083
You don’t have to worry so much

995
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,000
He’ll stay in hospital for observation these days

996
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,000
All right

997
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:14,833
Okay

998
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,083
Thank you

999
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:16,958
Not at all

1000
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:23,833
Ma’am

1001
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,583
what’s the matter with Youshu?

1002
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,458
Nothing serious

1003
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,208
The doctor just said that

1004
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,208
he was just too tired

1005
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:35,083
He’s been working extra hard recently

1006
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,583
He needs to have a good rest

1007
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,833
and get enough sleep

1008
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:39,583
Thanks god he’s all right

1009
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,333
I was so worried

1010
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:42,083
It’s getting late

1011
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,083
You should get back and have some rest

1012
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:45,333
Okay

1013
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:46,208
Goodbye, Ma’am

1014
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:46,833
Goodbye

1015
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:47,583
Goodbye, Ma’am

1016
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:57,333
Let’s go

1017
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,583
Don’t disturb him

1018
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,208
Ma’am

1019
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,625
Youshu

1020
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:12,333
Does he get along with his classmates in school?

1021
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:14,333
He’s so nice to everyone

1022
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,458
And now he’s working hard, too

1023
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,833
So much the better

1024
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,833
That’s the right thing to do

1025
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,625
You must think the same, right?

1026
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:35,458
Actually Youshu is not silly at all

1027
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,458
He didn’t do well in College Entrance Exam last year

1028
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:40,250
So I let him transfer to another school

1029
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,208
in hopes of

1030
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,375
him living a safe and healthy life

1031
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,958
So that I can fulfill my goal

1032
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:51,625
His dad died young

1033
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,333
I know you’ve had a hard time

1034
00:50:59,333 --> 00:50:59,958
But do you think that

1035
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:00,875
Youshu doesn’t need to know

1036
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:02,333
these true facts?

1037
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:07,583
College Entrance Exam is coming soon

1038
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,833
And you’ll go your separate ways soon

1039
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,416
Do these facts

1040
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:14,583
really matter now?

1041
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:21,458
A lie is always a lie

1042
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:24,375
It cannot bring any good results

1043
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,000
I’m sorry, Youshu

1044
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,500
I lied to you

1045
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:31,083
I lied to Xiaonan

1046
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,500
I lied to Jiang Wu

1047
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,250
Someone like me

1048
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:39,583
does not deserve any friend

1049
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:48,833
During my first year of senior high school

1050
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:50,250
in Heping Senior High School

1051
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,708
I met my best friend

1052
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:55,708
Xu Jie

1053
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,208
Excuse me

1054
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:10,708
Hi

1055
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,958
Are you Xu Jie?

1056
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:18,833
Yeah

1057
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,583
We’re in the same class, right?

1058
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:21,208
Yeah

1059
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,083
Lin Xiangzhi

1060
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,083
Xiangzhi

1061
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,458
- You’re skipping the class - You’re skipping the class

1062
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:32,083
Mi la ti do do

1063
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:36,333
Are you all right?

1064
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:37,208
It was so close

1065
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:39,708
Who did that? That guy must suck in basketball

1066
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:52,708
Is this your ball?

1067
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:57,208
Yeah, are you all right?

1068
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:00,583
Okay

1069
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:02,458
Xu Youshu

1070
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:03,333
Where’s the ball?

1071
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,250
Hey, I’m coming

1072
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:06,625
Excuse me

1073
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:09,083
Here it is

1074
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:10,833
Hey, by the way

1075
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,708
We’re having a PE class, too

1076
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:13,583
Don’t worry

1077
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:14,583
I won’t tell on you

1078
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,875
And please don’t tell anyone

1079
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,458
that I broke the glass

1080
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,708
From that day on

1081
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,000
Xu Jie and I

1082
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,833
have become best friends

1083
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,500
Xu Jie always helped me; a good-time girl with math

1084
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,458
During the breaks

1085
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:37,208
we would buy stuff at the store

1086
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:39,375
We would have lunch together in the dining hall

1087
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:42,125
We were best friends

1088
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:47,375
How’s your math test

1089
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:48,083
No way

1090
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:48,958
You can’t have it

1091
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:50,375
Xiangzhi

1092
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:51,333
Hurry

1093
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:51,583
I’m coming

1094
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:52,916
I’ve found something wonderful

1095
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:55,708
A star necklace

1096
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:57,708
You like the stars?

1097
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:58,208
Yeah

1098
00:53:58,583 --> 00:53:58,958
Why?

1099
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,708
I once read a saying in a magazine

1100
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,000
The way to reach stars is extremely difficult

1101
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:06,875
But difficult roads always lead to a beautiful destination

1102
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:07,458
What about mine?

1103
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,083
We can wear it in turn

1104
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:09,708
Great

1105
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:10,791
Amazing

1106
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:11,958
The necklace of sisters

1107
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:12,958
Exactly the same

1108
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:15,708
Come on

1109
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,083
Pass it here

1110
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,208
Just pass him the ball

1111
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,833
To whom?

1112
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,083
When did you start to like him?

1113
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,958
The day we met in the storeroom

1114
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:39,208
You

1115
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:41,833
Jesus

1116
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:43,333
What are you gonna do?

1117
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:45,833
You’re always full of ideas

1118
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:48,333
Just do me a favor

1119
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:51,708
How can you just let me watch him at a distance?

1120
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,708
I’ve done some research

1121
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:58,791
He’ll definitely go past here on his way home

1122
00:54:58,791 --> 00:54:59,666
If a girl happens to

1123
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:01,000
have a flat tire

1124
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,083
when he goes past here

1125
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:03,333
What is he going to do?

1126
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,833
He might help me fix the tire

1127
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,708
Why didn’t you say fix your bike?

1128
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,458
He would definitely give you a ride

1129
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:14,833
Do you need help?

1130
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,333
I had a flat tire

1131
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:17,833
So I have to lock it here

1132
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,583
I’ll give you a ride

1133
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,458
let’s go

1134
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:27,583
Bye

1135
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:29,750
What a coincidence

1136
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,000
Hi

1137
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:31,916
Hi

1138
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:33,833
Thanks for helping me yesterday

1139
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:35,583
You’re welcome

1140
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:36,458
By the way

1141
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,333
have you got your bike fixed?

1142
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:39,666
Yes

1143
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,833
Why do you come for lunch so early today?

1144
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,958
You’ve made much progress

1145
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:48,708
Lin Xiangzhi

1146
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:49,708
Zip it

1147
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:50,708
Just enjoy your meal

1148
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:53,958
Cheers

1149
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,375
Since that day

1150
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:06,958
Xu Youshu

1151
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,833
came into our lives

1152
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,250
However

1153
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,583
I didn’t expect that

1154
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,208
our lives

1155
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,083
would have come to this point.

1156
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:49,458
Have you finished swapping your seats?

1157
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:51,583
Yes

1158
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,083
Let’s move on with our lessons

1159
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,208
She doesn’t have to do that

1160
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:08,083
even if she wants to study hard

1161
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,875
Hey, Xu Youshu

1162
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,250
I’m stuffed

1163
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:13,333
I’ve gotta go now

1164
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:15,333
Hey, Youshu

1165
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:19,625
On the day we looked for the diary

1166
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,208
I actually found Lin Xiangzhi was not quite herself

1167
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,583
Do you remember that

1168
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:25,833
when we were in hospital that day

1169
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,208
She stayed there after we left

1170
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:29,708
I tried to turn around and have a look

1171
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:30,583
But you stopped me

1172
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:36,666
Truth always hides beneath the surface

1173
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,083
Why did you text me

1174
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,333
to come here?

1175
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:10,708
Xiangzhi,

1176
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,333
you really don’t remember us?

1177
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:14,708
Why do you suddenly act like

1178
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,458
a totally different person?

1179
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:20,083
What do you want from me?

1180
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:21,833
Xiangzhi, answer me this

1181
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,458
Which high school did you go to

1182
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,833
before you transferred here?

1183
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:25,833
Heping Senior High School

1184
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,083
Do you know that Youshu was also a student there

1185
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:37,166
before he came here?

1186
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:42,291
You’ve known him for a long time

1187
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:44,083
And you aren’t sick

1188
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,208
You’ve been lying to us the whole time, right?

1189
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,083
I asked my friend in Heping Senior High School

1190
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:50,083
He knows about you two

1191
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,208
And he told me to stay away from you

1192
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:55,583
I don’t know what he meant by that

1193
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,875
Because I told you that

1194
00:58:58,875 --> 00:58:59,583
I was sick

1195
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:00,708
and I would forget my friends

1196
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:01,708
You aren’t sick

1197
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:02,708
I checked

1198
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:04,708
You don’t have the so-called amnesia

1199
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,583
We were fools for believing you so much,

1200
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:08,833
especially Youshu

1201
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:12,458
And what about Xu Jie?

1202
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:14,333
Why did you lie to us?

1203
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:32,333
Lin Xiangzhi,

1204
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:33,833
explain

1205
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:37,708
Lin Xiangzhi,

1206
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:40,458
explain now

1207
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:42,958
Why don’t you explain yourself?

1208
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:44,583
Sorry

1209
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,458
Sorry, I…

1210
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,208
I did lie to you

1211
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,583
Actually,

1212
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,958
I wanted to tell you the truth

1213
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,208
the day Youshu found the journal

1214
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:11,083
I wanted to tell you everything

1215
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:13,708
I’m sorry, please don’t look at me like that

1216
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:15,833
But…

1217
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,458
But the moment I saw Youshu on that day,

1218
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:19,958
when I looked him in the eyes

1219
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:22,333
I lost the nerve to tell the truth

1220
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:24,583
I’m sorry

1221
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,708
Because the one who really suffers from memory loss

1222
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:36,458
isn’t me

1223
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,208
It’s Youshu

1224
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:43,750
It all started

1225
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,833
on the day in our winter vacation of senior high

1226
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:50,791
The three of us went for a picnic by a lake in the suburbs

1227
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:53,708
Lin Xiangzhi

1228
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,333
Xu Youshu

1229
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:58,333
You, big fool

1230
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:06,708
Hey

1231
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,208
Hey

1232
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:13,708
What’s really going on in your mind?

1233
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,125
Tell me now

1234
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:19,250
I put the letter in the picnic basket

1235
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,958
That’s why we’re here on the boat now

1236
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,083
Now you get it

1237
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,250
I thought you were going to give it to him in person

1238
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:26,000
Xiangzhi,

1239
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,125
look at him , is he checking the picnic basket?

1240
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,208
Is he?

1241
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:31,250
Seems like it

1242
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,875
He seems to be looking at something

1243
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,833
Do you see?

1244
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,250
Is he holding something?

1245
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:37,458
Is it my picnic basket?

1246
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:38,083
Oh, be careful

1247
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:38,875
I can’t tell

1248
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,208
Me neither

1249
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,000
Xu Jie

1250
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:45,625
Xu Jie

1251
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:46,583
Give me your hand

1252
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,250
Xu Jie, grab my hand

1253
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:50,750
Xiangzhi

1254
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,458
Come on

1255
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,458
Grab my hand

1256
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:55,000
I can not swim

1257
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:56,416
Xu Jie

1258
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,000
Xu Jie

1259
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,458
Xu Youshu

1260
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:00,208
Help

1261
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:02,958
Xiangzhi

1262
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,333
Help

1263
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:11,958
Xu Youshu

1264
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:12,458
Help

1265
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:15,791
Xiangzhi

1266
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:16,875
Xu Jie

1267
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,083
Xiangzhi

1268
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:32,958
Xu Jie

1269
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:44,708
Grab it

1270
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:46,583
Xu Jie

1271
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:48,708
Xu Jie is still in the water

1272
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:02,625
Xu Jie

1273
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:05,083
Xu Jie is still in the water

1274
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,708
She’s still down there

1275
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,208
Wait here for me

1276
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:15,625
Help

1277
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:18,458
Help

1278
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,750
Can anyone hear me? Help!

1279
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:24,958
Youshu

1280
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:27,416
Xu Jie

1281
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:30,083
Help

1282
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,333
Youshu

1283
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,333
Xu Jie

1284
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,208
Help

1285
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,458
Help

1286
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,083
Help

1287
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:55,833
Help! Can anyone hear me?

1288
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,583
Help!

1289
01:04:57,958 --> 01:05:01,875
Anyone? Help!

1290
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,166
Stop crying

1291
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:42,458
Give my sister back

1292
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:44,083
You know she can’t swim

1293
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,458
Why did you take her boating?

1294
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:47,833
Why aren’t you dead?

1295
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:49,708
It should be you

1296
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:51,750
Why?

1297
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:54,625
Get out

1298
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,083
Get out I don’t want to see you

1299
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,000
Get out

1300
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,375
Are you?

1301
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:13,083
Are you going to express your love?

1302
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:14,375
Yeah

1303
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,958
I’m working on it

1304
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:39,458
Doctor

1305
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,583
Why is my son still in a coma?

1306
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,083
Is he gonna be alright?

1307
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:44,958
Yaoyao

1308
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:45,458
Yeah?

1309
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:46,833
We shouldn’t talk to her anymore

1310
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:47,875
She’s bad luck

1311
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,958
So far,

1312
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,708
he’s been in a coma

1313
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,000
But the injury on his head

1314
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:54,458
isn’t serious

1315
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:56,583
That’s the silver lining

1316
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:57,583
I see

1317
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:00,625
Thank you

1318
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,583
Who did this?

1319
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:13,500
No idea

1320
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,708
Maybe Xu Jie

1321
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,666
It’s not okay to bully your classmates

1322
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,500
We taught you better than this

1323
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:20,583
I don’t want to see this happen again

1324
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:21,750
Yes, ma’am

1325
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:25,375
And I know what you did to Xiangzhi

1326
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,416
You guys,

1327
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:27,750
come to my office after class

1328
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:46,958
Xiangzhi

1329
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:49,083
Xu Youshu is awake

1330
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,958
Youshu

1331
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,083
Youshu

1332
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,458
How are you feeling?

1333
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:41,541
I brought you some fruits and orange juice

1334
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,708
What’s wrong?

1335
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,458
Are you okay? Should I get the doctor?

1336
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,375
Who are you?

1337
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,875
I’m Lin Xiangzhi

1338
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:01,750
And who’s that?

1339
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:05,333
Cognitive confusion?

1340
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:07,083
It’s also called PTSD

1341
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:08,458
He may not be able

1342
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:09,708
to accept what happened

1343
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,583
It was too much for him

1344
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,833
So, he developed a sense of self-protection

1345
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,000
And that

1346
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,500
is the cause of cognitive confusion

1347
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,333
He erased everything and everyone related to the accident

1348
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:20,958
from his memory

1349
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,375
Besides, he was deprived of oxygen

1350
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:23,333
for a long time in the water

1351
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,958
It’s possible that he suffers from a temporary memory loss

1352
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:26,708
I’m his mother

1353
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,833
I need to protect my son

1354
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:30,583
I’m begging you

1355
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,500
Please don’t come to see him again

1356
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:35,208
Please don’t let him see you again

1357
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,958
I know it’s not fair to you

1358
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:41,125
But you also hope that

1359
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:44,166
Youshu could have a happy life

1360
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,083
Don’t you?

1361
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:51,958
I see

1362
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:58,000
No

1363
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,458
I am not

1364
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:02,208
Lin Xiangzhi

1365
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:03,208
You’re so lucky

1366
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:10,708
I am not

1367
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,708
I am not

1368
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,083
I am not

1369
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:17,125
I am not

1370
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,583
I am not

1371
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:20,625
I am not

1372
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:22,791
I am not

1373
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:25,125
I am not

1374
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:27,458
Mom

1375
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:42,666
I miss Xu Jie so much

1376
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,750
Xiangzhi

1377
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,666
From now on

1378
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:47,958
you can try to keep a journal

1379
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:51,875
It can help you relax

1380
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:55,583
It’s like talking to a hole in a tree

1381
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:58,708
You can write anything in your journal

1382
01:10:58,708 --> 01:10:59,958
The good and the bad

1383
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:00,958
Your stress

1384
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,833
will ease

1385
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:04,958
In that case,

1386
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,083
your condition will be improved

1387
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:07,708
I’ve explained the answers to these questions

1388
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:09,583
many times in class

1389
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:11,708
With your current grades,

1390
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:13,083
how could you get into college?

1391
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:14,708
Xiangzhi,

1392
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,708
studying is your top priority

1393
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:19,041
You need to perform as you used to

1394
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:20,458
and get into a nice school

1395
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,583
So that you won’t fail your parents

1396
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:23,875
and your friends

1397
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:24,458
Understand?

1398
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:27,500
I don’t blame you

1399
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:28,958
for failing in the exam

1400
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:32,000
I don’t think your current school suits you

1401
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:34,208
I’ve asked your aunt

1402
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,083
She said she had an empty room at her place

1403
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:36,958
I’m wondering

1404
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,958
if I should transfer you

1405
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:42,458
You may be able to

1406
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,166
concentrate on preparing for the next College Entrance Exam

1407
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,583
over there

1408
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,041
Xiangzhi,

1409
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:57,791
you can use this room

1410
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:59,500
It used to be a storeroom

1411
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,500
But I cleaned it up

1412
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,500
It should it okay now

1413
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:03,750
I’ll leave you to unpack

1414
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:05,000
Come down for dinner later

1415
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:17,083
The first day I was in Shenghua Senior High School,

1416
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,208
the moment I walked into the class,

1417
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:21,958
I saw my most familiar

1418
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:23,833
and strangest friend

1419
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:26,958
Is this a joke?

1420
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,083
I had to pretend not to know him

1421
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,125
Hello, everyone

1422
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:32,583
I’m Lin Xiangzhi

1423
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:33,958
He

1424
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,083
didn’t seem to recognize me

1425
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:38,833
Looks like he still suffers from memory loss

1426
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,458
Can I transfer again?

1427
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:42,958
Now

1428
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,333
what should I do

1429
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,208
to get through the rest of the days?

1430
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:45,875
Lin Xiangzhi,

1431
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:47,500
please read this letter

1432
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,333
I want to be your friend

1433
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:53,125
I truly hated myself at that moment

1434
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:54,833
Xu Jie should be the one

1435
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:55,958
receiving that letter

1436
01:12:56,708 --> 01:12:58,708
I don’t deserve to be Youshu’s friend

1437
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,458
I don’t even deserve to

1438
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:02,958
have friends

1439
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,625
It was like my fate was taunting me

1440
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:07,500
In the heat of that moment,

1441
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,833
I had to pretend not to know Xu Youshu

1442
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:13,083
I had to pretend to have amnesia to escape from reality

1443
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:14,708
Who are you?

1444
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:16,083
However,

1445
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:17,791
once you told a lie,

1446
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,750
you need to cover it with more lies

1447
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:22,500
So, I thought of that

1448
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:24,208
fishes only have seven seconds of memories

1449
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,041
I have a condition

1450
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:27,458
that I forget about my friends

1451
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:29,625
I can only remember

1452
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:32,208
my friends for seven days

1453
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:34,583
because of my condition

1454
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,583
As long as my memory only lasts for a week,

1455
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:39,125
we can’t be friends

1456
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,958
That was the best for both of us

1457
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:45,208
But Youshu refused to give up

1458
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:47,083
He did everything he could

1459
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:48,833
trying to help me with

1460
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:51,583
this fake disease

1461
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,958
I couldn’t cross the line

1462
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,625
Why did I survive

1463
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:00,375
instead of Xu Jie,

1464
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,083
the one he was supposed to love?

1465
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:06,708
I decided to hide my journal

1466
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:08,333
Cross out everything

1467
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:10,833
It may be the best

1468
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:12,458
Back to the beginning

1469
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,375
when we were strangers

1470
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:16,583
As if

1471
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:19,750
we never met

1472
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,458
I don’t care about you

1473
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,583
I don’t want to be your friend

1474
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,708
I wouldn’t be your friend even if I weren’t sick

1475
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,583
Don’t flatter yourself

1476
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:30,958
If you really understand,

1477
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,708
I’m begging you again

1478
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,458
I’ll take this as a coincidence

1479
01:14:37,208 --> 01:14:38,750
I know it’s hard for you too

1480
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:41,375
But it’ll only make

1481
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:42,958
Youshu more miserable,

1482
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:44,333
if he remembers

1483
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:49,083
I just want this nightmare

1484
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:50,583
to end as soon as possible

1485
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:53,208
Okay?

1486
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:56,958
I know you won’t forgive me

1487
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:03,083
I won’t forgive myself either

1488
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:09,333
But I’m begging you

1489
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,458
Please don’t let Youshu

1490
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:12,458
go through that again

1491
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:15,583
Just give me some time

1492
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,333
I’ll make myself disappear

1493
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,208
right after the exam

1494
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:20,958
I promise

1495
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:27,875
Xiangzhi,

1496
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:30,208
I don’t know Xu Jie

1497
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:33,208
But you need to know that

1498
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,833
none of this is your fault

1499
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:03,333
Youshu,

1500
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,125
let’s go

1501
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,291
Where are you going?

1502
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:12,708
It’s that way

1503
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,250
Don’t we have plans today?

1504
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,166
She doesn’t recognize us

1505
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:19,458
Don’t do this to yourself

1506
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:24,666
Let’s go

1507
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:25,583
Let’s go

1508
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,208
Song Xiaonan

1509
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,083
Do you believe in the end of the world?

1510
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,458
Shh, stop talking

1511
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:39,208
10 seconds

1512
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,583
until Dec 22nd

1513
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:45,333
Five

1514
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:46,666
Four

1515
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:48,291
Three

1516
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:49,666
Two

1517
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:50,958
One

1518
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:03,583
It’s midnight

1519
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:26,958
We aren’t dead

1520
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:28,458
See

1521
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:29,958
I told you nothing’s gonna happen

1522
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,083
Do you think

1523
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:37,833
Xiangzhi remembers our plan for today?

1524
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,833
Mind your own business

1525
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:43,208
The exam is less than six months away

1526
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,083
I agree with Lin Xiangzhi

1527
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:47,833
We should all mind our own business

1528
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,833
Here’s for us

1529
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,208
surviving the end of the world

1530
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:55,458
Yay!

1531
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:57,208
Cheers

1532
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:04,708
My son

1533
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:07,833
Oh, my son

1534
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,333
You did great, my son

1535
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,500
It’s finally over

1536
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,666
Xiaonan

1537
01:19:16,416 --> 01:19:17,041
Look

1538
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,458
This is for you

1539
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:19,125
Wu

1540
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:22,125
Hey, sister

1541
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,333
How’s your exam?

1542
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:26,208
Fine

1543
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,500
How do you want to celebrate tonight?

1544
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:29,875
Anything will do

1545
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,500
Let’s go

1546
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,875
Let me buy you a gift

1547
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:45,458
How’s your exam?

1548
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:46,500
It’s not so hard this year

1549
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,500
I did alright

1550
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,750
But I still can’t get my mind around it

1551
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,208
Xiaonan,

1552
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,500
have you decided which city you want to go to?

1553
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:02,916
You want me to go to Beijing, right?

1554
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:06,750
I saw Dai

1555
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,875
expressing his love to you that afternoon

1556
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:10,625
Y-

1557
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,708
You saw that?

1558
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:18,875
Actually

1559
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,625
I don’t care what you said to him

1560
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,500
I just want to tell you that,

1561
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:26,833
Xiaonan,

1562
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:29,833
I love you

1563
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,000
We haven’t seen each other for days

1564
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:41,083
And I’ve been thinking about you

1565
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:43,875
I felt so sad

1566
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,208
seeing another man confessing to you

1567
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:47,250
I guess

1568
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:47,958
this is

1569
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:49,333
how you feel when you love someone

1570
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:51,000
So, I want to ask you

1571
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:53,875
Will you be my girlfriend?

1572
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,375
How could you say you love me in a skewer restaurant?

1573
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,125
It’s so not romantic

1574
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:15,083
Why didn’t you say something earlier?

1575
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:16,083
I’ve decided

1576
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:17,083
to go to Australia

1577
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:22,750
That’s fine

1578
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:25,333
It’s good

1579
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:26,958
It’ll be good for you

1580
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:29,083
to see the world

1581
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:30,625
You just said you loved me

1582
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:32,083
And now you’re saying goodbye?

1583
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:32,833
No, no

1584
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,250
I’ll be waiting for you

1585
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:37,208
Really?

1586
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:37,958
We can call, text and video chat with

1587
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:39,208
each other

1588
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,250
every day

1589
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,833
I also can visit you during holidays

1590
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:44,500
Because I know that

1591
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,458
my love for you

1592
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:49,583
will never change even we’re apart

1593
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:55,208
Okay

1594
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,208
How’s your exam?

1595
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:00,708
Fine

1596
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:01,458
If I can’t get into a second-tier one

1597
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:02,833
I should at least get into a third- tier college

1598
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:03,333
Not bad

1599
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:05,541
How about you?

1600
01:22:06,041 --> 01:22:06,541
Me?

1601
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:08,333
I should be able to get into a college in Beijing

1602
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:15,416
What’s wrong?

1603
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:17,708
It should be okay

1604
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:21,583
if I go see Xiangzhi now, right?

1605
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:23,708
Youshu

1606
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,625
Can you really explain

1607
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,541
love?

1608
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:35,791
I’ve made up my mind

1609
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:37,041
I’ll go see her

1610
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:38,583
tomorrow

1611
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,750
I want to ask her

1612
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,083
which school she’s going to apply

1613
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,833
Then I’ll apply to a school in the same city

1614
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,458
But she doesn’t recognize me now

1615
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,458
So, I want you to go with me

1616
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,541
It’s more convincing

1617
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:56,250
Youshu

1618
01:22:57,291 --> 01:22:58,583
I can go with you

1619
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,708
But have you thought about it?

1620
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:02,458
When you go to college,

1621
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:03,583
you’ll be in another city

1622
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:04,833
and meet more people

1623
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:06,083
There’ll be more opportunities

1624
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:07,958
Besides, she says she forgets about you every seven days

1625
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,833
Do you truly want that for your life?

1626
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,458
But there’s only one

1627
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:13,666
Lin Xiangzhi

1628
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:16,958
If you value me as your friend

1629
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:18,708
Don’t see her again

1630
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:21,125
Hey

1631
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:22,000
Hey

1632
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:26,625
What do you mean?

1633
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,625
Going to see her is a waste of your time

1634
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:30,708
I dare you to say that again

1635
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,208
You despise her because of her illness

1636
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,333
I don’t

1637
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,833
I’m telling you everything she said was a lie

1638
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:37,250
Shut up

1639
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:40,208
Hitting me won’t make a difference

1640
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:41,583
There’s no cure for her disease

1641
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:42,958
That’s my business I want to heal her

1642
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:43,708
Don’t you get it?

1643
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:45,791
There’s no cure

1644
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:51,500
Youshu

1645
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:53,333
Xu Jie

1646
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:54,625
Youshu

1647
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,416
Youshu

1648
01:23:58,333 --> 01:23:59,500
Xu Jie

1649
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:02,583
Youshu

1650
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:03,958
Xu Jie

1651
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:29,583
Youshu

1652
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,125
Who’s Xu Jie?

1653
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,333
You remembered

1654
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:51,583
Give me your phone

1655
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:52,833
Give it to me

1656
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:54,208
Youshu, calm down

1657
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:57,833
Youshu

1658
01:24:58,083 --> 01:25:00,333
I have something important to tell her

1659
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:01,500
Lin Xiangzhi said

1660
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:04,083
she would leave for your sake after the exam

1661
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:06,625
and she didn’t want you to get hurt again

1662
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,708
Hello

1663
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:14,208
Is this Lin Xiangzhi’s residence?

1664
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,125
She left

1665
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,125
to the station

1666
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:31,208
I’m happy I got to see Youshu again

1667
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,083
and to know Xiaonan and Jiang Wu

1668
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:37,208
I thought I would face it alone

1669
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:40,375
I didn’t expect you to accept me

1670
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:44,583
I didn’t explain myself in senior one

1671
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:47,333
But misunderstanding increased as rumors spread

1672
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:48,916
I don’t want Youshu

1673
01:25:48,916 --> 01:25:50,708
to relive the pain of losing a friend

1674
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:54,208
So, I left after the exam

1675
01:25:58,708 --> 01:25:59,708
I snapped my phone card

1676
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,958
and cut myself off from everyone

1677
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,500
It’s enough to

1678
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,583
have met you

1679
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:18,250
Xu Jie

1680
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:20,958
You once told me

1681
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:23,708
it’s hard

1682
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:24,958
to get to the stars

1683
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:28,458
Are you

1684
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:31,125
there yet?

1685
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:33,083
Wait

1686
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:33,833
Slow down

1687
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:34,583
Slow down ,wait for me

1688
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:35,208
Come on

1689
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:37,375
Let’s take a photo

1690
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:38,583
Three

1691
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:39,458
Two

1692
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:39,833
One

1693
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:43,083
Come on

1694
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:44,583
Look

1695
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:46,083
So beautiful

1696
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:49,958
Delete it Delete it now

1697
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:52,083
No way I won’t

1698
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:08,875
Coming

1699
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Mrs Xu

1700
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Jiang Wu

1701
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:21,583
Youshu

1702
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:24,083
It’s me

1703
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:25,583
Open the door

1704
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,375
I’m here to return your PSP

1705
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,208
I’ll take it with me if you don’t open the door

1706
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:40,333
Youshu

1707
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:43,958
Why do you avoid me?

1708
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:48,291
I know you blame me for hiding the truth from you

1709
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:51,041
But do you know the real truth?

1710
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:54,708
The real truth is that we care about you

1711
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,333
We didn’t want to disturb you

1712
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,583
for the sake of the exam

1713
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:01,583
The planetarium will be torn down

1714
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:03,125
in a while

1715
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,125
Xiaonan and I cleaned things up

1716
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,625
I brought you this

1717
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,250

Xu Youshu

1724
01:29:12,208 --> 01:29:13,208
You are?

1725
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:16,583
Xu Jie’s brother

1726
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:19,208
Sorry,

1727
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:20,083
ma’am

1728
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,875
It took me so long to visit you

1729
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,083
I found this

1730
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:30,208
when I cleaned my sister’s room

1731
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:34,000
It’s filled with all of your photos

1732
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:46,791
There’s a letter in it that Jie wrote to you

1733
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:48,791
I read it

1734
01:29:49,916 --> 01:29:52,250
I believe it was an accident

1735
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,375
These memories belong to you

1736
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:04,833
Take it with you

1737
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:07,958
Thank you, ma’am

1738
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:11,250
I’ll cherish it

1739
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:17,875
Wait

1740
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:24,875
Stay for lunch, will you?

1741
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,625
No one wants to see that accident

1742
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:49,833
I think

1743
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:52,500
no one

1744
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:55,208
in my family

1745
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:58,208
is willing to

1746
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,500
accept the devastating fact

1747
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,833
that Jie is gone

1748
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:07,333
But if your life

1749
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,458
gets stuck

1750
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,750
because of it,

1751
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,625
it will only

1752
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,208
make you and us

1753
01:31:18,583 --> 01:31:19,833
live in pain

1754
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:31,208
Lin Xiangzhi

1755
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:32,708
has come many times

1756
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:34,250
But she never got the courage to come in

1757
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:40,375
You two

1758
01:31:42,083 --> 01:31:43,875
must take care of yourselves

1759
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,250
Coming

1760
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:12,250
Hello

1761
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,458
A package for Lin Xiangzhi

1762
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:38,625
Xiangzhi

1763
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,458
Lately,

1764
01:32:41,458 --> 01:32:42,958
I haven’t been able to reach you

1765
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:44,958
So, I didn’t dare to go see you

1766
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:47,458
I was afraid you wouldn’t see me

1767
01:32:48,458 --> 01:32:50,083
This was Jiang Wu’s bad idea

1768
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:51,875
He told me to write you a journal

1769
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,958
He asked me to write about

1770
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:56,500
every day since I met you

1771
01:32:57,083 --> 01:33:00,583
It also could make up for the days that I lost my memory

1772
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:03,000
Don’t mind

1773
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,208
my poor handwriting

1774
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,833
♪Thank you for being tough enough♪

1776
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,083
I know

1777
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,083
I wasn’t brave enough

1778
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:19,708
to tell you how I feel about you

1779
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:22,083
which caused misunderstanding among us

1780
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:26,833
I always notice you in the crowd

1781
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:30,083
But I always miss my chances

1782
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:32,583
of expressing my feeling to you

1783
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:37,333
Where’s the girl

1784
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:38,958
who’s always with you?

1785
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:41,583
She’s on duty today

1786
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,875
Are you in the same class?

1787
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:46,250
Yeah, Class Six

1788
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:48,583
What’s her name?

1789
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:49,833
Lin Xiangzhi

1790
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,083
She’s my best friend

1791
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:53,416
Lin Xiangzhi

1792
01:33:54,833 --> 01:33:56,041
After graduation,

1793
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:57,458
I went to see Xu Jie

1794
01:33:58,541 --> 01:34:00,041
and her family

1795
01:34:00,916 --> 01:34:02,583
I got the letter she wrote to me

1796
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:04,916
I put the letter in the picnic basket

1797
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:07,250
♪Despite everything I’ve lost♪

1798
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,708
♪At least we can be♪

1799
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:10,416
Is he holding something?

1800
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:12,458
Xu Jie

1801
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:14,083
Xu Youshu

1802
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:14,500
Xiangzhi

1803
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:15,333
Oh

1804
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:17,833
Lin Xiangzhi

1805
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:18,625
Xu Jie

1806
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:19,833
She wrote about

1807
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:22,333
things she wanted to do after graduation

1808
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:24,875
She wanted to shoot off fireworks with us

1809
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:27,208
in the last summer of our high school

1810
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:28,958
See the snow with us in winter

1811
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:30,833
Get drunk with us

1812
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:34,250
Travel different countries with us

1813
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:35,583
However,

1814
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:38,000
I know we need time to recover

1815
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:41,166
So, I decided to leave you alone this time

1816
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,958
Until

1817
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:44,416
you’re willing to admit that we’re friends

1818
01:34:45,333 --> 01:34:47,166
In that case, you won’t feel pressure

1819
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:50,375
Finally, I put Xu Jie’s necklace in the package

1820
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,166
I know it’s important to you

1821
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,250
Sir,

1822
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,333
please speed up

1823
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:04,583

1824
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:06,708
Xiangzhi

1825
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:08,500
Sorry, Mrs Xu

1826
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:10,875
I know I shouldn’t be here

1827
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,375
But I

1828
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,916
really have something important

1829
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:17,125
to tell Youshu

1830
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:18,958
Could you let me see him?

1831
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:20,250
He’s not at home

1832
01:35:21,291 --> 01:35:22,666
When he left,

1833
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:23,916
he mumbled something about

1834
01:35:23,916 --> 01:35:24,875
the planetarium

1835
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:27,166

I’m Xu Youshu

1861
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:31,125
Sorry, I-

1862
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:34,208
I kept it from you

1863
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:36,375
I need to thank you

1864
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:40,250
Thank you for being there for me

1865
01:37:53,208 --> 01:37:54,375
Thank you

1866
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,333
for sending me this necklace

1867
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:06,708
I’ll wear it

1868
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,833
to experience things Xu Jie never got to,

1869
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:13,000
to those countries she’s never been to,

1870
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:15,625
to see the snow she never saw,

1871
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:17,000
and to shoot off fireworks she never did

1872
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:20,958
I’ll wear it to complete

1873
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:22,333
those things she didn’t

1874
01:38:22,333 --> 01:38:23,625
get to do

1875
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:26,833
Xiangzhi,

1876
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:29,333
not all wounds

1877
01:38:30,083 --> 01:38:31,583
can be healed

1878
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:34,291
But we can face it together

1879
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:35,708
This time

1880
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:38,125
let me be there for you

1881
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,500
I strung our necklaces together

1882
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:10,000
Xu Jie,

1883
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,250
let’s start our lives

1884
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,083
with fireworks

1885
01:39:13,083 --> 01:39:13,875
Now this is the proper celebration

1886
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:16,583
for surviving the end of the world

1887
01:39:16,875 --> 01:39:17,833
Do you think

1888
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,083
an even bigger disaster

1889
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:20,583
will happen to us?

1890
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,208
There’s nothing to be afraid of

1891
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:23,916
The stars always shine in the darkness

1892
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,291
As long as we’re brave,

1893
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:26,708
we’ll always find the silver lining

1894
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:29,208
So, if there is a bigger disaster,

1895
01:39:29,208 --> 01:39:30,500
we’ll overcome it

1896
01:39:30,791 --> 01:39:31,958
Just like what

1897
01:39:31,958 --> 01:39:33,208
Song Xiaonan did to you

1898
01:39:33,583 --> 01:39:34,458
Xu Youshu

1899
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:36,791
Right on

1900
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:46,041
Thank you, guys

1901
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,208
For what?

1902
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:52,958
For being my one week friends

1903
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:57,375
You’re welcome

1904
01:40:00,458 --> 01:40:03,708
Our memories are about our past

1905
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:06,125
but they also make us who we are

1906
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:10,083
We grow up with the pain in our lives

1907
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:12,250
and give certain meaning to it

1908
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:15,458
I believe you also

1909
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:17,458
watched the fireworks in some place

1910
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:20,583
I’ll always miss you

1911
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,083
The fireworks burst only for a moment

1912
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:25,625
But our friendship lasts forever

1913
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:27,833
Thank you for

1914
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:29,500
understanding who I was,

1915
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:31,458
believing in who I’ll be,

1916
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:32,583
and

1917
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:34,958
accepting who I am

1918
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:36,708
We’ll always be

1919
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:39,375
one week friends

1920
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:41,625
Doomsday surviving squad

1921
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:45,500
Yay!
