Your wife and daughter are in my hands.

This is your last chance
to beg for mercy.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,920
You scoundrel.

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,680
I hope you die horribly.

your wife and daughter

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,319
will have a bone broken.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,439
Lord Pingnan.

33
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,480
It was Lord Pingnan who sent me.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
He said you're an ambitious official

35
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,799
wielding too much power,

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,680
and one day, you'll threaten...

37
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,800
Noisy.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,319
My Lord.

39
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,319
Write in the document.

40
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,280
This man was a mere rogue,

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,520
a killer for profit,
who took his own life.

42
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,280
Yes.

43
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,110
Young Master, something's wrong!

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,230
There's a fire in the manor!
Miss Shen is in trouble!

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
Fire!

46
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,620
- There's a fire!
- Get water!

47
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,199
Miss Shen won't choke in there, right?

48
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,060
Putting out the fire is more urgent.
Why worry about that unfavored girl?

49
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,280
Let's go.

50
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,560
Shen Qingtang!

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,360
Qingtang.

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,840
Qingtang.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,280
Qingtang.

54
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,280
Qingtang.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,479
Miss!

56
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,400
Miss.

57
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,599
What happened here?

58
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,280
I accidentally knocked over

59
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,159
the storeroom candle.

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,080
It was Xinglu.

61
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm sure of it.

62
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,960
Xinglu locked Miss Qingtang
in the storeroom

63
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,230
and deliberately set the fire.

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,159
Stop slandering me!

65
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,520
I saw it too. It was Miss Xinglu!

66
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,280
Today I was on duty,

67
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,380
and when I passed the storeroom,

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,879
I saw Miss Qingtang being pushed inside.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,599
Xinglu was pressing hard against the door,
not letting her out.

70
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,000
Soon after,

71
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,080
the storeroom suddenly caught fire.

72
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,120
It wasn't me!

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,719
She locked herself in there!

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,560
I didn't!

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,199
Miss Qingtang isn't foolish.

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
How could she lock herself in?

77
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,840
It must be due to the recent rumors

78
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,879
about her being married off
to the West Courtyard.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
Xinglu bore a grudge

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,890
and set the fire on purpose.

81
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,360
Madam Pei, Eldest Young Master,

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,480
please bring justice for her!

83
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,079
Madam Pei.

84
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,519
You've all been deceived by her.

85
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,680
She uses that innocent, fragile face

86
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,600
to fool everyone.

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,920
She...she's a lunatic!

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,000
She'll bring disaster to the Pei family!

89
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,680
Seems some maid

90
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
doesn't value her life.

91
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,399
Spreading such groundless rumors

92
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,399
and making

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,279
reckless accusations.

94
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,040
Such people mustn't be kept.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,780
Beat her to death.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,639
Wait.

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
Xinglu is carrying my child.

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,279
Grandmother.

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,879
This is a minor matter,

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,759
not worth a life.

101
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,560
Shen Qingtang was brought into
the Pei family by me.

102
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,199
She's the rightful and legitimate
young lady of the Pei family.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,399
She's mine.

104
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,439
If anyone dares to plot against her

105
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,240
while I'm away,

106
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
you all know the consequences.

107
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,319
Luckily, nothing serious happened today.

108
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,839
Take Qingtang to treat her injuries.

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,160
This matter has its reasons

110
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,639
and isn't yet resolved.

111
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,480
Take Pei Jingming and his maid

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,290
to the ancestral hall
to kneel in punishment.

113
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,279
Without my permission,

114
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
they aren't to step out.

115
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:42,839
Yes.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,720
This burn looks awful.

117
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,879
I wonder if it'll leave a scar.

118
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,560
Miss,

119
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,720
I already moved the wine jars.

120
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,560
How did the fire still get so big?

121
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,759
I burned myself.

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,040
If I'm going to set the stage,
I have to go all in.

123
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,720
The bigger the fire,

124
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,560
the more people will see

125
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,759
how vicious and scheming

126
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,079
Xinglu is.

127
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,720
Only then will Madam Pei be wary

128
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,759
of Pei Jingming's marriage

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,040
and stop pressuring me for now.

130
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,399
Madam Pei,

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,890
Second Young Master
has been kneeling all night.

132
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,600
Eldest Young Master hasn't spoken.

133
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,079
It's all that maid Xinglu's fault.

134
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,600
Before, even if he favored Miss Shen,

135
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,680
he wouldn't openly defy you.

136
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,879
Now that this has happened,

137
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,639
it'll cause gossip.

138
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,680
I didn't expect Congzhi

139
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,279
to indulge an adopted sister like this.

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,480
Miss Shen has always been cautious.

141
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,600
But if she becomes too arrogant
with his favor,

142
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,360
she'll be harder to use in the future.

143
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,360
Does it still hurt?

144
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,680
I'm fine.

145
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,360
Let me see.

146
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
Really, I'm fine.

147
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,319
Thank you for saving me today.

148
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
I remember my little sister

149
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,319
used to be not so calculating.

150
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,639
So this is the method
you came up to escape?

151
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,240
As expected,

152
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,319
nothing escapes your eyes.

153
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,920
You're skilled in blending scents,
playing with fire,

154
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,240
and know how to make it
look dangerous but not fatal.

155
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,439
This method is truly foolish.

156
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,920
I thought you only
acted ruthless toward me.

157
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,279
I didn't expect you to be

158
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,440
just as cruel to yourself.

159
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,840
If you were to kill someone next time,

160
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,559
would you stab yourself first?

161
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,759
This was the only way.

162
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,399
Shen Qingtang.

163
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,799
Since you entered the manor at eight

164
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,399
and made that vow to me,

165
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,240
you became mine.

166
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,559
Your body and soul

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
all belong to me.

168
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,679
How dare you use yourself

169
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,559
as bait without my consent?

170
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,559
To you, I only have

171
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,039
affection as siblings

172
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,790
and gratitude for saving my life.

173
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,039
I can respect

174
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,360
and honor you,

175
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,720
but between us,

176
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,679
there's no romance.

177
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,600
What are you doing?

178
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,480
Pei Congzhi!

179
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,000
You're heartless to me,

180
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,720
but you know well

181
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,360
my feelings for you.

182
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,399
You even used them.

183
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,840
Since you've used me,

184
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,360
you must repay me.

185
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,480
Pei Congzhi, let go of me!

186
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,279
Pei Congzhi!

187
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,720
I was careless.

188
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,519
Give me half a month

189
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,559
to reconsider.

190
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,600
Fine.

191
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,080
Then I'll wait for my little sister

192
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,440
to give me a satisfying answer.

193
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,799
(Seems only by escaping the manor)

194
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,600
(can I be truly free.)

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,799
How is there another new wound?

196
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,360
Only Eldest Young Master came earlier.

197
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,159
But doesn't he usually treat you best?

198
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,559
Why does he seem so terrifying now?

199
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,080
He's always been

200
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,039
the most terrifying one.

201
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,080
(On that rainy night when I was 15,)

202
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,440
(I was the only one who saw)

203
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,799
(that Lord Pei, said to have been
killed by robbers,)

204
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,680
(Pei Congzhi's father, Pei Yu)
(died by another's hand.)

205
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,519
(I won't say.)

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,120
(Trust me.)

207
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,879
(I won't betray you.)

208
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,970
(From then on, I understood,)

209
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,679
(everyone is just a pawn
in Pei Congzhi's game.)

210
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,720
(I'm no exception.)
