(Disgraced and Defamed)

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,519
I must first ask for Qingtang's opinion.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,879
Since you're also here,

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,920
why not express your stance?

24
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,640
Qingtang.

25
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:42,920
Your Highness.

26
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,270
Since we met again
at the palace banquet,

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,719
I knew you were the one.

28
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,480
Now

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,719
you're unmarried,

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,879
and I've yet to wed.

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,270
If you're willing to spend
your life with me,

32
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,370
I'll treat you well
for the rest of my life

33
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,790
and never take a second wife.

34
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,760
In this world, most romances

35
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,680
end in sorrow.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
There's no need to make

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,960
such grand promises so hastily.

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,599
Qingtang, you must think carefully.

39
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,719
No matter what choice you make,

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,599
I will

41
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,520
always be your retreat.

42
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,719
What's wrong?

43
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,319
I'm grateful for your affection,

44
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,159
but I fear

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm not blessed enough for marriage.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,680
Qingtang.

47
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,199
Qingtang, why are you
acting so foolishly?

48
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,120
I know I'm of low birth,

49
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,240
fated for misfortune
as revealed by the lot.

50
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,280
I can't be a legitimate daughter.

51
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,520
For the sake of love,

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,319
someone like me

53
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,800
would ruin the reputation
of both families.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,199
I'm unwilling to bear
such a heavy burden.

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,400
Better to step back now.

56
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,960
Let's end this here.

57
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,240
Prince Yan Cheng,

58
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,199
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,919
This is a one-sided love.

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,990
Since Qingtang has made her decision,

61
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,719
perhaps you should

62
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,360
choose another noble lady.

Qingtang and I are deeply in love.

68
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,240
Her rejection today

69
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,439
must be because she's been wronged.

70
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,600
She must have her reasons.

71
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,920
Are you saying

72
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,560
a lady of the Pei Manor

73
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,360
was bullied by outsiders?

74
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,920
Maybe by those

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,079
within the manor.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,279
Since this is a matter of the Pei Manor,

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,120
how can outsiders interfere?

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,880
I'll pretend I didn't hear
what was just said.

79
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,560
I hope you'll be more cautious
with you words.

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Yanshu.

81
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:58,959
Yes.

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,079
See the guest out.

83
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,120
Yes.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,480
You...

85
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,319
You dare to sneak away in the night?

86
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,759
Let me go!

87
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,480
Why are you disobedient again?

88
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,759
Pei Congzhi,

89
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,959
you must control my entire life

90
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,240
and destroy my happiness?

91
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,560
I don't love you at all!

92
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,839
It's fine if you don't love me.

93
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,600
Life after life,

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,439
our fate is inseparable.

95
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,199
Even in the netherworld,
even shattered to pieces...

96
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,910
- Let me go!
- We'll never betray each other.

97
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,439
Let me go!

98
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,160
Fate is inseparable.

99
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,480
We'll never betray each other.

100
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,720
Am I truly unable

101
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,959
to escape his control in this life?

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,550
Where is that scent of musk coming from?

103
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,680
Jiang Wan.

104
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,120
I've never wronged her.

105
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,879
Why would she want to harm me?

106
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,439
But I must thank her

107
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,319
for giving me a chance to escape.

108
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,240
Madam Jiang,
out of your own grievances,

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,639
you want to drag me down?

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
This hairpin

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,399
was a gift passed on from Ziqi by you.

112
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,480
But hidden within it

113
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,279
is musk that can render
a woman infertile.

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,279
Ziqi is simple-minded.

115
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,500
The only one capable of such a thing

116
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,279
is you, Madam Jiang.

117
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
I have no past feud with you.

118
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,839
Why would you do such a wicked thing?

119
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,879
You and Pei Congzhi
have long been at odds,

120
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,519
with years of estrangement.

121
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,680
But to target him,

122
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,639
why would you harm

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,759
an innocent outsider like me

124
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,000
in such a vile way?

125
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,120
No need to act like an innocent victim.

126
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,360
You can skip

127
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,399
all that scheming you show

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,519
before the fools of the Pei family.

129
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,879
You and Pei Congzhi
have been secretly involved

130
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,279
behind everyone's backs.

131
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,759
What right do you have to speak of me?

132
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,300
What I have with him

133
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,519
is different from you and your lover.

134
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
I have self-respect.

135
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,399
I only see him as a brother.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,240
I won't be with him,

137
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,240
nor bear his child.

138
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,140
You've got the wrong person.

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,519
I myself am trapped in this manor.

140
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,559
And you want me to help you?

141
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,519
If you

142
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,320
don't want Ziqi's true identity

143
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,840
to be revealed to the world,

144
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,960
then you better help me.

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,480
He even told you about that?

146
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,480
Your tactic for threat
is exactly the same.

147
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,919
It's a shame that Pei Congzhi

148
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,039
does everything he can to keep you,

149
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,960
while you want nothing but to leave him.

150
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,919
Pei Congzhi

151
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,399
truly doesn't deserve anyone's heart.

152
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,559
Fine.

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,679
I'll help you leave the Pei Manor.

154
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,799
Tomorrow, I'll send people out
to the temple to pray.

155
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,200
You can blend in and leave with them.

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,759
Leave the Pei family forever.

157
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,519
Who is it?

158
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,799
Don't worry.

159
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,360
Fresh goods just delivered.

160
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,399
So tender.

161
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:00,919
Who is it?

162
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,399
Pretty girl.

163
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,399
What are you doing?

164
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,360
Let go of me!
I'm a young lady of the Pei Manor!

165
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,279
Lady?

166
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,620
You're in the pleasure house now.

167
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,759
You're a courtesan.

168
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,480
I suggest you

169
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,159
- serve me well,
- Let go of me!

170
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,540
- Let go!
- and you'll suffer less.

171
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,559
Let go of me!

172
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:18,639
You...

173
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,200
Who is it?

174
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,600
You saved me just now.

175
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,799
You must be different
from that vile man.

176
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,519
I'm a young lady of the Pei family.

177
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,039
If it's money you seek,

178
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,559
once you get me out,

179
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,240
you'll be handsomely rewarded.

180
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,080
(I never imagined)

181
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
(that you'd suffer such disgrace.)

182
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,799
Snow on the cliff.

183
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,679
It's really you.

184
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,420
I was kidnapped to the pleasure house.

185
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,279
Was this your plan too?

186
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,320
What,

187
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,559
don't dare to admit it now?

188
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,320
Doing this

189
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,039
only makes you seem more vile.

190
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,080
Leave.

191
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,840
Even if I rot in the mud,

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,790
I don't need your fake kindness
to rescue me.

193
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,519
It wasn't me.

194
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,039
