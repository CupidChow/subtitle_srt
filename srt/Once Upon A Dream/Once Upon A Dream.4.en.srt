(The Peril)

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,959
Greetings, Your Highness.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
What's that on your neck?

23
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,120
Perhaps a mosquito bite.

24
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,719
Is that so?

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,690
The contest with the Yun Kingdom
is near.

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,760
Qingtang, you should attend.

27
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,280
I see you're on good terms
with Prince Yan Cheng.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,879
Why not come enjoy it together?

29
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,439
Since Your Highness asks,
I'll certainly attend.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,200
Then I take my leave.

31
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,800
Shen Qingtang,

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll make you regret approaching him.

33
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,319
Your smile

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,479
is the prettiest.

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,199
But I haven't seen

36
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,400
that smile for a long time.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,719
So long

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
that I almost forgot,

39
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,960
you used to be such a pure-hearted,

40
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,039
innocent girl.

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,919
You're the young lady of the Pei family.

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,879
Why still make incense
and paint umbrellas here?

43
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,439
With me,

44
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,479
your life will always be carefree.

45
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,520
But I can't rely on you forever.

46
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,479
One day,

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,599
I'll leave the Pei Manor
and live on my own.

48
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,479
Leave?

49
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,159
I never knew

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,240
when you started having such thoughts.

51
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,620
(Age 18: May life go smoothly,
soaring high)

52
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,820
(Age 17: May I fly like a wild goose)

53
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,260
(Age 16: May I walk the mountains
and roam freely)

54
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,580
(Age 15: May life be filled
with splendor)

55
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,880
(Age 14: May I savor fragrance
and drink beneath the moon)

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,780
(Age 13: May my letters carry longing,
our hearts as one)

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,919
(Age 5: May I have full meals
and welcome new years)

58
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,639
When did my name

59
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,240
stop appearing

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
in your birthday wishes?

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,280
(Age 18: May life go smoothly,
soaring high)

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,500
Since I understood the difference
between men and women,

63
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,199
freedom

64
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,599
and dignity.

65
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,560
Freedom?

66
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,840
Don't even think about leaving me.

67
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,520
You're mine,

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,759
and only mine.

69
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,479
Pei Congzhi,

70
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,120
please let me go.

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,599
We can only be siblings.

72
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,520
But I want more than just siblings.

73
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,399
I want you to be my woman.

74
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,800
Delusional.

75
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,639
You'll only ever live or die

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,199
in the palm of my hand.

77
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,240
(No matter what means I use,)

78
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,839
(I must leave this place.)

79
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,839
Qingtang.

80
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,120
Cheng.

81
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,399
I waited in the courtyard yesterday
for a long time,

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,000
but you never came.

83
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,480
I thought perhaps

84
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,199
you had grown tired of me.

85
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,600
How could I ever tire of

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,839
someone as good as you?

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,000
It's just I couldn't hold my liquor,

88
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,319
so I returned early.

89
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,240
Please don't take offense.

90
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,439
How could I?

91
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,920
As long as you're still

92
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,839
willing to see me.

93
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,560
This sleeve dart is easy to carry.

94
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,319
When I'm not around,

95
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,319
it can protect you.

96
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,959
Thank you, Cheng.

97
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,360
I'll carry it with me every day.

98
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,240
That must be Pei's adopted daughter,
Shen Qingtang.

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,959
(Lord Pingnan, Yan Hao)

100
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,519
(Lord Pingnan, Yan Hao)
Such beauty indeed.

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,399
(Lord Pingnan, Yan Hao)
No wonder my son is so smitten.

102
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,680
When did you learn such petty tricks,

103
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,319
using your son as bait?

104
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,480
What are your intentions?

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,800
Lord Pei,

106
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,879
what bait?

107
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,360
It's clearly mutual affection.

108
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,959
I'm happy to see it.

109
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,160
This has always been my wish.

110
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,160
With parental consent,

111
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
I shall act as their matchmaker.

112
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,590
An elder brother is like a father.

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120
I'll find a good match for Qingtang.

114
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,879
No need for others to interfere.

115
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,759
Victory to Heng Kingdom's warriors!

116
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:42,920
Very well.

117
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,360
Your Majesty,

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,879
those were the styles
your warriors excel in.

119
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,399
Do they dare try

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,519
the Yun Kingdom's techniques,

121
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,759
the Heart-Strike Whip?

122
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
Heart-Strike Whip?

123
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,079
Brother,

124
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,319
the Heart-Strike Whip

125
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,079
uses a loved one's belonging
as the target

126
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
to compete.

127
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,720
I heard Prince Yan Cheng
is skilled with the whip.

128
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,360
It's the perfect time
to show off our might.

129
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,879
And his beloved girl

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
just so happens to be here.

131
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,720
Qingtang,

132
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,839
would you join him in the contest?

133
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,439
I'm willing.

134
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,720
Should you plead
on your sister's behalf?

135
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,639
No need.

136
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,800
Seems she doesn't mean

137
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
much to you after all.

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,240
Qingtang,

139
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,519
do you trust me?

140
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,480
Of course I do.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,759
For you,

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,639
I'll win.

143
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,079
Look!

144
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,879
Phosphorus flames!

145
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,839
Qingtang, are you alright?

146
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,279
Prince Yan Cheng,

147
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,360
this happened because of you.

148
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,840
If you can't protect her,

149
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,080
then stay away.

150
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,759
Qingtang.

151
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,720
Qingtang.

152
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,159
Your Majesty,

153
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,080
the target was laced with phosphorus.

154
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
Someone clearly meant to use this

155
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,200
to stir tension between us two kingdoms.

156
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,960
I beg Your Majesty to end the contest

157
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,879
and find the one responsible.

158
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,000
Granted.

159
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,559
Let me take you away.

160
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,639
Qingtang.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,970
I can manage on my own.

162
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,799
Give it to me.

163
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,399
This medicine is a royal gift.

164
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,559
It'll ease the pain shortly.

165
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,320
Do you realize

166
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,480
had I arrived a moment later,

167
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,240
you and that dress

168
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,759
would've turned to ashes?

169
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,159
But you knew

170
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,919
this was Princess Zhaohe's doing.

171
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
And you let her get away
with it, didn't you?

172
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,279
Otherwise,

173
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,519
how would you know Yan Cheng

174
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
can't protect you at all?

175
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,639
She targets me

176
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,039
because of you.

177
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,279
You might as well
distance yourself from me,

178
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,039
and we act like normal siblings again.

179
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,840
Marry Princess Zhaohe soon,

180
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,159
so I'll no longer be her target.

181
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,159
You really want me
to marry someone else?

182
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,159
Your engagement with the princess

183
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,519
is a royal decree.

184
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,320
It isn't my place to question.

185
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,879
But she's targeting me because of you.

186
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,159
If you don't marry her soon,

187
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,720
you're making me her constant target.

188
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,240
Such ambushes will never end.

189
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,240
I told you,

190
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,200
you're all I want.

191
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,559
If you agree,

192
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,480
I'll find a way to undo

193
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,080
even the emperor's decree.

194
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,519
Qingtang,

195
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,600
are you alright?

196
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,000
Get away! Don't touch me!

197
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,440
Something's wrong.

198
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
That phosphorus

199
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,440
must be mixed with something else.

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,679
It seems like

201
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,799
she didn't just want me hurt.

202
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,960
She also wanted me humiliated

203
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,840
and utterly disgraced.

204
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:33,840
Don't touch me!

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,720
Qingtang.

206
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,240
Qingtang, please wait.

207
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,039
Prince Yan Cheng.

208
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,279
What?

209
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,360
Why is it okay for him, but not for me?
