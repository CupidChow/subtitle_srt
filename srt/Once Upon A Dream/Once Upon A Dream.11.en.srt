=Episode 11=
(Hope Meets Misfortune)

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,000
I've already stated

22
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,560
it was us Pei family

23
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,319
that refused marriage
to Lord Pingnan Manor,

24
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,980
so we annulled the marriage.

25
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,599
The ripples aren't to be crossed,

26
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,120
as if regretting the stirrup.

27
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,439
You ruined my reputation
with rumors first

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,520
and then insisted on defending me.

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,439
How calculating of you.

30
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,360
I lost

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
this round.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,080
Do you really think

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,560
I'd use those despicable tricks?

34
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,759
In your eyes,

35
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,400
all my struggles

36
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,919
are a joke, aren't they?

37
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,280
How could I think you're a joke?

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
You're a clever girl.

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,039
If you don't run into a wall,

40
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,400
you'll never resign yourself.

41
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,840
You don't want to die.

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
You once made a deal with me.

43
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,960
To give me everything, so I'd save you.

44
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,719
Now you want to live a better life

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,319
and are fighting desperately
to escape from me.

46
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,120
You haven't achieved your goal yet.

47
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,639
How could you just die like this?

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
But a woman like me,

49
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,680
whose reputation is ruined,

50
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,800
has only one path, death.

51
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,280
Am I not

52
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,919
your way out?

53
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,719
Since childhood,

54
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,879
whatever you like,

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
I have to please.

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,639
Whatever you hate,

57
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,159
I have to avoid.

58
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,199
I should've known long ago.

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,530
What you've always wanted

60
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,759
was my surrender

61
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,159
and willing submission.

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,399
Just like now.

63
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
I've accepted my fate.

64
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
I beg you, Congzhi,

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,680
help me.

66
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
What I want

67
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,079
is your willing submission.

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
It was all my fault.

69
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,759
I'll never disobey you again.

70
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,160
Please, Congzhi,

71
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,879
have mercy.

72
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,680
(Pei Congzhi,)

73
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,319
(you're seeking)

74
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,319
(the unattainable desires
in your dreams?)

75
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,439
Since childhood,

76
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,079
whatever you like,

77
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,560
I have to please.

78
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,920
Whatever you hate,

79
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,000
I have to avoid.

80
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
You've always been like this.

81
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,040
But I'm not a caged bird.

82
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,319
I'm a living, breathing person
who longs for freedom and dignity.

83
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,959
I want to take control of my destiny,

84
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
not live the rest of my days

85
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,040
in this deep manor as your plaything.

86
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,839
You don't want to be a caged bird,

87
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,279
but a beast in the forest?

88
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Even so,

89
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,839
I'll still pluck out your claws

90
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,279
one by one,

91
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,120
and break every bone of pride

92
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,240
in your body with my own hands.

93
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,360
Pei Congzhi.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,920
Pei Congzhi.

95
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,639
You'd rather seek death

96
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
than say yes to me?

97
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
You always think

98
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,720
everything is under your control.

99
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
But in this world,

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,639
some things

101
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,360
won't go your way even in death.

102
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,560
Shen Qingtang,

103
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,480
you can please everyone else.

104
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,600
Why won't you go along with me

105
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,879
and love me even a little?

106
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,639
Maybe it's because

107
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm just like you.

108
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,959
Equally cruel,

109
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,800
equally vengeful,

110
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,879
and equally manipulative.

111
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,360
People like us

112
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,279
don't deserve to speak of love.

113
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,720
So,

114
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,559
from the very beginning,

115
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,240
I was wrong, wasn't I?

116
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,039
Between us,

117
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,879
it's been a mistake

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,120
from start to finish.

119
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,840
I know you're heartless.

120
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,279
You can live in this world

121
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,120
without a single attachment.

122
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,840
If one day you dare to die,

123
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
those you care about,

124
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,279
Pei Ziqi,

125
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,600
Caiwei,

126
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,919
and Yan Cheng whom you long for,

127
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,360
will all die with you.

128
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,240
You...

129
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,399
(Even if it's a mistake,)

130
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,519
(I'll still keep you by my side.)

131
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,279
(To lean on in life,)

132
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,080
(and to lie with in death.)

133
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
(Never to betray in life or death.)

134
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,960
What's wrong, Young Master?

135
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,879
Nothing.

136
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,679
Is it about Miss Qingtang?

137
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
You haven't told her yet

138
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
that the rumors weren't your doing?

139
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,919
You even had a big quarrel

140
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,559
with Madam Pei for her during the day.

141
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,799
The arrangements have been made.

142
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,000
There will be blood at the wedding.

143
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,120
It won't proceed as planned.

144
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,039
Good.

145
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,960
Today, the news about Miss
ending up in Tianshui Lane

146
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,320
somehow got out.

147
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,440
It's spreading around the city

148
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,990
being said in the ugliest ways.

149
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,120
It seems

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,990
we're not the only ones
who don't want the wedding

151
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,399
to go smoothly today.

152
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,039
With such disgrace on the wedding day,

153
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,720
even if the marriage is annulled,

154
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
how can we salvage our reputation?

155
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,770
Even if she dies out there today,

156
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,230
she mustn't return to the Pei Manor.

157
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,879
Grandmother,

158
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,440
alive or dead,

159
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,720
Qingtang is part of the Pei family.

160
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,279
She's also mine.

161
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,960
Wretched child!

162
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,200
You'd disgrace yourself
over an adopted girl.

163
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,080
Put down all the betrothal gifts.

164
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
Take them away.

165
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,639
Go.

166
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,000
Madam Pei.

167
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,039
You truly mean well.

168
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,480
Why not let her know?

169
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,799
Now she's resented you.

170
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,120
In her eyes,

171
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,480
everything I do is disgraceful.

172
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,639
Why make her understand me?

173
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,690
But now that this has come to light,

174
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,679
I fear Miss Shen's days in the Pei Manor

175
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,399
will be even harder from now on.

176
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,990
Look into the matter of the rumors.

177
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,799
Find out exactly

178
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,240
who it was.

179
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,200
Yes.

180
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,690
Drink some water.

181
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,440
The future is long.

182
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,840
A real man knows when to subdue.

183
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,759
Moping over a woman?

184
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,759
Where's the dignity?

185
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,159
What dignity?

186
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,519
What future?

187
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
If I go to the frontier,

188
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,279
it'll be several years.

189
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,320
How will I ever see Qingtang again?

190
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,799
You really are hopeless.

191
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,290
All those years of studying
military strategy for nothing.

192
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,840
Sun Tzu's Art of War,
among the 36 stratagems,

193
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,080
Stratagem Eight,

194
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,120
recite it.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,440
I...

196
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,919
Feign one thing while doing another.

197
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,039
Father,

198
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,080
are you allowing me
to elope with Qingtang?

199
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,840
Alright.

200
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,000
Stay calm.

201
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,519
Right now, your mother's
watching you closely.

202
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,159
You'll have to wait a few days
before you can return.

203
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,919
Yes, Father.
