(When River Clears)

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,640
Your Highness, thank you

22
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,680
for coming to celebrate my birthday.

23
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,719
In the future, when you marry Congzhi

24
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,519
and move into the manor,
we'll all be one family.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,519
How perfect that will be.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,879
Once we're married,

27
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,280
Congzhi's elders will be my elders.

28
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,359
I'll be sure to bring you

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,680
into my manor to enjoy a life of ease.

30
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,680
Thank you for your consideration.

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,439
But Congzhi is filial

32
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,040
and cherishes his siblings dearly.

33
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,519
He always says

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,719
he must first arrange
good marriages for all siblings

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,799
before he can marry me.

36
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,400
Madam Pei,

37
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,359
although Qingtang previously

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,000
missed the match with Prince Yan Cheng,

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,079
a girl's youth slips away quickly.

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,840
She should be given

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
a good marriage soon.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,039
Indeed.

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,780
But Eldest Young Master
cherishes Miss Qingtang deeply.

44
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,599
He doesn't favor any of the noblemen

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,280
who came to propose.

46
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,199
Then why not let me arrange it?

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,840
I'll ask my brother to bestow her

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,599
a marriage that she can't refuse.

49
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,719
Excellent idea.

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,719
Miss,

51
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,159
it's Prince Yan Cheng.

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,680
Qingtang,

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,639
the annulment wasn't my intention.

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,620
Ever since learning you were wronged,

55
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,919
I've been restless day and night,
making plans in secret.

56
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,890
If your heart is still with me,

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,599
meet me at the East Street tonight.

58
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,690
Let's elope together,

59
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,520
and from then on roam freely,

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,000
loyal to the end.

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you doing?

62
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,800
Why so flustered?

63
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,280
Are you hiding something good?

64
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,919
Just now while painting the sky lantern,

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,159
I accidentally

66
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,159
stained my hand with ink.

67
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,199
The prayer isn't finished yet.

68
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,639
If you're free,

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,280
why not help me add a few lines?

70
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,479
Make the wish on your behalf?

71
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,599
So,

72
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,680
you're not angry with me anymore?

73
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,319
Today is Madam Pei's birthday banquet.

74
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,039
I'm not so petty.

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
I don't like the words

76
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,680
written on this lantern.

77
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,900
(An elder brother as a husband)

78
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,039
Pei Zongzhi, are you mad?

79
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,319
You should know

80
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,000
this is what's in my heart.

81
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,960
I have no other desires.

82
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,970
Yet none of my requests

83
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,680
are things you can fulfill.

84
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,840
Besides,

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,319
isn't your wedding with Zhaohe

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
approaching?

87
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,490
As for your requests,

88
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,800
these days,

89
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,510
I've thought about them carefully.

90
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,820
I'll do everything in my power

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,920
to fulfill all your wishes.

92
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,879
Be it annulling the marriage
with Zhaohe,

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,079
or returning to Lingchuan.

94
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,399
I just

95
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,759
need a little time.

96
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,839
Will you wait for me?

97
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,160
All right.

98
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,160
In that case,

99
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,199
this will be our vow.

100
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,680
Qingtang,

101
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,639
you must hold to it.

102
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,760
Though I can't return
to Lingchuan with you now,

103
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,319
I retrieved

104
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,839
this hairpin from Lingchuan.

105
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,000
It's a keepsake from your mother.

106
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,920
Mother, look at this hairpin.

107
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,160
It's pretty.

108
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,399
Doesn't it suit me well?

109
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,399
You look lovely in anything.

110
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,160
You're so kind, Mother.

111
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,600
Mother, look!

112
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,720
They're all flying up!

113
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,879
So high!

114
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,040
This place

115
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,439
isn't your manor
where you can act so wantonly.

116
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,680
(An elder brother as a husband)
What a virtuous sibling bond.

117
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,800
Pei Congzhi,

118
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,519
I didn't come to your manor

119
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,759
to watch you and that pauper

120
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,079
put on a lovers' drama

121
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,600
in secret intimacy.

122
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,600
This isn't secret intimacy.

123
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
I'll make her my lawful wife.

124
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,580
What do you mean by that?

125
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,759
Before court ended today,

126
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,519
I petitioned His Majesty

127
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,240
to annul the marriage bestowed upon us.

128
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,360
What?

129
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,959
How dare you!

130
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,639
That's impossible.

131
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,879
This concerns the dignity of a princess.

132
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,600
My brother would never approve

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,639
such a ludicrous request.

134
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,319
Your Highness, how much

135
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,959
do you think
your honor and dignity are truly worth?

136
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,860
Can it outweigh the tribute
of ten years from foreign lands

137
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
and a ceasefire with neighboring nations

138
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,439
that I earned through years of toil?

139
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,399
You're but a royal servant.

140
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,530
And yet you dare to challenge a princess
like a flea attacking a giant tree?

141
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,990
If Your Highness doesn't believe me,

142
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,720
then let's wait and see.

143
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,000
Fine.

144
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,519
Let's see which comes first,

145
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,720
your annulment or my brother
bestowing Qingtang's marriage.

146
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,040
Qingtang,

147
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,000
I thought you wouldn't come.

148
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,920
Our annulled marriage before,

149
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,439
the rumors at Tianshui Lane,

150
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,680
I failed to protect you.

151
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,279
It was my fault.

152
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,560
I know

153
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,560
you weren't free to act.

154
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,759
How could I blame you?

155
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,959
When I left, I avoided the people
of Pei family and spies.

156
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,399
No one should notice.

157
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,439
Take me away.

158
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,800
Let's leave here together.

159
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,519
All right.

160
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,040
Let's escape the mundane world.

161
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,120
From now on,

162
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,199
I'll be by your side,

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,839
never letting you suffer again.

164
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,319
Congzhi,

165
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,780
we've known each other
for over a decade.

166
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,720
For the sake of our past,

167
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,759
please show mercy.

168
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,170
Let me take Qingtang away.

169
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,399
I'll treat her well,

170
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,600
and never fail her.

171
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,519
Prince Yan Cheng,

172
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,160
my sister is still young
and doesn't understand the world.

173
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,159
As her elder brother,

174
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
I can't allow her to commit

175
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,559
such a rebellious act as elopement.

176
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,759
Shen Qingtang,

177
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,240
come here now.

178
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,120
It was my idea.

179
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,660
It has nothing to do with Qingtang.

180
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,320
Such deep affection
from you is touching.

181
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,360
Qingtang,

182
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,559
why not take this chance

183
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,559
to speak your true thoughts

184
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,840
from this past while?

185
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,480
Think carefully.

186
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,759
If you really leave,

187
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,480
there are some people

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
you'll never be able
to see again in this lifetime.

189
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,460
Thank you for your love, Your Highness.

190
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,480
But unfortunately,

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you and I

192
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
aren't meant to be.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,039
I wish you peace, prosperity,

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,100
and a smooth official path.

195
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,919
Qingtang,

196
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,759
don't be afraid.

197
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,159
Come with me.

198
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,840
Your Highness,

199
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,759
I never

200
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,559
had true feelings for you.

201
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,480
She merely coveted the power
of Lord Pingnan Manor

202
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
and desired wealth and status.

203
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,159
Qingtang.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,759
I don't believe it.

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,840
Why would you suddenly say such things?

206
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,799
Then what about all

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
our time together before?

208
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,240
I grew tired of being an adopted girl.

209
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,480
I just want to be a noble lady.

210
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,919
Marrying you

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,970
or marrying someone else

212
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,240
is all the same.
