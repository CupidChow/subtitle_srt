(A Dream Under the Sophora Tree)

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,799
You clearly didn't.

22
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,599
Why must you...

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,519
Even if that day

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,599
I didn't do anything,

25
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,439
can we still

26
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,519
be considered innocent now?

27
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,439
Why not?

28
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,490
If you truly didn't care

29
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,840
about my feelings and will,

30
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,239
you could've made sure

31
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,159
there was no turning back
for us that day.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,719
But in the end, you didn't do it,

33
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,200
did you?

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,439
Pei Congzhi,

35
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,200
even if I become Yan Cheng's wife,

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,760
for the rest of my life,

37
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,560
I'll still pray for you and help you

38
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,760
as your sister with all sincerity.

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,840
I hope you can find someone as well.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,120
Let everything return
to its proper course, alright?

41
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,639
Shen Qingtang,

42
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,479
I just want to know,

43
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,280
all these years, have you ever

44
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,719
had even a little fondness for me?

45
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,599
You really think you're a young lady?

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,599
Get out!

47
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,599
Young Master, spare me.

48
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,280
I once entrusted myself fully,

49
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,319
and truly trusted you.

50
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,719
But

51
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,120
to you,

52
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,319
what am I, exactly?

53
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,840
A toy to satisfy your need for control?

54
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,000
Or a tool to kill or discard

55
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,120
when things don't go your way?

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Even if there's affection

57
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,879
between us,

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,840
how can it compare to family status,

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,879
imperial marriage,

60
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,840
and my boundless fear?

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,919
Let me out!

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,199
Let me out!

63
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,960
Let me out!

64
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:26,759
No.

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,599
I've never had

66
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,479
any feelings for you,

67
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,120
let alone love.

68
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,759
So what if you don't love me?

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,319
I'll still do whatever it takes
to keep you.

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
I'll wait at home

71
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,759
for you to return.

72
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,300
(Happiness)

73
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,199
Caiwei, how much farther?

74
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,000
Almost. Once we pass this intersection,

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,279
It'll be Lord Pingnan Manor.

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,079
(It must go smoothly.)

77
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,639
(Lord Pingnan Manor)

78
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,839
The bride has arrived.

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,390
Why is no one here for the wedding?

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,700
They won't even open the door.

81
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,639
Caiwei.

82
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,399
Don't panic, Miss.

83
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,759
I'll go ahead to check.

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,260
They've been here for ages
and no one opened the door.

85
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,920
Could it really be canceled?

86
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,639
If that's true,

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,399
the Pei family will be disgraced.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,720
It's open.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,519
It's open.

90
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,890
Just go. Lord Pingnan Manor
annulled the marriage.

91
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,800
Impossible.

92
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,240
Prince Yan Cheng sent
a formal betrothal gift

93
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,399
and promised to marry Miss Qingtang.

94
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,399
How can they go back on their word?

95
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,670
We want to see the prince!

96
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,319
Step aside!

97
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,000
Didn't you know what Miss Shen has done?

98
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,560
A woman who ended up in Tianshui Lane
isn't worthy of marrying the prince.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,560
Leave now.

100
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,000
If I were her,

101
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,160
I'd have long hanged myself.

102
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,000
Exactly.

103
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,920
Miss,

104
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
they won't let us in the manor.

105
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,590
They said they want
to annul the marriage.

106
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,720
Miss Shen, please go back.

107
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,240
The breakup letter will be delivered
to the Pei Manor soon.

108
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,600
I made an agreement
with Prince Yan Cheng.

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,199
We were to marry today.

110
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,399
He personally proposed.

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,390
Even if he won't marry me now,

112
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,360
I'll wait for him to come out

113
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,319
and tell me himself.

114
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,279
Mother, the auspicious hour has arrived.

115
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,879
Qingtang is still waiting outside.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Please let me out!

117
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,600
How could you hide
such a big matter from me?

118
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,319
Mother, I didn't!

119
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,240
The day in Tianshui Lane,
I personally rescued Qingtang.

120
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,360
I can testify,

121
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,399
she's innocent.

122
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
She was a victim of misfortune.

123
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,260
I didn't tell you
because I was afraid you'd overthink.

124
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,399
Afraid I'd overthink?

125
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,490
You were afraid I'd learn the truth

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
and refuse to approve this marriage.

127
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,560
Now that I know,

128
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,120
there's no way I'll let you bring
such a bride into this manor.

129
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
Lock him in the ancestral hall!

130
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,620
- Mother!
- Without my permission,

131
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,490
he's not to come out!

132
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,000
Father, help me!

133
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,160
Mother,

134
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,639
don't make me resent you!

135
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,240
Mother!

136
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,000
I'd rather you hate me for life

137
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,199
than let you live the rest of it

138
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,160
under others' ridicule.

139
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,079
What?

140
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,480
You still feel regret?

141
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,040
If you had listened to me,

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,839
and chosen a well-matched
marriage for Cheng,

143
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,560
this farce wouldn't have happened.

144
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,279
Why did it...

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
Why did it spread?

146
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,279
From today on,

147
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
if he still doesn't give up

148
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,220
and keeps thinking about that girl,

149
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,000
take him back to the frontier.

150
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,000
That'll break the obsession.

151
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,120
