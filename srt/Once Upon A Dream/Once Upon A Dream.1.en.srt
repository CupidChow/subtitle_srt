Let me out!

39
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,719
Miss, are you having another nightmare?

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,199
Ever since you returned
from Wang'an Temple,

41
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,599
you often have nightmares
and can't sleep well.

42
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll inform Madam Pei,

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,080
(Maid, Caiwei)
and find a physician for you.

44
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,280
Caiwei.

45
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,919
(Adopted daughter of the Pei family,
Shen Qingtang)

46
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,690
I've lived in their manor
since I was little.

47
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,639
Better not trouble grandmother.

48
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
I'll be fine in a few days.

49
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,039
Qingtang,

50
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,520
I brought some lingzhi for you.

51
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,850
Second Young Master.

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,719
Thank you for coming, Jingming.

53
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,879
But this lingzhi is too precious.

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,599
I can't accept it.

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,439
Caiwei, serve tea.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,380
Second Young Master
brought the medicine himself.

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,159
Why are you acting so aloof?

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,639
(Pei family's second son, Pei Jingming)
Quickly brew the medicine.

59
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,319
(Second Young Master's maid, Xinglu)

60
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:04,800
But...

61
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,879
Hurry up.

62
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,560
Qingtang.

63
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,439
You're not feeling well.

64
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,000
I know a bit about medicine.

65
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,439
How about I take a look at you?

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
Jingming, please respect me.

67
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,680
This is improper.

68
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,759
Qingtang, I've admired you
for a long time.

69
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,920
Don't reject me.

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,279
Jingming!

71
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,439
Madam Pei!

72
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,990
Second Young Master came
to Xianxue Courtyard again with Xinglu.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,959
Please help Miss Qingtang.

74
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,519
I beg you.

75
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,399
I beg you!

76
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,120
(Pei family, Madam Pei)

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,680
The day is long.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,279
The crabapple blossoms should bloom.

79
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,240
Don't refuse a kind offer.

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Xinglu is already carrying my child.

81
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,959
But grandmother insists
I marry a proper wife first

82
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,439
then take her as a concubine.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,079
In the West Courtyard,

84
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,160
we happen to lack a wife like you.

85
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,360
I came to you sincerely,

86
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,199
yet you don't appreciate it.

87
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,639
You'll marry into
the West Courtyard soon.

88
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,759
Why not learn the ways of a woman now?

89
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
You and I serving the same husband.

90
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,879
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,920
Aren't you afraid

92
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,959
of grandmother's punishment?

93
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,560
Right now, grandmother

94
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
is probably picking

95
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,519
an auspicious wedding date for us.

96
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,480
I won't marry you.

97
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,879
Who do you think you are?

98
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,279
What are you doing?

99
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm telling you.

100
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,199
Everything you have

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,519
has been provided by the Pei family.

102
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,920
Even your chastity

103
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,040
wouldn't be enough to repay
what Pei family has given you.

104
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,480
Second Young Master, stop it!

105
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,240
Eldest Young Master is back!

106
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,079

107
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,800
Shen Qingtang,

108
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,560
you can't escape.

109
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,639
In this family,

110
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,759
no one can save you.

111
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,439
Let's go.

112
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,040
Miss,

113
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,240
are you okay?

114
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,759
Miss, don't be upset.

115
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,800
There must be.

116
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,480
There must be a way out.

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,120
Caiwei,

118
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,399
did Eldest Young Master really return?

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,390
Eldest Young Master is coming back.

120
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,319
Everyone, be alert.

121
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,839
He values cleanliness.

122
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,040
Keep the courtyard tidy.

123
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Light the lamps.

visited her earlier today.

She doesn't like the smell of blood.

Anything?

185

Anything at all.

186
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,879
I can write a formal agreement.

187
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,399
But what if I say

188
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,559
that the price to stop
this marriage to Pei Jingming

189
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,879
is for you to become my woman?

190
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,840
Brother, what kind of joke is this?

191
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,960
I never joke.

192
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,559
But in my heart,

193
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,840
you've always been my brother.

194
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,919
Can we trade something else?

195
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,039
What else do you have to offer?

196
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:31,720
Shen Qingtang,

197
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,240
have you forgotten

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
when you were eight,

199
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,919
you already gave me everything

200
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,320
in exchange for your life?

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,440
Get out.

202
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,039
Using a lock to blackmail
the Pei family?

203
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,080
I wasn't blackmailing.

204
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,799
Grandmother and Madam Pei
were sworn sisters.

205
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,159
My whole family perished.

206
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,559
I beg Madam Pei to take me in.

207
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,480
Go away.

208
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,180
(Pei Manor)

209
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,740
(Human trafficker)

210
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,200
Open the door!

211
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,799
- Let me go!
- Be quiet.

212
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,620
- Let me go!
- I can sell you to a good home.

213
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,120
What are you doing at the Pei Manor?

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,799
Eldest Young Master,

215
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,440
my daughter ran away.

216
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,639
I was disciplining her.

217
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Go, hurry.

218
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,519
Help me, I'm not his daughter!
- Go.

219
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,990
I'm the daughter of the Shen family.

220
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,639
Go.

221
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,159
Please, help me, brother.

222
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,159
Brother?

223
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,720
Get lost.

224
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
The Pei family doesn't
take in the useless.

225
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,090
You want me to help you.

226
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,639
What can you give?

227
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,240
Everything.

228
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,039
I'm willing to give everything I have.

229
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,120
From now on,

230
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,039
you're my sister.

231
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,440
I'll protect you from all harm,

232
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,159
and you must be loyal to me.

233
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,960
Unless parted by death,

234
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,919
no betrayal, no departure.

235
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Alright.

236
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,360
It was my wishful thinking.

237
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,039
Let's pretend

238
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,720
this conversation never happened.

239
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,120
Shen Qingtang,

240
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,639
you have nothing left.

241
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,279
Even your life belongs to me.

242
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,039
Where are you trying to run off to?

243
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,200
Sister, why are you being
disobedient again?

244
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,919
Where are you trying to run off to?

245
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,559
(It can't be.)

246
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
(It was only a dream.)

247
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,639
The wedding grandmother arranged
is in half a month.

248
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,600
Let's make that the deadline.

249
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
If you agree,

250
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,240
I'll continue to handle
all these troubles for you.

251
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,879
Give you what you want

252
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,159
just like all these years.

253
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,039
But if you refuse,

254
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,039
I won't interfere in your marriage

255
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,960
to Jingming in the slightest.

256
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,440
Miss,

257
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,799
Eldest Young Master

258
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,799
have feelings for you.

259
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,639
Perhaps this isn't a bad thing.

260
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,440
But to me,

261
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,400
the so-called feelings
is just another pit.

262
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,559
I won't agree to him.

263
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,919
Nor will I marry Pei Jingming.

264
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,559
Miss Xinglu,

265
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,919
why don't I see Jingming

266
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,000
with you today?

267
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,320
Why?

268
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,720
So eager to seduce Jingming?

269
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,919
Don't forget you're a jinx
who caused your parents' death.

270
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,840
Even if you marry him,

271
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,399
you're only fit to wash my feet.

272
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,240
You're just relying on the child
in your belly

273
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,639
to gain petty power in this courtyard.

274
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,320
But the things you did,

275
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
those shameful acts done in secret,

276
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,600
even prostitutes in brothels
wouldn't stoop so low.

277
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,490
I may be a lonely orphan
adopted by the Pei family,

278
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,559
but I have plenty of ways

279
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
to deal with you and your child.

280
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:38,679
What do you want?

281
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,440
You dare harm me and my unborn child?

282
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,000
Careful, I'll tell Jingming.
