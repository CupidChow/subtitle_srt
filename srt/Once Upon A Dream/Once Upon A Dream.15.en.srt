21
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:23,879
Let go of me.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,400
Let go of me.

23
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,580
What are you trying to do?

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,480
Shen Qingtang,

25
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,239
why don't you tell me
what you're trying to do.

26
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,000
Why did you run?

27
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,959
Why did you lie to me?

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Why did you betray me?

29
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,400
Let go of me!

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,239
When you promised to live
and die with him,

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,879
did you even think of me for a moment?

32
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,200
Don't touch me!

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
Do you hate me that much?

34
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,120
Yes.

35
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,000
I hate you to the bone.

36
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,799
If it weren't for you,

37
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,959
I'd have already eloped with Yan Cheng,

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,190
living freely together by now.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,480
So you love him that much?

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,760
Love?

41
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,680
Someone like you

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,239
will never understand what love is.

43
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,250
As long as I get the chance,

44
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,519
I'll keep running,

45
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,000
until I'm far away from you.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
Shen Qingtang,

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
all these years, I've worked tirelessly

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,840
just to give you the best.

49
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,960
Is that still not enough?

50
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,360
If I hadn't brought you
into the Pei Manor back then,

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,120
what kind of fate you'd be facing now?

52
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,879
There are many places in this world
where you can't even die if you want to.

53
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,759
Is that where you'd rather go?

54
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,800
If living like this,

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,120
without dignity or freedom,

56
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,879
then I'd rather die

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
than stay by your side.

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,039
It was you who broke your promise first.

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,120
Why does it feel like
all the fault is mine?

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,199
Let go of me!

61
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,800
If ten years

62
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,280
can't earn your love,

63
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,199
then your hate

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,759
will be my compensation.

65
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,240
(From then on,)

66
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,800
(Pei Congzhi seemed to go mad,)

67
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,360
(thoroughly mad.)

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,400
(Maybe it truly was my fault.)

69
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,380
(I should've never knocked
on Pei Manor's door)

70
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
(on that rainy night.)

71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,390
(I knew full well that his existence)

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,039
(was the abyss I'd never escape.)

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,400
(But why is it that in these
countless days and nights,)

74
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,240
(I keep sinking into it,)

75
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,240
(falling for him,)

76
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,360
(unable to stop myself?)

77
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,919
(So I kept taking
contraceptive medicine.)

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,570
(He stubbornly asked me
whether I loved him or not.)

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,240
(Be it love,)

80
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,400
(or hate,)

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,080
(what meaning does it have)

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,879
(if I can't be free?)

83
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,960
(Pei Congzhi,)

84
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,199
(in this life,)

85
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,919
(I swear)

86
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,080
(I'll make sure you lose completely.)

87
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,400
You say you hate me,

88
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,800
but your body doesn't lie.

89
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,840
Qingtang,

90
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,079
tell me.

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,040
Have you ever

92
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
liked me even for a moment?

93
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,990
Even if I liked you,

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,560
even just a little,

95
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,319
I've known since I was young,

96
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,680
there's a deep abyss

97
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,360
between us

98
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,160
that will always be there.

99
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,399
Even that little bit of affection

100
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,319
is enough.

101
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,319
Qingtang,

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,500
you're willing to take this one step.

103
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,000
Then let me bridge

104
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,959
the abyss for you.

105
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,600
Fine.

106
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,800
I hurt you last night.

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Pei Congzhi, shut up.

108
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
If you're angry,

109
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,680
then I won't do that again.

110
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,290
Ziqi wants to invite you to the palace.

111
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,310
She's been missing you dearly.

112
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,480
I've accepted on your behalf.

113
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,680
Take it as a bit of amusement.

114
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,680
Will you go?

115
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,519
Fine, now let me go.

116
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,680
Come on, Qingtang.

117
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's not keep grandmother waiting.

118
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,240
Greetings, Grandmother.

119
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
Greetings, Grandmother.

120
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,800
Sit.

121
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,240
Miss Qingtang,

122
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,879
what happened to your wrist?

123
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,160
I got crawled on
by a centipede last night.

124
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,720
These venomous insects
lately have been horrible.

125
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,230
There's no way to guard against them.

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
Grandmother, take extra care.

127
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,000
Eldest Young Master, what about you?

128
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,639
Got scratched by a stray cat.

129
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,800
It's nothing.

130
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,399
You're this happy

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,720
just to see Ziqi?

132
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,519
Ziqi lives in the palace now,

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
so we rarely get to meet.

134
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,000
She was one of the few in Pei Manor
who treated me sincerely.

135
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,439
Her heart is pure,

136
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,959
unlike some, full of scheming.

137
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,720
Is that hard?

138
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,240
If you want to see her,

139
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,720
the scheming one can bring you.

140
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,399
As long as it makes you happy.

141
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:33,920
Pei Congzhi.

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,560
You seem different.

143
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,399
How so?

144
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,839
I'm not sure.

145
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,399
But compared to before,

146
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,879
you seem more human.

147
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,519
You've changed too.

148
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,000
This is the palace.

149
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,679
Congzhi, Qingtang!

150
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,759
Qingtang,

151
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,799
while Congzhi is seeing His Majesty,

152
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,960
we can chat more.

153
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,240
Qingtang,

154
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,400
let me ask you something.

155
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,279
How long have you
and Congzhi been together?

156
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
You saw it just now.

157
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
Don't get me wrong.

158
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,879
We...we're just...

159
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm married now.

160
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,970
I understand matters
between men and women.

161
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,480
The way Congzhi looks at you

162
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
isn't pure.

163
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
But that's good.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,559
The world's harsh on women.

165
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,320
I was worried when I heard

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,919
your marriage with Prince Yan Cheng

167
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,960
was annulled.

168
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,039
But now, if Congzhi is protecting you,

169
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,440
then I believe

170
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,159
your future will be secure.

171
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,039
Ziqi,

172
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
don't you think it's strange?

173
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,279
He and I are siblings.

174
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,320
You and Pei Manor share no blood ties.

175
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,360
Why be so bound by that?

176
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,799
Besides, even before,

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,159
I always thought

178
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
Congzhi treated you differently.

179
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,519
Looking back,

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,279
that special treatment
wasn't sibling affection,

181
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,320
but proof that you're in his heart.

182
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,519
That favoritism,

183
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,440
perhaps it's just

184
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,840
his need for control.

185
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,360
Congzhi entered service at 17.

186
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,679
He became a top scholar
and entered the Hanlin Academy.

187
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,200
His Majesty gave him
a piece of volcano jade.

188
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,799
Pei Jingming and I wanted to see it,
but he wouldn't let us.

189
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,000
But he gave it to you.

190
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,879
Yes, that's the one.

191
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,480
Another time,
he went to Yongzhou to manage the river.

192
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
I was childish

193
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,559
and wanted him to hurry back

194
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,279
to bring me mung bean cakes
from Yongzhou.

195
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,639
So I sent a letter

196
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,320
saying you had a high fever.

197
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,159
Yongzhou is three days from the capital.

198
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,000
He made it back in a day and a night.

199
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,200
But when he returned,

200
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,799
his horse collapsed,

201
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
and so did he.

202
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,879
No wonder

203
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,799
all our doctors went to Guiya Courtyard.

204
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
I thought he was attacked.

205
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,960
It was just too embarrassing,

206
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,639
so he ordered me never
to mention it to you.

207
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,559
You matter more to him
than a lot of things.

208
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,240
If you didn't,

209
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,279
why would he reject
so many noble ladies?

210
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,360
Qingtang,

211
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,639
why not let go of your doubts,

212
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,000
accept him,

213
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,279
and try to see the good in him?

214
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,360
(If that stormy night back then)

215
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,919
(hadn't ended in tragedy,)

216
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,910
(perhaps the pain between us)

217
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,159
(would've had an end,)

218
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
(and the future a path forward.)
