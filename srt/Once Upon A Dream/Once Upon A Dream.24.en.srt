(Fated for Each Other)

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,959
Young Master,
is your wound hurting again?

22
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:35,680
It's nothing.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,079
Young Master,

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
why are you now so timid

25
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,959
and hesitant when it comes to Miss Shen?

26
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,040
Fear is born from love.

27
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,390
After all that's happened,

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,480
how could I act recklessly like before?

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,280
Why not speak your heart

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,480
and take her back from Yan Cheng?

31
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,079
This time,

32
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,599
I don't want to force her.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,159
If this is truly what she wants,

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,120
as long as she's happy

35
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:13,960
and content,

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,639
that's enough.

37
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,719
Miss,

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,639
what's wrong?

39
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,520
Didn't...

40
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,719
Didn't you go see
Young Master Yan today?

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,159
He left.

42
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,120
Left?

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,639
Where did he go?

44
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,800
He's gone back to the frontier
in the desert.

45
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,639
Miss,

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
you've remembered everything?

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,240
Then...

48
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,680
You and Prince Yan Cheng...

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,599
Today,

50
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,479
I went to see Pei Congzhi.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
What happened?

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
I had planned to tell him

53
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,080
I had decided to let go of the past

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,360
and try to start anew with him.

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,479
But he told me

56
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,879
he's returning to the capital

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
to resume his position

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,400
as the high and mighty chief minister.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,039
Is there really no other way?

60
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,400
(Medical House)

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,759
Before, Lord Pingnan shot Lord Pei
with an arrow,

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,560
and now he's contracted the plague.

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,599
I have no medicine for this.

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,390
I can only suppress it
with potent remedies.

65
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,439
But continuing this way,

66
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm afraid his life is in danger.

67
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,990
I should bring the young master
back to the capital

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
to seek a renowned physician.

69
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,000
Miss Shen,

70
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,240
what are you doing here?

71
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,639
Where's your young master?

72
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,240
He's not receiving visitors.

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,959
It's fine if he isn't.

74
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,120
But Yanshu,

75
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,920
do you really want to watch him die?

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,360
I don't.

77
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,480
I once contracted the plague,

78
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,790
but recovered without medication.

79
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,319
Perhaps my blood can help.

80
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,759
This medicine seems to be effective.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,759
But why does it carry

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,120
a trace of blood?

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,040
Does it?

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,759
Perhaps Physician Zhao found

85
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,439
some rare ingredient.

86
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,990
Thanks to you who risked your life
and added your blood to the medicine,

87
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,959
the young master's condition improved.

88
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,360
You're my young master's savior.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,210
Why did you hide it from him?

90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,240
Why travel

91
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,120
all this way to save me

92
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,920
only to leave without a word?

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,800
I

94
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,480
only wished to repay the kindness
you once showed me.

95
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,720
I've always been a rootless wanderer,

96
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,720
never hoped for attachments.

97
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,319
We met by chance.

98
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,920
Let's part here.

99
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,290
You're going back to Lingchuan,

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,720
to marry Yan Cheng?

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Can you not marry him?

102
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,319
Since you'll return to the capital

103
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
and be the chief minister,

104
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,000
why bother thinking of
a rural woman like me?

105
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,759
I don't want to be the madam
in a grand manor,

106
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,839
nor do I want to be trapped
in that cage.

107
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,959
Becoming an official

108
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,920
was never what I wanted.

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,279
You want to return to Lingchuan,

110
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,470
live a peaceful and carefree life.

111
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,639
That's the freedom
you've worked so hard to obtain.

112
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
I have no right to keep you.

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
But Qingtang,

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,639
I can't let go.

115
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,519
Can't let go?

116
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,120
But on what grounds?

117
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,360
You always said we must start over.

118
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Then pretend

119
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,959
you never saw me
outside the Pei Manor back then.

120
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,199
You've

121
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,399
remembered everything?

122
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,360
Yes,

123
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,680
I've remembered it all,

124
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,600
and everything you once did to me.

125
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
It was my fault.

127
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,480
I don't deserve

128
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,879
to ask for your forgiveness.

129
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,160
Leave.

130
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
Since you've chosen Yan Cheng,

131
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,519
I'll keep my promise

132
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,199
to let you go.

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,480
Yan Cheng returned
to the desert long ago.

134
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,840
There was never

135
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,000
an engagement between us.

136
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,960
Pei Congzhi,

137
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,440
from the promise made in the rain,

138
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,840
we've been shadow-bound siblings,

139
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,879
rivals entangled in vengeance,

140
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,240
and lovers who share joy and sorrow.

141
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,590
All the happiness, anger,
sorrow, and joy in my life

142
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,399
have always been tied to you.

143
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Now,

144
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,200
how could we part so easily?

145
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,320
Between you and me,
it should always be like this.

146
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,240
Bound by life and death,

147
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,519
tied by love and hate,

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,840
for a lifetime.

149
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,519
Would you be willing

150
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,360
to start over with me?

151
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,159
I, Pei Congzhi,

152
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,120
wish only for this,

153
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,840
