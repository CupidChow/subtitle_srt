=Episode 6=
(Calamity Comes Unannounced)

21
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,519
You went through all that trouble

22
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,239
to have Caiwei bring Yan Cheng
into the manor,

23
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,760
and timed it perfectly

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,799
to stage a scene of mutual affection
before grandmother.

25
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,560
What a clever move.

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,799
I'm flattered.

27
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,280
When it comes to scheming,

28
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,280
I'm not even a tenth as skilled as you.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
But in the past,

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,079
you weren't such a calculating girl.

31
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,200
I don't like

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,799
a sister like this.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,040
Will you only learn to behave

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,000
once Yan Cheng is gone?

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,879
Prince Yan Cheng is pure and kind.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
I hope you won't drag him

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,120
into our disputes.

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
Pure and kind?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,919
How well do you even know Yan Cheng?

40
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,919
Not too well,
but enough to entrust him with my life.

41
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,759
You're still naive,

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,240
trusting in fleeting affections

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,479
seen in passing.

44
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,120
Don't!

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,199
So what if you burned this lantern?

46
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,680
He'd never force me,

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
imprison me,

48
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,599
or humiliate me

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,599
like you do.

50
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,400
In my heart,

51
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,960
he's a hundred,
a thousand times better than you.

52
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,240
Shen Qingtang!

53
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,719
Let go of me.

54
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,840
You call this forcing, imprisoning?

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,719
Not love?

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
This isn't love.

57
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,759
You turned the sleeve dart he gave you

58
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:25,039
into a weapon to hurt me.

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,759
As long as I live,

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
don't even think of marrying him.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,560
Miss,

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
regarding your registry,

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,919
since Madam Jiang has long been devout,

64
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,319
we must draw lots in the ancestral hall

65
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,319
and report to ancestors for approval.

66
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,240
Caiwei,

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,719
I keep feeling uneasy.

68
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,920
Then let's visit
the ancestral hall to pray,

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,920
and seek peace of mind.

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
Miss, this...

71
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,580
(Ominous)

72
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,720
Well...

73
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,060
(Ominous)

74
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,300
(Ominous)

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,600
Seems someone

76
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,519
doesn't want a lucky lot drawn tomorrow.

77
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,590
I've already replaced the lot message.

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,700
As long as you cooperate,

79
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,930
the registry will be nullified.

80
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,279
(Pei Congzhi's mother, Jiang Wan)
Why should I let you have your way?

81
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,360
The daughter you protected,

82
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,279
the one you let grow up
carefree, Pei Ziqi,

83
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,680
what if she knew

84
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,360
she's the illegitimate child
you birthed in secret?

85
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,800
You think she'll like it?

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,690
Before entering the palace as a consort,

87
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,279
if this gets exposed,

88
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,000
what do you think will happen?

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,839
You're just like your ill-fated father,

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,800
despicable and shameless.

91
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,800
A venomous woman like you

92
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,720
is just a perfect match for us.

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,439
Do you think

94
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,319
I'm still that fool

95
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,480
who bent over backward

96
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,920
just to get your attention?

97
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,800
If Pei Yu hadn't forced himself
on me back then,

98
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,190
how would I have been
separated from my lover?

99
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,940
If it weren't for
being pregnant with you,

100
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,090
how would I have spent my life
trapped in this prison?

101
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,190
Your father and you ruined me,

102
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,990
so don't think
you'll have it easy either.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
In the Pei Manor,

104
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,519
no one will know peace.

105
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,120
What right does Pei Ziqi have

106
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,480
to live untouched and well?

107
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,639
Mutual torment,

108
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,279
a fate worse than death.

109
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,839
Isn't this what you're best at?

110
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,639
This is merely retribution.

111
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,040
Do you think

112
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,439
she'll love you or be grateful

113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
for all you've done?

114
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,199
With all your schemes
to keep her trapped,

115
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,240
she'll only hate you.

116
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,360
In my eyes,

117
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,120
she's the next me.

118
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,279
Mother, rest assured.

119
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,319
I won't be like father.

120
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,000
And she

121
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,319
will never be like you.

122
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,879
Just now,

123
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,759
I saw you coming from
outside Jiang Wan's room.

124
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,399
You heard everything?

125
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,240
What I saw and heard today,

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,240
I won't tell anyone.

127
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,319
In exchange,

128
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,199
I hope you won't

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
interfere with tomorrow's registry.

130
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,759
Shen Qingtang,

131
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,279
why would you choose an outsider

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,399
but refuse to love me even a little?

133
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,790
Because I could never
fall in love with a patricidal demon.

134
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,759
So I'm a terrifying demon?

135
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,319
But Shen Qingtang,

136
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,639
have you forgotten?

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,000
At age 15,

138
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,040
you helped me scheme together

139
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,439
to become a demon.

140
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,839
Let me help you.

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,639

Quick, save him!

Hurry! Someone help!
