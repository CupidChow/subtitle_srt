(Reflect on Righteousness)

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,280
(Xianxue Courtyard)

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,040
What do you want?

23
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,200
I want everyone who hurt me

24
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,159
to pay the price they deserve.

25
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,879
Xinglu's punishment isn't enough?

26
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,760
Then how about this?

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,040
Add the child in her womb.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,519
Is that enough?

29
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,640
Why pretend to be clueless?

30
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,480
You and I both know,

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
the one who truly wants me dead

32
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,120
is someone else.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,719
So blood makes the difference.

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,199
Only those who share
the same man-eating blood

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,919
can be considered family.

36
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,039
No matter how nice your words sound,

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,680
not a single thing

38
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,800
I want can be done.

39
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:24,960
In the future,

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,199
I'll make it up to you
with something else.

41
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,039
No need.

42
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,759
Because what I want

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,039
is something you can never give.

44
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,080
Shen Qingtang,

45
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,639
do you have to provoke me like this?

46
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,680
Yes.

47
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,759
You dragged me into the abyss,

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,910
and yet you dare expect me to love you,

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,890
to make you happy,
and to make things whole again?

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,240
You're hurt.

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Quick, go find me some medicine.

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
Don't die here.

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,439
If you want to die, go somewhere else.

54
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,159
Sorry to disappoint you.

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,080
These wounds

56
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,120
won't kill me.

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,080
Miss,

58
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,479
Madam Pei is here to see you.

59
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,120
You must leave.

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
She mustn't see you.

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,120
Go, now.

62
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,520
I won't.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,039
Greetings, Grandmother.

64
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,280
I know Congzhi protects you,

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,120
but the West Courtyard has
already been punished.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,400
You should persuade Congzhi

67
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,919
not to pursue this any further.

68
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,680
What's wrong?

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,759
I'm fine.

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,360
I just caught a cold yesterday,

71
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,360
so my legs ache a bit.

72
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,199
But I'm alright now, Grandmother.

73
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,120
Rest early.

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,879
Another day, I'll invite
the court physician to take a look.

75
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,600
Thank you, Grandmother.

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,720
Leave.

77
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,319
My injury is too severe. I can't move.

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,279
I'll stay here for the night.

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,439
Pei Congzhi.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,600
Don't move.

81
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,319
Just like this.

82
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,240
Just one night.

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,319
(Even if we share the same bed now,)

84
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,279
(our hearts remain separated.)

85
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,600
(What use is it?)

86
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,620
(Xianxue Courtyard)

87
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
If you're awake, leave now.

88
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,160
You may not care about shame,
but I still do.

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,519
Looks like the wound
doesn't hurt enough.

90
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,830
What are you trying to do now?

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,879
The promise I made
last night still holds.

92
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,600
I don't want to lose
the only family I've left.

93
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,279
What else do you wish for?

94
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,759
Once you know,

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,079
tell me anytime.

96
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,839
I want to return to Lingchuan,

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,660
to live carefree
like I did before eight,

98
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,600
before coming to the capital.

99
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,839
With or without you,

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,879
I'd be content.

101
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,279
Another wish that can't be granted.

102
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,600
Forget it.

103
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,079
Go.

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,560
Let me think.

105
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,000
Yanshu.

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,040
Yes.

107
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,600
Tell me, if one day I resign from office

108
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,759
and live as a civilian,

109
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,240
what would you think?

110
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:35,920
What?

111
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,879
Young Master,

112
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,639
you can't be serious.

113
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,360
The court can't do
without a pillar like you.

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,360
The Pei family needs you to prosper.

115
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,600
How can you leave?

116
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,759
Just joking.

117
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,190
What about the matter
I instructed you to do?

118
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,720
The Tianshui Lane affair is settled.

119
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,079
Just as you suspected,

120
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,879
though Lord Pingnan has left,

121
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,360
he's left many spies in the city
waiting for a chance to infiltrate.

122
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,000
It's all handled.

123
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,800
He won't grow suspicious.

124
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,199
Lord Pingnan holds power

125
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,959
and harbors ambition.

126
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,879
His true goal is the treasure clue
hidden on Shen Qingtang.

127
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,990
Find someone reliable to watch over her.

128
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,240
Don't let her leave here.

129
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,800
Yes.

130
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,040
At least in this Pei Manor,

131
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,879
I can keep her safe.

132
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,240
Heavens be praised!

133
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,200
It's cleared up.

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,679
What happened?

135
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,790
The new courtesan at Tianshui Lane
paraded through the streets.

136
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,480
They say

137
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,039
she looks exactly like you.

138
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,799
Now everyone's saying

139
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,879
someone must've mistaken her

140
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,399
for you before.

141
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,320
Now your name can finally be cleared.

142
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,039
A storm of rumors vanishes overnight.

143
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,840
Only he could've done that.

144
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,440
Was it Eldest Young Master?

145
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,080
Seems like he really does

146
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,120
care about you, Miss.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,879
No matter what,

148
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,759
with him wrapping up
the Tianshui Lane affair,

149
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,360
you no longer need to worry.

150
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,960
That's good news, isn't it?

151
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,799
Miss, aren't you happy?

152
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,039
I am.

153
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,600
(Pei Congzhi,)

154
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,039
(am I just a puppet in your hands?)

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,990

and even life or death)

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,960
(How can I break free from this fate?)

158
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,190
If it weren't for
grandmother's birthday,

159
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
I wouldn't have set off sky lanterns.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,279
How have you been in the palace lately?

161
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,679
You still care to ask?

162
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,230
Even though I'm in the palace,

163
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,490
I've heard you lost your engagement
to Prince Yan Cheng

164
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,840
because of those rumors.

165
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,639
Today,

166
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,480
our brother pleaded with Crown Prince

167
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,279
so I could return home to visit

168
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,639
and talk with you.

169
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
Our brother treats you very well.

170
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
Later, you better write more lines

171
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,000
