21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,439
Qingtang, please wait.

22
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,079
It was my fault today.

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,380
It was due to my lack of skill.

24
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,959
I have excellent medicine here.

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,550
You may take it to heal your injury.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
If you insist on seeing him,

27
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,400
I don't mind letting him come up

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,000
and take a look at our intimacy.

29
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,200
Cheng,

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm fine.

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,560
You should head back.

32
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,799
Then take care.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,799
I'll visit you another day.

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
If you're feeling unwell,

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,199
why not

36
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,000
let me be your remedy?

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,599
You're truly chaste.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,250
You're willing to hurt yourself,

39
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,759
but not let me touch you.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,840
My heart belongs to Prince Yan Cheng.

41
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,159
I'll marry no one but him in this life.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,240
Shen Qingtang,

43
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,400
today I can refrain from touching you.

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
But remember this,

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,080
in this lifetime,

46
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,759
you can only marry me.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,199
Pei Congzhi,

48
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,479
we're siblings.

49
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,879
How can you...

50
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,800
I can.

51
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,400
And

52
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,919
I will.

53
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:13,879
Miss.

54
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,520
More ice.

55
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,599
Miss, please don't scare me.

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,800
What exactly did
the Eldest Young Master do to you?

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
(Pei Congzhi,)

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,560
(you're far more terrifying
than Pei Jingming.)

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,759
(I must leave the Pei Manor,)

60
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,759
(and escape your control.)

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,680
Young Master,

62
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,840
the men we sent out have returned.

63
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,439
Miss Qingtang's background
is indeed as she claimed.

64
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,990
She's truly from a incense-making
family in Lingchuan.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Her parents both died in the plague.

66
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,960
If that's all there is,

67
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,960
then why does Lord Pingnan
keep investigating her in secret?

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,120
Even pushing her toward Yan Cheng?

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,439
Even if we must dig up graves

70
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,639
and question bones,
we must uncover the truth.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,680
No one else can be allowed

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,599
to approach her.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,479
Yes.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,399
Greetings, Your Highness.

75
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,920
I heard you suffered
a great shock yesterday

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,959
in the martial arena,

77
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,639
and now left with a scar.

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
I've been terribly worried,

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
so I invited you to the palace.

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,600
Thank you for your concern.

81
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,839
It's just a minor injury.

82
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm fine now.

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,000
How can it be minor?

84
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,000
A girl bearing a scar

85
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,480
is a grave matter.

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
It's so unsightly.

87
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,560
I recently received
some exotic tribute flowers.

88
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,040
Their dew is said to work wonders

89
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,519
on burn scars.

90
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,040
But the dew loses effect once extracted.

91
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,519
Let me apply it for you myself.

92
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:11,639
Your Highness,

93
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,560
my injury is truly fine now.

94
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,120
Your Highness...

95
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,199
This may sting,

96
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,439
but for full recovery,

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,439
endure it.

98
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,759
Your Highness.

99
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,759
Alright, you may rise.

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,360
There, Qingtang.

101
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,800
I hope this dew proves effective.

102
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,360
Thank you,

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
Your Highness.

104
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,759
Guards!

105
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,319
Guards!

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,470
Princess Zhaohe has developed a rash

107
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,000
and she can't see anyone

108
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,240
You did this?

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,319
Hurt the enemy while also harm yourself.

110
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,639
Do you realize Zhaohe isn't like Xinglu?

111
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,590
If word spreads to the Eastern Palace,

112
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,160
do you have enough lives to lose?

113
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,240
Being unseen for half a month

114
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,079
is worth it.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
Rest assured, Congzhi.

116
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,600
This time I was

117
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,879
even more discreet than last.

118
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,519
Because I'm adopted

119
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,120
and of lowly status,

120
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,720
she can insult and humiliate me at will.

121
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,639
If I must always endure and dodge,

122
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,319
I'm unwilling.

123
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,120
So this is simply

124
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,199
using her own means

125
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,199
against her.

126
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,879
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

127
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,759
I can't afford the price

128
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,519
of asking for your help.

129
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,580
As long as you're willing to speak up,

130
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,079
I'll do it for you.

131
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,160
Anything,

132
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,079
I can make it happen.

133
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,200
(But Congzhi,)

134
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,320
(you still don't understand.)

135
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,080
(I'm not your pampered bird
or dependent.)

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,679
(I can achieve)

137
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,039
(what I want on my own,)

138
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,159
(not by relying on others)

139
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,120
(and being shackled.)

140
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,759
Your hand is fine.

141
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,919
How about your legs? Your feet?

142
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,159
I'm alright.

143
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,879
Let me see.

144
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
Cheng,

145
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,240
I'm truly fine.

146
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,480
The wounds are all healed.

147
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,120
As long as you're alright.

148
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,120
It's all my fault,
putting you through fear and danger.

149
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:08,879
I...

150
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,120
That day wasn't your fault.

151
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,750
You don't need to blame yourself, Cheng.

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,279
You really don't blame me?

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,850
Then I'm relieved.

154
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,360
Lately, I haven't been sleeping well.

155
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,950
I keep thinking of coming to see you.

156
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,360
Last time you said you loved
the desert's wild scenery,

157
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,919
so I had this made for you.

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,970
With it by your side,

159
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,960
maybe it'll cheer you up.

160
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,600
Here.

161
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,039
Wind chases stars,
casting fleeting shadows.

162
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,399
Hooves race lightning,
silent in their flight.

163
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,399
How wonderful it'd be

164
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,610
if I could be as free as them.

165
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,559
Thank you, Cheng.

166
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,919
I truly

167
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,080
love this lantern.

168
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm glad you do.

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,120
From now on, whatever you like,

170
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,279
I'll find it for you.

171
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,080
Madam Pei, previously,

172
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,320
you only hoped for Miss Ziqi
to marry into the palace.

173
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
But now Miss Shen

174
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,279
seems rather different from before.

175
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,360
She's truly a good girl
raised by our Pei Manor.

176
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,480
No wonder she caught
the eye of the prince.

177
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,960
If we really secure this engagement,

178
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,559
it'll also benefit Congzhi in court.

179
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,919
But Miss Shen's family background

180
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,679
can never be changed.

181
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,399
Will Lord Pingnan truly agree?

182
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,399
When Congzhi's father was alive,

183
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,639
our two families were close.

184
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,919
Now that you've returned to the capital,

185
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,600
we ought to renew

186
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,720
and strengthen that bond.

187
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,000
My father also instructed me as such,

188
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
so I've been visiting often lately.

189
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,799
I hope you don't find it a bother.

190
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,590
Among the young people in our manor,

191
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,080
Qingtang is the most obedient.

192
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,000
Now that she's come of age,

193
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,320
Madam Pei is planning

194
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,240
to register her under
Madam Jiang's name

195
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,320
and raise her status,

196
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,200
so she may be married off
as the legitimate daughter.

197
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:16,879
Grandmother.

198
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,720
Madam Pei, why consider others?

199
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,039
I've long admired Qingtang
and wish to protect her all my life.

200
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
If you agree,

201
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,080
I'll ask my parents
to come propose marriage at once.

202
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,840
If that's the case,

203
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,679
I'm reassured.

204
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,480
This is a fine match indeed.

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,480
What do you think, Qingtang?

206
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,519
In matters of marriage,

207
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,639
I'll follow
your arrangement, grandmother.

208
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,559
Cheng,

209
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,320
what you just said,

210
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,120
do you truly mean it?

211
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,440
Of course I do.

212
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,190
Since we reunited at the palace gates,

213
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,960
I fell for you at first sight.

214
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,159
As for me,

215
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,879
once I've set my heart on someone,

216
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,879
I remain true till death.

217
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,960
If you feel the same,

218
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520
I'll give you everything I have.

219
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,919
Grandmother's wish

220
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,039
is also my wish.

221
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:24,919
Really?

222
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,080
Qingtang,

223
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
I'll never fail you.

224
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,120
Young Master,

225
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,960
today Prince Yan Cheng
visited Miss Shen again.

226
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,919
He even had lunch with Madam Pei.

227
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,850
What does grandmother mean by this?

228
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,600
Madam Pei plans to register Miss Shen

229
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,039
under Madam Jiang's name,

230
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,559
making her your sister by blood

231
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,559
to pair her with Prince Yan Cheng.

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,730
You've always loved
Miss Qingtang the most.

233
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,410
Now that she's rid
of Second Young Master,

234
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,200
and might marry into

235
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,480
such a noble household,

236
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,039
it's surely a blessing.

237
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,360
Qingtang

238
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,159
doesn't need to marry anyone else.

239
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,159
I'll marry her.

240
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,960
But it seems she herself

241
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,039
has already agreed to the arrangement.
