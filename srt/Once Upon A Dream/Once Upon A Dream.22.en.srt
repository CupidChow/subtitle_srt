21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,519
Caiwei,

22
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,280
the young master
who escorted me home today

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,879
is just like the one in my dreams.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,439
Is that so?

25
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,200
That's wonderful!

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,400
Perhaps it's what they call

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,599
a match made in heaven.

28
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,239
Miss, you've reached
the age of marriage.

29
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,959
You must seize this opportunity.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,560
I...

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,439
If that's the case,
there should be mutual gestures.

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,680
Miss, why don't you strike
while the iron is hot

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
and gift him this sachet

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,079
to show your gratitude?

35
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,360
Cong...

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Chief Minister,

37
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,990
what are you doing here?

38
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,199
Aren't you here too?

39
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,360
It seems our intentions
in coming to Lingchuan

40
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,759
are the same.

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Lord Pingnan raised arms in rebellion,

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
committing heinous crimes.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,560
You,

44
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,680
as the sole surviving bloodline

45
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,039
of Lord Pingnan,

46
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,639
should keep a low profile, right?

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,879
By low profile,

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,960
do you mean that someone of my identity

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
and Qingtang,
someone who has a sensitive background,

50
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,080
shouldn't meet again?

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,240
What else?

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
Originally, my father's crimes

53
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,919
were enough to implicate his family.

54
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,520
If not for you, a loyal minister,

55
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,550
who interceded and pleaded in court
on our behalf,

56
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,400
our lineage

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,439
would've long been eradicated.

58
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,759
I wouldn't be standing here today,

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,759
talking to you like old times.

60
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,039
Congzhi,

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,199
in this matter,

62
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,400
I owe you a lifelong debt.

63
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,639
But gratitude has its proper form.

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,280
I absolutely won't give up
on pursuing Qingtang

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,919
because of this favor.

66
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,560
Now,

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,479
I'm a commoner,

68
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,840
forever barred from holding office.

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,350
As for Qingtang's secret identity,

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
I believe under your protection,

71
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,919
it'll remain hidden forever.

72
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,439
For me, to rekindle
the past with Qingtang

73
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,120
is actually more righteous than you.

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,439
Don't you realize you're courting death?

75
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,560
If my death

76
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,919
could earn Qingtang's true heart,

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,840
so be it.

78
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
But Congzhi,

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
did you know?

80
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,240
You've lived too arrogantly and freely.

81
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,280
You never learned
how to truly love someone.

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,879
You hurt her deeply before.

83
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,120
Now,

84
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,439
I won't so easily

85
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,519
let her fall back into that abyss.

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,560
I've never learned

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,680
how to truly love someone?

88
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,000
But who ever taught me?

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
Shen Qingtang.

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,560
Young Master, you know me?

91
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,519
May I ask who you are?

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
I'm your new neighbor next door,

93
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,879
surname Pei.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,000
I may have startled you just now.

95
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,439
Please forgive me.

96
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
I heard about you from Caiwei.

97
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,480
She said the medicines I take

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,879
were all prepared by you.

99
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,880
You haven't even charged us
for many of them.

100
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,319
By that logic, I'm in your debt.

101
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,360
Thank you, Young Master.

102
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,279
Just a few herbal concoctions,
not worth much.

103
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,600
I heard

104
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,560
you're very skilled at making incense.

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,290
In the future,

106
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,560
a few sachets in return would be enough.

107
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,600
Sure.

108
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,500
I think the one in your hand
looks quite nice.

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,480
This one...

110
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,160
This way,

111
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,319
we'll call it even.

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Pei...

113
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,480
Young Master Pei,

114
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,839
Miss Qingtang isn't home.

115
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,079
Not home?

116
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,839
Then that person in the yard is a ghost?

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,000
Smell this.

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
What I meant by not home

119
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,560
is to ask you to give her some peace.

120
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,839
You're just neighbors.

121
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,959
Don't get in the way

122
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,360
of her connection
with Young Master Yan Cheng.

123
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,839
Young Master Pei, this is...

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
When I went up the mountain today,
I picked a few extra herbs.

125
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,790
Thinking that incense and medicine
share a source,

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,399
perhaps you might find use for them.

127
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,199
So I brought them over.

128
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,079
Go away.

129
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,759
You'll see.

130
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,970
Thank you, Young Master Pei.

131
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,500
I wonder if you've heard the saying,

132
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,550
"Don't do unto others
what you don't wish for yourself."

133
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,959
I didn't read much. I haven't.

134
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,639
But Doctor Pei, you look like a man

135
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,079
of great knowledge and learning.

136
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,160
I'd think you'd understand.

137
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,360
And you look like a typical warrior.

138
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,550
Does that mean you were born
knowing how to butcher pigs?

139
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,079
You...

140
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,790
Young Master Yan really doesn't
have the sharpest tongue.

141
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,460
Since childhood,

142
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,990
he's never won a single verbal spar
against my young master.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
That's called having a childlike heart.

144
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,759
Unlike your master,

145
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,560
who lies without batting an eye.

146
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,050
Our young master has a brilliant mind.

147
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,160
I heard you caught a cold.

148
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,160
Feeling any better?

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,319
Much better now.

150
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,560
Thank you for your concern.

151
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,439
You dropped this the other night.

152
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,360
I've been looking everywhere
for this lately.

153
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,439
So it was with you.

154
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,370
How should I thank you this time,
Young Master Pei?

155
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,879
No need for formalities.

156
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,279
I think

157
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,000
I might be a little older than you.

158
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,990
Why not call me Brother Congzhi,

159
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,560
just like you call him?

160
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,959
Alright.

161
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,680
Brother Congzhi.

162
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,320
Sister.

163
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,600
- Brother?
- What?

164
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,200
Brother Congzhi.

165
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,519
Qingtang,

166
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,879
accepting gifts

167
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,279
requires reciprocation.

168
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,000
These herbs are common on Mount Wutou.

169
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,039
I'll take you to gather some tomorrow.

170
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,000
Sure.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,399
Young Master Yan is such a good man.

172
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,080
Brother Congzhi.

173
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:56,840
What's wrong?

174
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,490
Brother Congzhi.

175
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,400
In the end,
Young Master Yan will surely win.

176
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,879
Brother Congzhi.

177
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:12,919
Sister.

178
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,840
How strange.

179
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,600
Why does my heart always race

180
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,120
whenever I think of him?

181
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
Miss, what's the matter?

182
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
Caiwei,

183
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,399
between Young Master Pei
and Young Master Yan,

184
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,480
who do you think is better?

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,519
Miss,

186
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,039
why are you picking between them now?

187
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,000
Of course Young Master Yan,
who protected you,

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,000
is the better choice.

189
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,080
Caiwei,

190
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,000
why do I feel like

191
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,519
you've always disliked Young Master Pei?

192
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,240
But he's been very kind to me too.

193
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,559
Miss,

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,600
there are people in this world
who are kind to you

195
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,279
without expecting anything in return,

196
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,080
like Young Master Yan.

197
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,919
In my humble opinion,

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,000
his sincere feelings for you

199
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,200
are what true love looks like.

200
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,039
Young Master Pei may be dashing,

201
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,320
but every kindness he gives

202
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,990
always seems to require
double the thanks.

203
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,480
Ah, so that's what you mean.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,919
He does have a bit of that tendency.

205
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,200
But I always find myself

206
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,770
wanting to give something back to him.

207
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,120
That's odd, isn't it?

208
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,720
Miss,

209
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,720
you owe him nothing.

210
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,679
Please, take my advice.

211
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Young Master Yan

212
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,639
is the better match.
