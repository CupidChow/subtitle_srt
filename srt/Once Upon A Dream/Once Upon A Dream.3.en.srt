00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,040
Qingtang.

22
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,079
Qingtang!

23
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,359
You had me so worried.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
When the manor caught fire,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,079
I was with mother at Wang'an Temple.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
(Third Lady of the Pei family, Pei Ziqi)
I wasn't able to look after you.

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,640
Are you all right?

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,799
I'm fine.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,680
A few days of rest and I've recovered.

30
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,359
That's great!

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,280
There's a Mid-Autumn banquet
at the palace tonight.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,200
Come with me for a breath of fresh air.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,200
I seldom leave this courtyard.

34
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,120
I'd better not.

35
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,719
Please, Qingtang.

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,200
The palace banquet

37
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,560
is actually a match-making event
for noble families.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,400
All the talented young men
in the capital will be there.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
Many girls hope to find
a good match tonight.

40
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,080
But aside from the Crown Prince,

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,360
I don't know anyone.

42
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,800
That Congzhi is just a poker face.

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,639
He only nags about my studies,

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,039
never my happiness.

45
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,560
Come with me, Qingtang.

46
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,439
Then tell me first,

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,159
which noble men will be attending?

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,879
Let me think.

49
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,879
Prince Yan Cheng
from the Lord Pingnan Manor

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,599
is truly elegant and handsome,

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,960
remarkably refined.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Other than Chief Minister Pei,

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,790
there's no one in Heng Kingdom

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,479
who can compare to him.

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,800
It's Cheng!

56
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,439
Cheng has returned from the frontier.

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,479
You stud.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,039
(Prince Yan Cheng)
Let me see what kind of person

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,439
(Prince Yan Cheng)
could make you act so shamelessly.

60
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,919
Cheng, you're here too!

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,280
Yes.

62
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,760
Watch your step, Qingtang.

63
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,800
Cheng.

64
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,000
Ziqi.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,879
This is...

66
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,080
Did a trip to the frontier

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,639
make you forget Qingtang?

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,599
When we were kids, you caught bugs

69
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,879
and scared her to tears.

70
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,810
You've forgotten?

71
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Greetings, Prince Yan Cheng.

72
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,719
I remember now.

73
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,800
The little shadow
who used to trail after Congzhi,

74
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,639
that crybaby.

75
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,879
I didn't expect

76
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,759
you'd grow up to be
as lovely as a fairy.

77
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,800
I was immature back then

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,759
and frightened you.

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,120
Please don't take it to heart.

80
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,519
Not at all.

81
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,690
The palace banquet is about to start.
Let's hurry inside.

82
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,600
Let's go.

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,639
I'll go with you.

84
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,439
I'm terribly sorry
to offend Your Highness.

85
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,519
I was anxious to find someone.
You may go.

86
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,399
Yes.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,920
Your Highness,

88
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,639
your chest is wet.

89
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,399
Your Highness.

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,319
Qingtang, no need to be so distant.

91
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,600
Just like when we were kids,

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
call me Cheng.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,839
Cheng.

94
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,079
Life must've been hard

95
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,920
at the frontier these years.

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,720
A man serving his country
at the frontier isn't hardship.

97
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,439
Besides, the frontier is far more
interesting than the capital,

98
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,000
and the scenery is grand.

99
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,000
Really?

100
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,839
I rarely get to leave home,

101
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,480
let alone travel to the frontier.

102
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,319
It sounds so exciting.

103
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,360
If you like,

104
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,199
I'll visit the Pei Manor
when I have time

105
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,839
and tell you all about it.

106
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,079
All right.

107
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,000
I dirtied your handkerchief.

108
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,160
I'll clean it and return it
to you next time.

109
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,199
It's a promise.

110
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,600
Sure.

111
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,060
(Princess Zhaohe)

112
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,959
So here you are.

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,959
You had me searching high and low.

114
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,199
What now?

115
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,439
The mighty Chief Minister

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,639
has to watch his sister

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,920
get close to another man,

118
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,480
but is unable to approach her?

119
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,370
You're mistaken, Your Highness.

120
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,160
I was merely watching

121
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,120
the clouds veil the moon.

122
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,040
If you feel nothing,

123
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,199
then I shall ask my brother

124
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,439
to arrange a marriage
between Prince Yan Cheng and Qingtang.

125
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,920
She'll surely be delighted.

126
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,000
This is our family's business.

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,560
No need to trouble Your Highness.

128
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,160
I can't bear to see anyone wronged.

129
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,360
I insist on helping.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,199
What can you do to stop me?

131
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,839
She's my sister.

132
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,839
As her brother, I'll protect her.

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,839
You may shield her for now,

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,480
but do you think
you can protect her forever?

135
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,959
Then let's see.

136
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,879
Pei Congzhi.

137
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,800
Have you forgotten
our engagement my father granted?

138
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,319
A fallen noble girl from Lingchuan,
or a royal princess,

139
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,439
don't tell me you can't decide.

140
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,759
The one who can't decide

141
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,399
is Your Highness.

142
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,590
I still have matters to attend to
and will take my leave.

143
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,839
Qingtang,

144
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,480
this place is stifling.

145
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,839
Why don't we go to the garden
and catch up?

146
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,560
I'll tell you more about the desert.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,519
All right.

148
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,759
I'll wait for you in the courtyard.

149
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
(At this point,)

150
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,319
(marrying up)

151
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,240
(might be the only way out.)

152
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,240
Shen Qingtang,

153
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,839
so your plan

154
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,040
is to seduce another man outside?

155
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,680
Relying on my indulgence,

156
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,399
you've become more brazen.

157
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,519
So,

158
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,480
you'd rather seek help from others

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,480
than yield to me?

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,720
What exactly are you after?

161
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,519
At the age of marriage,

162
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,799
what more could I seek

163
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,039
but a man to marry?

164
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,879
Marriage?

165
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,080
Did I give you permission?

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,080
With me here, why look elsewhere?

167
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,720
And if you don't permit it?

168
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,879
Will you break off your engagement

169
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,039
to Princess Zhaohe for me?

170
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,600
See?

171
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,279
You can't even decide your own marriage.

172
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,120
Why force mine?

173
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,200
And if I insist?

174
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Shen Qingtang,

175
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,759
I'm in love with you.

176
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,919
What does that have to do
with my marriage?

177
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,960
So,

178
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,000
you claim to love me

179
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,679
but won't give me a proper title,

180
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,240
is that it?

181
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,919
Do you care?

182
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,080
I don't.

183
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,879
Have I ever had the right

184
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,279
to care?

185
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,639
Marriage is no trifling matter.

186
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,070
It requires careful consideration.

187
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,399
And also,

188
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,360
Prince Yan Cheng isn't a good match.

189
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
From today on,

190
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,039
you aren't to associate with him.

191
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,560
Lord Pingnan has just
returned to the capital.

192
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,399
He plans to find a noble lady

193
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,919
in the capital for his son
Yan Cheng to marry.

194
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
What Lord Pingnan seeks

195
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,519
is far from simple.

196
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,440
I feel an instant connection
with Prince Yan Cheng.

197
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,879
I'll marry him.

198
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,360
Shen Qingtang,

199
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,759
why don't you shout it louder?

200
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,600
Tell your so-called soulmate the truth

201
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,799
about what's between us now?

202
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,600
You...

203
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,879
You...

204
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,879
Go back.
