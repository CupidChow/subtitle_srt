=Once Upon A Dream=

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,340
(Adapted from Luanjing's novel
"Bird in a Cage")

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,500
=Episode 7=
(Nightmare Awakens)

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,280
But Shen Qingtang, don't forget.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,560
At age 15,

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
you helped me destroy the corpse,
erase the evidence,

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,599
and spun that monstrous lie.

25
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,840
I was your accomplice,

26
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,439
but that was my instinct to survive.

27
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,239
Back then,

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
you clearly had the intent
to kill me too.

29
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,439
If I hadn't done what I did,

30
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,959
could I have survived to this day?

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,719
I entered the manor as an orphan,

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,590
with no one to rely on since childhood.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,640
I had to keep my head down,

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,120
cautiously observing and pleasing

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
everyone in the household.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,120
I knew what kind of person you were,

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,920
but I was timid,

38
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,319
cowardly,

39
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,840
unable to resist.

40
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,159
I could only obey,

41
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,879
and be a compliant little sister.

42
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,280
I've truly had enough

43
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,280
of living in such constant fear.

44
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,439
I once thought,

45
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,360
by bearing the consequences
of that sin with me,

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,960
and getting to know my disgraceful side,

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,639
you'd be able to accept me.

48
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,439
Since we shared life

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,680
and death at 15,

50
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,800
you've long ceased to be
just a sister in my heart.

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,159
But now you tell me

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,759
you've hated me all this time.

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
Shen Qingtang,

54
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,360
you could've deceived me
your whole life.

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Why say it out loud and court death?

56
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,319
If this matter has caused you confusion,

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,840
then today I'll make it clear.

58
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,719
There will never be love between us.

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,439
Shen Qingtang,

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,439
you betrayed me time and again,

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,960
forcing me to coerce you.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,919
How many chances must I give you

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,110
before you finally surrender to fate?

64
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,879
Your heart is already full of wounds,

65
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,439
and I've walked this road
as if treading on thin ice.

66
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,879
People like us

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
are incapable of loving each other.

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,919
We might as well let go,

69
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,400
alright?

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,840
You wouldn't still think

71
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,599
you're qualified to marry, would you?

72
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,800
The scent of rain-soaked branches

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,039
of crabapple flowers.

74
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,560
Are you still familiar with it?

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,039
That dream...

76
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,080
Do you still remember?

77
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,240
When did I first

78
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,600
appear in your dreams?

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,519
A month ago,

80
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,600
on the road to Wang'an Temple,

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,800
we stayed at the same inn.

82
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,319
Miss,

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,319
(One month ago)
this side room is tucked away deep.

84
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,959
(One month ago)
There may be quite a few mosquitoes.

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,890
I'll ask the innkeeper
to bring the mosquito-repelling incense.

86
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,759
Alright.

87
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,000
Let the servant know
and then get some rest.

88
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,759
Once the incense arrives,
I'll light it myself.

89
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,759
Okay.

90
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,879
What you didn't know was,

91
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,680
in the room across from you,

92
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,639
my mother was secretly

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
meeting her lover.

94
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,240
Yes.

95
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,720
She too asked the inn's servant

96
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,600
to fetch a kind of incense.

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,600
Such a potent drug.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,980
Guests these days really
do indulge themselves.

99
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,240
That night,

100
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,079
the servant delivered it
to the wrong room.

101
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,759
Miss, here's what you asked for.

102
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,000
I thought, with years
of experience in incense...

103
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,600
Thank you.

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,800
you'd notice.

105
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,160
It'd be fine.

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,720
So I chose not to interfere
in my mother's sordid affairs.

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,240
Never did I imagine

108
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,879
you failed to recognize it,

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,290
and were affected by the incense.

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,639
Help me...

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,439
So hot...

112
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,079
So sick...

113
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,800
Qingtang.

114
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,560
Help me...

115
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,279
Qingtang.

116
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,160
Help me...

117
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,399
I'll get you some water.

118
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,639
Please help me.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,680
Under the influence
of the incense, you...

120
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,439
The drug was too strong.

121
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,920
You weren't conscious,

122
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,560
and mistook that night

123
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,519
as just a dream.

124
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,000
Then we...

125
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,759
Did we already...?

126
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,759
You're so clever.

127
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,519
Why not take a guess?

128
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,759
Miss, are you painting
a mandarin duck or a canary?

129
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,790
Bound by love,
mandarin ducks perish together.

130
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,840
Birds in cages rot away.

131
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,559
What I paint

132
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,320
is a goose that can soar through sky.

133
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,240
Unfettered,

134
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,120
unburdened by the world.

135
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,590
Miss, the young master asked me
to give you this.

136
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,799
He hopes you'll collect yourself
and stop defying him.

137
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,600
Get lost!

138
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,080
Trying to blackmail
the Pei family with a lock?

139
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,279
With a single golden lock,

140
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,639
you think you can lock me for life?

141
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,639
Congzhi, I beg you, let me out.

142
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
It's all my fault.

143
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,600
I won't sneak out of the manor again.

144
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,440
Sneaking out behind my back,

145
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,690
and foolishly getting bitten by a snake.

146
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,159
If I don't let you suffer a little,

147
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,480
how will you learn?

148
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,519
Qingtang.

149
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,480
Prince Yan Cheng has come to propose.

150
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,440
What?

151
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,159
But right now,

152
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,470
I can no longer be a legitimate daughter
of the Pei family.

153
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,240
How could he...

154
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,120
Do you think I'd lie to you?

155
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,759
Just come with me.

156
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,279
This

157
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,159
is from mother.

158
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,840
She feels guilty
for drawing that cursed lot

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,679
and ruining your registry.

160
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,399
Please don't blame her.

161
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,440
This is the will of Heaven.

162
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,039
How could I blame Madam Jiang?

163
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,720
Today, the prince came to the manor.

164
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,200
I believe Heaven

165
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,799
still shows me a bit of mercy.

166
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,200
As long as you're sincere,
there will surely be a good match.

167
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,279
Let's go.

168
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,440
Madam Pei thought,

169
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,639
since it's such a perfect match,
why be bound by these formalities?

170
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,440
She's always regarded Miss Qingtang
as her own granddaughter.

171
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,080
In beauty and conduct,
she's no less than any noble lady.

172
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,120
In my eyes, Qingtang

173
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,879
surpasses all the women in the world.

174
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,639
Miss Ziqi will soon marry
into the palace as a consort.

175
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,960
Why not hold the wedding
of the prince and her

176
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,039
on the same day?

177
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,240
Two blossoms shining together
will double the joy.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,240
I'd be honored.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,240
I only wonder...

180
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,039
Good child.

181
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,559
I've finally

182
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,159
lived to see this day.

183
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,000
If your birth grandmother
were still alive,

184
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,960
how happy she'd be.

185
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,600
Marriage is a major affair.

186
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,480
Though grandmother
and the prince are willing,

187
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm now

188
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,000
the master of the Pei Manor.

189
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,400
♪Blazing peach blossoms gently fall♪

190
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
♪Petals land on my heart♪

191
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,680
♪Yet I seek them in vain♪

192
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,120
♪Letting the years secretly hide♪

193
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,960
♪All the recklessness and naivety♪

194
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,760
♪Looking back at the bustling world♪

195
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,880
♪Is it sorrow or joy,
or all turned to emptiness♪

196
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,360
♪Afraid of slipping through my fingers♪

197
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,880
♪Fate comes and goes, all so fleeting♪

198
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,400
♪In my eyes, is your face♪

199
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,360
♪I fear time is but a fleeting dream♪

200
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,960
♪A fool, deeply in love for whom♪

201
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,400
♪And why should peach blossoms
smile at the spring breeze♪
