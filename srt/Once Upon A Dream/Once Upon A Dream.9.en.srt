Your Highness.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,480
I'm here.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,719
It's alright now.

26
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,079
It's alright.

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,120
It's alright.

28
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,200
It's all my fault.

29
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,239
It's just that my fate is unfortunate.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,319
Prince Yan Cheng,

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,480
please don't seek me again
in the future.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,519
Just pretend we never met.

33
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,610
Do you blame me for not protecting you,

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,550
and making you suffer such humiliation?

35
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,479
Now that I've ended up
in a pleasure house,

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,439
my reputation is doomed.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm not worthy of you.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,159
Your Highness,

39
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,120
find someone

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
from a matching family background.

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,879
In my eyes,

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,879
you're the purest girl in the world.

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
A woman's virtue

44
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,879
is never beneath her dress.

45
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,439
Yan Cheng.

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,280
It's alright now.

47
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,240
What happened today,

48
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,660
if you don't wish to speak of it,

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,960
I'll never ask.

50
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,960
But I have only one thing to say.

51
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,760
As long as you hold me in your heart,

52
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll marry no one but you in this life.

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,080
It's alright now.

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,719
Pei Congzhi, how dare you hurt him?

55
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,759
Mother, how dare you lay hands
on the one I care about most?

56
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,960
Then I'll make you

57
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,800
pay a price you can't afford.

58
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,000
Your lover's life

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,039
is in my hands.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,439
You better watch yourself.

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,960
I'll make you lose
the one you love forever.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,080
If there's a next time,

63
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,919
the one who loses the beloved

64
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,960
will be you.

65
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,220
(Xianxue Courtyard)

66
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,040
It's good that you've come around.

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
To marry Prince Yan Cheng

68
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,639
is a blessing countless women
can only dream of.

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,160
Since he truly cares for you,
you should cherish him.

70
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,839
Don't miss such a good match
due to your low self-esteem.

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,879
I heard you went to Wang'an Temple

72
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,279
and changed routes midway,
catching a cold.

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,959
I'm fine now.

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,399
Take good care of yourself

75
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,800
so the marriage won't be affected.

76
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,839
I truly feel sorry for you.

77
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,560
But Lord Pingnan Manor
is a military family.

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,480
They don't care about status
like the others.

79
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,240
Marrying into their manor

80
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,519
is the best possible match for you.

81
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,800
(No one must know)

82
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,990
(I was abducted to
Tianshui Lane's pleasure house.)

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,279
(It'd affect the marriage.)

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,100
(Marrying into Lord Pingnan Manor)

85
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,519
(isn't just a good match.)

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,160
(It's also my path to escape this cage.)

87
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,079
I laid eyes on her first.

88
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,970
But grandmother allowed her

89
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,920
to marry an outsider.

90
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,639
Why?

91
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,639
Why?

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,120
You're still thinking of that wench?

93
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,439
What do you take me for?

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,399
You crazy woman.
What are you raving about?

95
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,279
You dare hit me for her?

96
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,680
I'll kill you, you mad woman!

97
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,920
That wench Shen Qingtang
is about to be married,

98
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,610
and she's still clinging
to Pei Jingming.

99
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,879
I'll definitely make her pay.

100
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,480
My husband works for Prince Yan Cheng.

101
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,480
He told me a juicy secret recently.

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,680
On her way to Wang'an Temple,

103
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,680
our Miss Shen was abducted
to the pleasure house.

104
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,319
It was Prince Yan Cheng himself

105
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,959
who led the rescue.

106
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,319
Stop talking nonsense.

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,959
If she really ended up in such a place,

108
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,680
how could the Lord Pingnan Manor
still send a betrothal gift?

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,839
Perhaps the prince was bewitched

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,759
by her charms.

111
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,790
The men I sent to Lingchuan
reported back.

112
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,639
Miss Qingtang's mother

113
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
didn't die of plague.

114
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,040
Her skull was struck,

115
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,400
and the bones were shattered.

116
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,439
The plague was merely to cover up
the truth of her death.

117
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,560
Moreover,

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
on Madam Shen's body,

119
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,639
we found this hairpin.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,639
It was indeed made
in the former dynasty.

121
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,279
It's said to belong to Consort Shu
of the former emperor.

122
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,480
Only one of its kind.

123
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,279
If before the former emperor's death,

124
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,879
he told Consort Shu where

125
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,759
the treasure was hidden,

126
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,100
then the reason why Lord Pingnan
secretly investigated Qingtang

127
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,040
and why he allowed Yan Cheng
to approach her

128
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,839
become clear.

129
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,839
Qingtang must

130
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,720
hold the clue to the treasure.

131
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,420
(Xianxue Courtyard)

132
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,800
Caiwei, help me wash.

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,730
What are you trying to do again?

134
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,759
What am I trying to do?

135
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,240
You can't do this.

136
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,079
Then how about this?

137
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,639
Pei Congzhi,

138
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,160
about the pleasure house,

139
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,839
I can let it go tonight.

140
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,439
But if you insist on
taking that step now,

141
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,040
I'll drag you down with me.

142
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:06,920
Tomorrow,

143
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,439
my betrothed is Yan Cheng,

144
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,240
not you.

145
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,800
Can that betrothed of yours

146
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,680
be as intimate with you as I am?

147
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,079
Like me,

148
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,439
who knows about the tattoo

149
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,519
hidden on your body?

150
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,560
Hidden?

151
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
You say hidden?

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,960
The tattoo has been there
since I was a child.

153
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,879
If we had truly been intimate,

154
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,320
how could you only notice it now?

155
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,480
Pei Congzhi, you lied to me.

156
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,519
If you only realize it now,

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,039
it's not too late.

158
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,600
- Help me.
- Shen Qingtang.

159
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,679
- Help me.

Help me.

162
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,919
the truth is...
