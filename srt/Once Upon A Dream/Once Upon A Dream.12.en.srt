(The Passing of Kin)

21
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,799
Miss, they're bullying us.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,359
Who bullied you?

23
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,200
I just feel sorry for you.

24
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,120
These past few days,

25
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,400
we've been visiting Madam Pei every day,

26
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,799
yet she refuses to see us.

27
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,680
And now they want to deduct
our monthly allowance.

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,799
How can anyone live like this?

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,680
Those rumors

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,200
weren't your fault.

31
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,159
Exactly.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,200
And Eldest Young Master

33
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,400
sent two gatekeepers over.

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,079
Does he not trust you either?

35
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,920
Does he not want you
to leave this courtyard?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,560
Caiwei,

37
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,280
if he hadn't sent someone over

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,680
to guard us,

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,319
who knows when the news

40
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,360
would spread about my suicide?

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,759
Miss,

42
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,680
let's leave the Pei Manor.

43
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,240
If only it were that easy.

44
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,199
(Pei Congzhi,)

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
(you sent people to guard me)

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,800
(so I can't die.)

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,159
(But you offer no help beyond that.)

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
(Are you waiting)

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,680
(for me to bow my head and beg you?)

50
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,919
Caiwei,

51
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,960
I want to make a batch

52
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,439
of the Sinking Fish Incense
for better sleep.

53
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,950
Do you still have the ingredients?

54
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,639
Yes,

55
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,960
there's plenty.

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,840
Good.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,439
Then let's go all in

58
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,039
and use it all.

59
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,220
(Cliff)

60
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,960
Caiwei, tie them up
and put them in the side room.

61
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,000
Then spread the word

62
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,159
that our Xianxue Courtyard
has been completely abandoned

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
by the head of the Pei family.

64
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,140
(Xianxue Courtyard)

65
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,240
You can't come in here.

66
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,479
What are you doing?

67
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,960
Xinglu!

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,599
Xinglu!

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Miss!

70
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,680
Xinglu, what are you doing?

71
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,319
Insolence!

72
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,920
You're nothing but a disgrace
to the family.

73
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,279
How dare you

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,759
say my name?

75
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,220
I'm a lady of the Pei family.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Why can't say it?

77
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,399
With your ruined self,

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,879
you've long been

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
a plaything for many.

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,040
You still think you're the lady
of the Pei family?

81
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
Petals in your bath.

82
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,990
Pei Jingming gave them to you, right?

83
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,439
I think you just

84
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,480
want to cling to the Pei Manor,

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,079
using your filthy body

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
to seduce more men and rise again.

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,290
If Pei Jingming wishes to be kind to me
when I'm down,

88
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,439
that's his business.

89
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,800
Whether or not you can control your man
is yours.

90
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,720
But I won't leave.

91
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,639
If you won't leave,

92
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,439
then I'll help you.

93
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,199
What are you trying to do?

94
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,839
Shen Qingtang,

95
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,959
today I've arranged a fine show for you.

96
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
The adopted girl of the Pei family
loses her chastity,

97
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,959
and out of shame
drinks herself into a stupor,

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,319
then drowns in a bath tub.

99
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,000
Let people taint you while you're alive,

100
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,759
and let them feast their eyes
even in your death.

101
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,160
I came today under Madam Pei's order.

102
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,199
You can wait to die.

103
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,839
Shen Qingtang.

104
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,120
Shen Qingtang.

105
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,399
Miss Qingtang has passed.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,560
The doctor said there's no breath left.

107
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,879
Nothing can be done.

108
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,680
The dead should be respected.

109
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,519
Eldest Young Master,
please don't disturb her.

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,199
Get out.

111
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,920
Shen Qingtang,

112
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,000
let's talk.

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,240
In a little while,

114
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,190
the people preparing
your funeral will arrive.

115
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,639
If you're still not awake by then,

116
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,839
I won't mind letting everyone know

117
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,959
what we did together.

118
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,759
I won't mind

119
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,560
showing them something
even more scandalous.

120
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,639
Pei Congzhi.

121
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,040
Done pretending?

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,879
You faked your death to leave me.

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,360
This is your choice?

124
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,680
Rather than suffer humiliation

125
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,000
and struggle to survive

126
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,560
while you press closer step by step,

127
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,660
treating me like meat
on a chopping block,

128
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,680
I'd rather risk my life to die.

129
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Your tricks might

130
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
fool outsiders.

131
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,000
You were born in Lingchuan,

132
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,720
surrounded by rivers and lakes.

133
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,160
You've been an excellent swimmer.

134
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,630
You were raised in a family of incense.

135
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,360
Concocting a drug to fake your death

136
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,519
isn't hard at all.

137
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,519
What will it take for you to let me go?

138
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,360
Remember the fear you just felt.

139
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,959
Shen Qingtang,

140
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,839
if I find out again

141
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,759
that you're trying to escape me,

142
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,160
even if you really die,

143
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,160
I still won't let you go.

144
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,519
You know very well

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,080
what I'm capable of.

146
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,639
Why did you provoke her?

147
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,690
You want to get me killed?

148
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,679
I'm so sorry.

149
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,759
I beg you.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
I shouldn't have harmed Qingtang.

151
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,799
I beg you,

152
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,799
for the sake

153
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,600
of the child I carry of the Pei family,

154
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
let me go.

155
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,360
You slapped her with the right hand.

156
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,960
Which hand held her...

157
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,000
No, don't!

158
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,440
Under the water?

159
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,840
Stop!

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,559
Grandmother.

161
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,000
Wretched child!

162
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,679
Do you want to end our family line?

163
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,639
If you insist on killing,

164
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,080
kill me instead.

165
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,159
She wants to kill Shen Qingtang.

166
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,279
One life for another.

167
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,759
That's fair.

168
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,720
Isn't she still alive?

169
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,559
If you insist
on getting justice for her,

170
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,080
I'll allow it.

171
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,759
From today on,

172
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,480
no one in this manor

173
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,879
may ever mention Tianshui Lane again.

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,960
No one will ever trouble her again.

175
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,159
Will that satisfy you?

176
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,879
Fine.

177
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,879
As you wish.

178
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,370
However,

179
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,919
the wretched maid Xinglu
harmed a family member,

180
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,600
and Pei Jingming allowed
a jealous woman to run rampant,

181
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,000
failing to detect her crimes.

182
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,200
From today on,

183
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,480
they're to be sent
to the estate to reflect.

184
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,120
Unless dead, they may never
step into the Pei Manor again.

185
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,799
You...

186
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,360
You're not someone who wishes to die.

187
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,559
Why not take the medicine?

188
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,720
