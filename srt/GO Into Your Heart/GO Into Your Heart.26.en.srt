18
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,170
- Here.
- Thanks.

19
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,900
Easy. Don't choke on it.

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,150
I won't.

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,770
Did you make these for Uncle Cheng as part of your preparation for the competition?

22
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,740
For him to have a taste and at the same time,

23
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,590
stealthily, for his opinion.

24
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,810
You're not planning to tell him that you're going to compete?

25
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,970
Of course not! If I told him now, it would cause so much trouble!

26
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,910
I will act first and report back later.

27
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,250
After I pass the audition, then I'll tell him.

28
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,120
But... Sister Cheng Yi is the host. She'll know the first thing.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,030
There are so many people in the audition.

30
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,340
How could she know?

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,810
Also, I've already told Yan Xiao

32
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,830
to place me in the safest spot.

33
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,700
Sneaky fox.

34
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,680
Senior Brother Xihe promised to practice GO with me and god knows where he ran off, too.

35
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,660
I have a sword named "Forever Love."

36
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,040
Please look.

37
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,490
The sword god is here.

38
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,380
Watching over all beings.

39
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,300
What are you doing now, Brother Xihe?

40
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,650
Unrivaled hero of the sword.

41
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,500
Out of the words "unrivaled hero of the sword,"

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,050
there really is one that suits you.

43
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,550
- Hero?
- Despicable.
(T/N: The word for despicable and sword sound the same in Chinese.)

44
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,300
I...

45
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,640
Xiao Lan, Xihe, because of you, has become obsessed.

46
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,610
Do you like him or not? Just let him know.

47
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,360
Senior Brother, this has nothing to do with me liking him or not.

48
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,340
It seems like he's only messing with me.

49
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,690
He's just trying to satisfy the drama queen side of him.

50
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,690
Think about it. Ever since I started going to college,

51
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,020
I only come here a couple of days a week.

52
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,540
Every time I see him,

53
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,740
he's never the same person.

54
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,570
Let me ask you. If you met someone like him,

55
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,990
would you want this person?

56
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,720
In your opinion, if I have my dad taste it,

57
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,920
and he tells me it's bad,

58
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,830
what do I do?

59
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,230
It won't happen. It'll definitely taste good.

60
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,170
I don't believe anything you say.

61
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,340
You think everything I cook tastes great.

62
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,780
What are you guys doing here?

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,890
Do you recognize me?

64
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,250
You're Yang Xiaoyu's father.

65
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,000
Beat him!

66
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,020
Hello? Sister-in-Law?

67
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,440
Sister-in-Law?

68
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,860
Hello, Cheng Liao.

69
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,560
Why isn't she saying anything?

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,900
Hello, Cheng Liao?

71
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,250
I'll destroy you today!

72
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,350
What's happening?

73
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,910
Senior Brother Jing, where are you two?

74
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,380
Here's their location.

75
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,950
It's not far from us.

76
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,490
Hurry up and go! Quickly!

77
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,000
Genius GO player, right?

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,280
Break his arm!

Liao Liao! Liao Liao!

80
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,080
Liao Liao.

81
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,000
- Don't touch my senior brother!
- Who are you?

82
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,760
Who cares. Beat him up!

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,410
Who dares touch my junior brother?!

84
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,220
- Let's go!
- Stop!

85
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,770
Let's go! Hurry!

86
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,730
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

87
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,290
Hurry. Hurry. Help them up.

- Jingchu!
- You sit here.

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,940
- Jingchu!
- Calm down!
- Calm down!

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,760
Calm down!

91
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,910
All right. Everyone, come with us to make your statements.

92
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,000
Wait. I'll go back with you to the station for a statement,

93
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,100
but can my girlfriend go to the hospital first?

94
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,590
Send her to the hospital.

95
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,290
Take them.

[Emergency]

97
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,250
Senior Brother.

98
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,990
How is she?

99
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,980
They're examining her.

100
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,700
Where are Senior Brother and Xihe?

101
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,860
They're taking their statements. I rushed back first.

102
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,620
Brother Jingchu, you're injured, too.

103
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,420
I'm fine.

104
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,510
- Sister Cheng Liao.
- You have soft tissue contusions. You need to rest.

105
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,750
For now, don't do any intense exercises and eat well.

106
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,220
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

107
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,890
Thank you.

108
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,650
Don't make such a sad face.

109
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,900
It's scary.

110
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,260
Okay.

111
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,310
Does your face hurt?

112
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,080
How's your hand?

113
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,560
You didn't hurt your hand, did you?

114
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,250
I'm fine.

115
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,000
- Your shoulder...
- Look.

116
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,830
It's fine.

117
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,060
It just hurts a little bit.

118
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,400
Don't worry about me.

119
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,940
How did my sister find out?

120
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,980
I asked her to come.

121
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,510
Why are you hiding? Let me see. What did you do to yourself?

122
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,500
- Does it hurt?
- I'm fine.

123
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,230
- Does the one upstairs know?
- He doesn't.

124
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,910
- Don't tell him!
- It would be bad if he did!

125
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,310
Both of you always make me worry.

126
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,940
I didn't protect her well.

127
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,950
At least you know!

128
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,680
Where is that Yang guy? Where is he?

129
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,330
He's at the police station.

130
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,880
How about this? Zhiliao,

131
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,880
take a few days off.

132
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,780
Really?

133
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,770
Brother Xu Chi, I was prepared to work with the cast on.

134
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,650
Xiao Yi, you take Zhiliao and Jingchu home to get some rest.

135
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,250
I'll take care of Uncle Cheng.

136
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,110
I'll take care of Liao Liao.

137
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,790
That's right, Sis. You stay here and keep Dad calm.

138
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,980
Why are you guys back again?

139
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,550
Shouldn't Zhiliao be bringing food and Jingchu taking the next shift?

140
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,740
She's been so busy lately.

141
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,300
She burned the wok by accident.

142
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,490
So I decided to not have her come

143
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,590
and let her go on a date with Sheng Jingchu to relax a bit.

144
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,780
- Wait! Is she okay?
- She's fine!

145
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,380
Which wok did she burn?

146
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,850
Uncle Cheng, don't worry about which wok.

147
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,920
I'll get you a whole new set.

148
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,430
Come, let's eat.

149
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,620
Does it hurt?

150
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,860
No.

151
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,970
Turn sideways when you go to sleep. Don't put pressure on it.

152
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,870
Here, take your medicine.

153
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,240
I don't want to.

154
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,890
It's bitter.

155
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,670
Are you really not taking it?

156
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,460
Really not taking it. For real really.

157
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,990
Don't be afraid.

158
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,840
Don't think about anything.

159
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,700
I'll keep you company until you fall asleep and then go.

160
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,130
I was almost scared to death.

161
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,700
Thank god you're all right.

162
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,120
Liao Liao.

163
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,470
I don't want to see you getting hurt again.

164
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,240
I don't want to see you getting hurt either.

165
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,010
Promise me,

166
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,920
never get yourself into trouble for me.

167
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,410
Impossible.

168
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,140
Be good, close your eyes.

169
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,070
I'm here with you.

170
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,880
Do you want to sneakily eat my pomelo candy?

171
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,350
You haven't had any of this candy?

172
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,240
I did!

173
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,740
Actually, when I was little, I used to love eating candy.

174
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,380
But I kept eating it and kept eating it

175
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,710
and my teeth hurt, then my sister wouldn't let me have any anymore.

176
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,080
But I'll definitely eat the ones you give me. I'll take my time eating them.

177
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,180
Take your time eating them.

178
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
Spend the rest of your life eating them.

179
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,330
♫ Like the chance encounter between the stars and the night ♫

180
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,180
♫ You can see through my thoughts ♫

181
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,430
♫ It's as if the sweet pomelo candy is about to speak ♫

182
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,300
Tofu and cucumber have been popular recently.

183
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,980
I cook it six times a week and it's better than meat.

184
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,080
♫ Are you looking forward to it, too? ♫

185

Why are you here so early?

191
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,560
I worry about you being alone here,

192
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,120
so I wanted to come over earlier to keep you company.

193
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,450
Then why don't you hurry up and help?

194
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:20,200
♫ Let me secretly guess, are you looking forward to it too? ♫

198

♫ Can you already tell?  ♫

199
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,960
Careful observation and self-taught.

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,710
♫ For you ♫

201
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,380
Come eat breakfast when you're done washing up.

202
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,270
What are we eating?

203
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,270
Milk and bread.

204
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,450
Right, Liao Liao.

205
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,160
Uncle Cheng knows that you're hurt.

206
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,170
What?!

207
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,570
What? Are you copying me?

208
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,170
I hurt my leg, so you had to hurt your arm, too. Right?

209
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,490
I'm your offspring.

210
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,730
And you're still talking back.

211
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,000
Thank god your sister told me!

212
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,780
Even if you don't tell me, I'll find out sooner or later.

213
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,320
How long can you hide it from me?

214
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,270
I broke my leg to save someone.

215
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,880
I got hurt saving someone as well.

216
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,200
That's right. He is someone.

217
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,480
I'm sorry, Uncle.

218
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,940
I didn't protect Liao Liao well.

219
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,840
So you know to blame yourself.

220
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,270
I've been blaming myself the entire time.

221
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,440
I really wish I was the one who had gotten hurt.

222
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,620
Why say that?

223
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,680
Quit acting.

224
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,820
Zhiliao, leave us for a second.

225
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,590
I don't want to leave.

226
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,500
I have things to tell Jingchu. Leave us.

227
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,210
Be nice.

228
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,910
I'm sorry, Uncle.

229
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,410
I didn't protect Cheng Liao well.

230
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,480
You've already said that.

231
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,870
No matter it's you or Liao Liao,

232
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,880
I'll take good care of both of you.

233
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,220
Can you?

234
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,450
I can.

235
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,510
I'm thirsty.

236
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,730
My neck and spine aren't feeling that well.

237
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,510
Hey, I see the floor is a bit dirty.

238
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,180
Sheng Jingchu, give me the knife.

239
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,270
This carving is very complex.

240
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,340
Zhiliao loves my exceptional carving skills.

241
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,780
Get her to eat more vitamin C.

242
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,440
Eat more fresh fruit and meat.

243
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,480
It helps with recovery. Everything else is unnecessary, got it?

244
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,000
It is indeed exceptional.

245
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
Are you feeling somewhat amazed?

246
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,290
I am amazed.

247
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,680
Xiao Zhiliao, does it still hurt?

248
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,000
It... doesn't.

249
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,300
It doesn't? Even when it's hanging like that?

250
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,520
Isn't yours hanging, too?

251
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,810
That's exactly why I know how much it hurts.

252
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,940
Xiao Jingchu, I'm not blaming you.

253
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,420
I just care about Zhiliao too much.

254
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,560
Ever since she was little, she's always taken care of others.

255
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,430
She'd rather suffer herself than see other people in pain.

256
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,810
You have to take good care of her for me.

257
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,960
Got it.

258
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,390
- Also, do you remember what I just told you?
- I remember.

259
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,490
Let's tell us who you are now.

260
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,100
- Boyfriend.
- Babysitter!

261
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,760
Zhiliao, don't do anything at home.

262
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,270
If she doesn't feel comfortable or is unhappy, I'll hold you responsible.

263
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,130
Look me in the eyes!

264
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,200
You're still not well. Don't move around.

265
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,800
My arm already doesn't hurt that much anymore.

266
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,600
Also, I need to get my shoulder used to moving around.

267
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,800
I'll do these.

268
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,700
I can do something easy at least?

269
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,900
Panda, do you know what the secret

270
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,400
to cooking a good dish is?

271
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
It's preparing the ingredients.

272
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Once you are done with the prep, you are 90% done.

273
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I've looked up the rules for the Greatness Hidden in the City competition.

274
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,400
The prep time for every main dish is about half an hour

275
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,200
to forty-five minutes.

276
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
If they give us an hour,

277
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll have to make a cold dish,

278
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,200
the main course and a soup.

279
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I always improvise when I cook at home.

280
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,000
I have to train to limit my prepping time.

281
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,400
Liao Liao,

282
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
are you still going to compete?

283
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Of course!

284
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,800
But what about your injuries?

285
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,200
I've already applied, so I have to go.

286
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,100
How's this? Once you recover,

287
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,800
I'll accompany you to other competitions.

288
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,400
In your eyes, it might just be a small internet show.

289
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,600
But after what you told me last time,

290
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,000
I've already thought it through. This might be, in my whole life,

291
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,800
or at least up to this point, the best decision I've ever made.

292
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,700
I really love cooking!

293
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,200
So entering this competiton

294
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
could be... a starting point in my life.

295
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,300
Or to put it another way, a turning point.

296
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,800
If I exaggerate,

297
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,000
this is my life's 10-game GO match.

298
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,400
No matter what the final results are,

299
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,700
even if I'm eliminated during the audition,

300
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,200
I still have to participate.

301
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,200
It was because of you that I applied this time.

302
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,000
If I quit this time,

303
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't know if I'll have the courage next time.

304
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,400
There's still time before the competition. I wasn't hurt that badly.

305
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Maybe I'll be fully recovered by then.

306
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,200
All right, boyfriend?

307
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,800
Did you push your hand too hard today?

308
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,400
It wasn't too bad. I'm still getting used to it.

309
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,800
It's just my left shoulder is still a little stiff.

310
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,600
At this pace,

311
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,000
I'll either need more time, or I can't be too detailed with the ingredients.

312
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm pretty sure that I can't pass the audition.

313
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,000
I can be your left hand.

314
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,770
Do you know how to chop vegetables?

315
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,000
I can learn from the best.

316
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,800
I think, based on how smart I am, I'll master it in no time.

317
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,100
I definitely won't drag you down.

318
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,000
So confident.

319
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,700
You can bring an assistant to the competition.

320
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,600
I know you want to do it all by yourself.

321
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,600
But you can't. I've finished the application already.

322
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,600
You're a national competitor, but you're going to be my assistant.

323
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,500
Where do you draw the line?

324
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,400
You are the line.

325
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,790
Then I think... your line is quite good-looking.

326
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Your left hand isn't bad either.

327
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,200
Sheng Jingchu, I feel you've changed.

328
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,600
Into what?

329
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,800
You talk too much now.

330
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,000
Okay. I'll shut up.

331
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,800
[Binghai City Hospital]

332
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,800
Didn't I tell you to leave the eatery?

333
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,600
What are you doing here?

334
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,200
Are you still mad?

335
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,200
I stopped being angry a while ago.

336
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,000
Then, why wouldn't you let me come over here?

337
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,260
I think you're wasting your time.

338
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,700
When I first met you, you were just like when I just graduated.

339
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,000
Focused on your dreams.

340
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,100
But when you came to the eatery, what have you been doing?

341
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Courting you.

342
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I've told you early on, that's impossible.

343
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,500
The only reason I let you stay in the eatery was for you to have a place to stay

344
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,400
and study GO.

345
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,300
Haven't you kept saying you wanted to be someone's disciple?

346
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,200
Where's your master?

347
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,070
He won't have me.

348
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,030
Have you tried to talk to him sincerely?

349
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
I...

350
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,200
Maybe I really wasn't sincere enough.

351
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,200
You're not even sincere enough to your own dream,

352
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,600
which means you're still a child.

353
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,400
You're all talk.

354
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,600
I'm quite mature.

355
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
I can prove myself to you.

356
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,000
You don't need to prove yourself to me.

357
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,800
You need to prove it to yourself.

358
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,790
Sis,

359
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,000
thank you for telling me all that.

360
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,400
You telling me all this means that you still care about me.

361
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,000
Love you.

362
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,180
You really won't take me as your disciple?

363
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,440
It's not about you. I won't teach anyone.

364
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,400
You can even use me as a test subject.

365
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,000
As long as you'll have me, I'll be responsible for the outcome.

366
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,400
There are so many good teachers out there? Why must you learn from me?

367
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,000
I've watched all of your games. No matter it's your

368
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,400
interviews, your games, or demeanor, you're unbeatable.

369
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,000
It's also you who showed me

370
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,200
what kinds of qualities a professional GO player should have.

371
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,780
No.

372
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm not sure if I can be a good teacher.

373
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,400
What if you're really good at teaching?

374
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,800
There are no what-ifs. I only do things I'm confident in.

375
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,200
The only thing I want to do is play GO.

376
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,000
When I was little and just left the country, I had no family around me

377
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,500
and no friends. No one would play with me.

378
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,800
Only when I was playing GO, I didn't feel alone.

379
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
If it wasn't for GO,

380
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,600
I would be someone hanging out on the streets with no purpose.

381
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,400
This is my truth.

382
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,400
If I don't study GO, I'll be further away from my dream.

383
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm going to say what I've been saying, other than you,

384
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,000
I won't learn from anyone else.

385
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,380
I really do love GO.

386
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,840
How long has the kid been after you?

387
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,400
It's been a while now.

388
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
Why don't you take him in?

389
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,200
I'm afraid of letting him down.

390
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Jingchu, you're just like Xiao Ke.

391
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,800
You always want to be the best.

392
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,600
Have you ever thought about it?

393
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,600
What do all those who aren't

394
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,200
the best teachers do? If no one teaches,

395
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,800
how are we going to pass GO down?

396
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,800
You're a special case.

397
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,000
I spared you from coming back to teach GO here.

398
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
But look at Chang An and the other guys.

399
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,900
They've always been teachers, helping students.

400
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,600
They never thought about whether they were the best ones.

401
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,300
As long as you make your best efforts, that's good enough.

402
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,200
Teachers teach. That's their mission.

403
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,100
As long as you are ready

404
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,500
and cautiously and conscientiously, with the heart of a craftsman,

405
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,800
lecture, teach, and help clear up confusion,

406
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,100
you will be the best teacher.

407
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Jingchu, open yourself up.

408
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,200
What are you waiting for?

409
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,300
Master, please have some tea.

410
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,200
What's with him?

411
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,100
What's with you?

412
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,600
Nothing.

413
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm just happy and excited.

414
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,600
Don't cry. Serve tea to your elder master.

415
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,850
Elder Master, please drink some tea.

416
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,690
You're making me sound so old.

417
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,210
- Senior Uncle, please drink some tea.
- All right.

418
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,960
Senior Uncle, please drink some tea.

419
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,890
Senior... Aunt...
(T/N: Aunt on the mother's side.)

420
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,130
Aunt...
(T/N: Aunt on the father's side.)

421
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,430
S-Senior...what do I call you?

422
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,160
Call me "sister"!

423
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,130
- That's not right.
- I like it!

424
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,940
I don't want those titles. We'll just call each other what we want.

425
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,530
- Senior Sister!
- Yes!

426
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,620
Please, drink some tea.

427
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,550
Thank you.

428
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,830
Hey.

429
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,310
Where's Senior Uncle Yao Ke?

430
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,290
He doesn't live here.

431
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,960
So, there's a vacancy?

432
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,210
Can I live here?

433
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,350
- This kid...
- I meant,

434
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,680
I can pay rent.

435
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,220
The environment here is so lovely.

436
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,190
Let him do what he wants. He's family now.

437
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,080
Yes.

438
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,470
I'm moving in today! I can move my stuff slowly.

439
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,120
Great! There are finally four of us.

440
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,060
Don't do anything later. Play a few rounds of Mahjong with me.

441
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,780
No problem! Fight to the end!

442
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,560
It's settled then.

443
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm going.

444
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,550
You're leaving?

445
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,120
Oh, right.

446
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,760
I have to tell you in advance.

447
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,460
Don't bother me for the next few days. Your Senior Uncle will teach you.

448
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,860
- Why?
- I have something very important to do.

449
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,290
Okay, hey! Master!

450
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,680
Goodbye, Master.

451
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,620
Disciple status achieved!

452
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,220
He's got problems. But impressive.

453
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,740
Study hard every day.

454
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,170
Uncle Cheng!

455
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,870
Sheng Jingchu, why did you buy so much stuff?

456
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,900
Who brings raw potatoes to see patients?

457
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,040
I was thinking that if I only learn to carve fruit,

458
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,960
I can't take care of Liao Liao very well.

459
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,540
I can do more.

460
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,040
Cooking?

461
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,950
Maybe it's best to start with chopping, right?

462
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,440
That's easy enough!

463
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,400
I've finished editing the plan and sent it to you.

464
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,020
Got it.

465
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:56,970
I just got some news, but I don't know if it's good or bad.

466
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,500
With Jingchu participating in our show,

467
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,530
the show is trending and there are countless positive reactions.

468
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,240
Such a huge piece of news and they're still hiding it?!

469
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,470
Good for them.

470
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,490
I just checked the registrations.

471
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,800
Zhiliao applied before the incident.

472
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,130
Her hand still hasn't recovered

473
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,680
and she has the audacity to compete.

474
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,010
Why does Sheng Jingchu let Zhiliao do whatever she wants? That's outrageous.

475
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,590
Let's see how they explain this to Cheng Fengshou.

476
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,850
- You're back.
- Yes.

477
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,070
It seems that you've really decided to compete.

478
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,060
Don't be mad. Let me explain.

479
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,450
I'm not mad.

480
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,560
I just want to know what you're really thinking.

481
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,500
Why did you want to apply?

482
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,510
I like it.

483
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,110
I remember when you just graduated from college,

484
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,700
you went to work at a coffee shop.

485
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,430
I asked you why, you also said you liked it then.

486
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,480
But that wasn't a job with a promising future.

487
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,960
You're finally an official employee at Pinecone Video

488
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,670
and the potential for promotion and development is pretty good.

489
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,650
Why not just keep doing new media?

490
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,680
You have a steady, amazing job,

491
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,570
you can still be with Sheng Jingchu

492
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,840
while he competes in other competitions. Isn't that a good thing?

493
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,180
Also, even if you are going to compete,

494
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,890
you need to think about your little injured paw.

495
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,440
Sis,

496
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,240
have you and Dad really thought about how I feel?

497
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,770
Ever since I was a kid,

498
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,450
I was working hard to

499
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,520
try and become what you two wanted me to become.

500
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,140
I remember when I wanted to apply for landscape architecture,

501
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,040
you and dad yelled at me for an entire night.

502
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,840
But I really like dealing with trees and flowers.

503
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,360
I wanted to learn how to cook back then.

504
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,190
My dad said it was a man's field.

505
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,580
Not many female cooks can endure that kind of suffering.

506
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,520
You don't like me spending my time in the kitchen either.

507
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,650
But right now... aren't you making a cooking show as well?

508
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:29,080
If you stop me now, isn't it against your intention for making the show?

509
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,020
I did...

510
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,020
I did overlook your feelings too much.

511
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,040
I keep treating you like a child.

512
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:59,440
Zhiliao, do you really like cooking?

513
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,900
I've always believed that food can cure people.

514
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,420
When I was a kid, I felt the food I made would make you and Dad happy.

515
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,980
Now, Panda is also happy when he eats my food.

516
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,150
From now on, I want other people to also taste my food.

517
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,090
I want to make more people happy.

518
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,270
Small person, but you've got big dreams.

519
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,620
It's all because you guys were too dismissive of my feelings!

520
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,100
If it wasn't for Sheng Jingchu,

521
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,350
I probably wouldn't have competed in a competition like this ever in my life.

522
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,900
I'm sorry.

523
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,620
I have to apologize to you as your sister.

524
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:00,880
I... support you in participating in the competition.

525
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:27,920
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

526
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,900
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

527
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,400
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

528
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,930
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

529
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:44,310
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

530
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:48,110
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

531
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:52,620
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

532
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,620
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

533
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:02,600
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

534
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,340
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

535
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,650
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

536
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:27,870
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

537
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:49,330
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

538
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:53,340
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

539
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,840
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

540
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,520
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

541
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,740
♫ There is color all around you ♫

542
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,590
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

543
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,740
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

544
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,120
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

545
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:32,030
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

546
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,010
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

547
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:41,950
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

548
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:47,960
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

549
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,010
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

550
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:57,860
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

551
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:04,090
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

552
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,660
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

553
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:23,090
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
