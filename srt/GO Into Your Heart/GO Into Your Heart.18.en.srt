The location of the accident

was at the intersection of Anning Road.

Do you know her well enough? What do you even like about her?

To me, she's one of a kind.

211
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,780
She lets me see the world differently.

212

So you mean... you're actually sincere about our Xiao Zhiliao?

I put my all into running this restaurant.

Honestly, I've never really taken care of them.

They were always at their grandmother's house.

Even if I tell you, you might not believe it.

Ever since they were young, I've never really taken them to the park or

I didn't buy them that many clothes either.

240
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,080
I felt like when they were with me,

241
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,480
it's because they had bad luck.

242

Especially, our Xiao Zhiliao. She didn't do well with her studies.

She also didn't have any specialties. She was too ordinary.

You just haven't seen them.

If you put it that way, then I'm a terrible father.

I paid them too little attention.

But I didn't wear this jacket enough.

You can't just suddenly take away my favorite jacket.

At that time, a little girl came over...

and gave me a piece of pomelo candy that would get rid of any pain.

342

How's your break going?

343
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:51,080
- Get ready to come to Shanghai with me.
 - Shanghai?

344
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,880
My classmate is the director of a video streaming platform in Shanghai. They invited me to be a host.

345
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,740
But I probably need to start with small programs.

346
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,180
That's not a problem, Sister Yi. With your ability,

347
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,650
even small programs can become hits.

348
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,050
All right, stop flattering me.

349
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,490
Hurry and come pack.

350
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:13,090
- And... I'll think about how to tell my family.
 - Okay, Sister.

351
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,690
All right, talk to you later. Bye-bye.

352
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,390
Bye-bye.

353
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,060
- What kind of new tricks are you working on now?
- Older Sister!

354
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
- You're here!
- Where's my dad?

355
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,210
He's in a great mood today.

356
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,600
So he went fishing with a few friends. He'll be back later.

357
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,220
All right.

358
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,230
Sis, you seem happy today.

359
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,990
Is there good news from the job hunt?

360
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,770
It's true, I got a new job.

361
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,450
But I need to go to Shanghai.

362
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,860
Shang… Shanghai.

363
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,580
Shanghai's pretty good, as long as you're happy.

364
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,770
It’s quite good.

365
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:11,070
But when I think of leaving here, my dad and the two of them,

366
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,250
it makes me a bit sad.

367
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,050
- Do you want me to go with you?
- Not necessary.

368
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,100
At least there would be someone there to speak to and drink with.

369
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,910
Wouldn't that be great?

370
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,980
You have to stay here. Your dream is here. You need to learn GO.

371
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,830
I can take a class in the morning and fly to Shanghai in the evening and keep you company.

372
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,470
- So wasteful.
- It’s just two plane tickets.

373
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,460
Just two plane tickets? It’s every day!

374
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,020
That's so much money. It’s like a kid making irresponsible promises.

375
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,020
I take responsibility for what I say. It really is nothing.

376
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,770
You just don't understand me well enough.

377
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,320
Fine. Thanks for your kind words.

378
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,220
I've got to go. Please clean up this table for me.

379
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,440
You just sat down and now you're leaving? Wait, Sis!

380
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,590
When are you leaving? I’ll go with you.

381
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,070
I'm not telling you.

382
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,800
- Sis!
- Not listening!

383
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,340
- I love you!  (T/N: in Japanese)
- Shut Up!

384
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,870
What's wrong with you two?

385
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,470
I'm just going to work in Shanghai, it's not like I'm not coming back.

386
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,890
Every year, you’ll only come home for a few days.

387
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,460
Who said that? If you miss me, I’ll fly back right away.

388
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,770
You’ll fly back right away? Don’t make unrealistic promises.

389
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,560
So what, it’s just a plane ticket.

390
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,310
The most important thing is to make our dad happy.

391
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,150
All right.

392
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,580
You're both grown now.

393
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,970
Zhiliao suddenly brought home the GO God.

394
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,670
And you’re really something as well.

395
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:51,450
From your resignation, to your job hunt, to moving to Shanghai, did you tell me anything?

396
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,460
You only tell me when you’re about to leave in two days.

397
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,500
At least give me some time to process.

398
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,510
I didn’t tell you earlier because I didn’t want you to be worried.

399
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,640
Zhiliao.

400
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,710
When you have decided to move into Sheng Jingchu’s place, please tell me ahead of time.

401
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,290
Dad, what are you talking about? Our relationship isn't there yet.

402
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,530
It’s hard to say. I can tell.

403
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,860
When love comes too fast, it's as unpredictable as a tornado.

404
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,990
You two little cotton jackets,

405
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,130
I've decided I shouldn't be wearing. I should stick with my vest.

406
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,200
Where are you going? You haven’t touched your dinner yet.

407
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,800
It’s all right. I’m not hungry. I’m going to prepare noodles for you two.

408
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Why are you making noodles right now?

409
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,030
Dumplings on top and noodles at the bottom,

410
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,570
I made dumplings and they're in the refrigerator.

411
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,720
Sis!

412
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,810
Dad, what’s the matter?

413
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,990
You're making it so I don’t want to leave now.

414
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,220
It's fine.

415
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,870
You should go. You can’t be by my side for the rest of your life.

416
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,460
I'll eventually get used to it.

417
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,440
Are we making a chain?

418
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,200
Have we become a train?

419
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,940
- You brat!
- How dare you bully my sister!

420
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,100
- Cheng Fengshou!
- No… No… No!

421
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,550
Put it down!

422
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,520
Hello, who are you looking for?

423
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,280
I’m looking for Cheng Yi.

424
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,450
She is no longer with our station. She resigned a few days ago.

425

[Old Xu]

426
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,610
Hello?

427
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,390
I wanted to surprise you.

428
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,480
I never thought you'd be the one to surprise me first.

429
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,940
When did you resign?

430
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,910
Not long ago.

431
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,420
Why didn’t you tell me?

432
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,780
I was planning on telling you when I got to Shanghai.

433
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,410
Chen Yi, why are you leaving?

434
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,920
I’ve already planned out everything for you at Pinecone Video.

435
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,840
You can just show up at work, isn't that a good thing?

436
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,590
Where are you? I'll come and find you.

437
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,680
Old Xu, I'm out. Don’t come and look for me.

438
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,250
How about this? You get back to work. Why don’t we talk about this later?

439
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,890
I'm hanging up now.

440
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,700
VP Xu, there's a document we need your approval on.

441
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,960
[To myself two years from now]

442
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,720
[Xu Chi, Cheng Yi is there. If she doesn't come, go to her. Give yourself 2 years. Don't be disillusioned. Don't give up or stop trying. When you read this, I hope you won't be the only one who's smiling and that Cheng Yi will be by your side.]

443
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,850
Director Wang, are you in the office? I want to see you.

444
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,830
This proposal isn't bad.

445
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,040
But my guess is this is a television station project, right?

446
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,090
It’s not an easy task to tackle.

447
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,940
This is what I'm proposing.

448
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,520
Pinecone Video will be the exclusive sponsor for the Reaching Success series.

449
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,380
We'll own the internet rights and the naming rights. I'm sure the station would agree to our proposal.

450
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,420
At the end of the day, they wouldn't need to spend a dime for a brand new show.

451
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,410
And for us, we’ve got the internet copyright and added interaction with the TV station.

452
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,290
I think it is a win-win situation.

453
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,570
Direction Wang, please trust in me wholeheartedly.

454
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,780
I would use my career and my position to guarantee this.

455
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:42,010
I believe this project will be successful. If anything goes wrong throughout the shooting,

456
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,190
I‘ll resign.

457
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,340
Thanks.

458
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,900
Thank you.

459
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,740
I presented your proposal to Director Wang already, he's really interested,

460
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,200
plus he's also decided to invest in this project.

461
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,780
Behind the proposal is a contract with you.

462
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,850
Go home and think about it. If you still insist on leaving, I won’t stop you.

463
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,910
If you decide to stay,

464
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,900
then I hope you can put your signature on the contract.

00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:31,580
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

474
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,370
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

475
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:39,950
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

476
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,020
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

477
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,860
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

478
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:55,790
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the
Cocoon and flying far because of your talent ♫

479
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,980
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

480
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:14,060
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

481
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:36,440
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

482
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,360
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

483
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:45,110
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

484
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:48,890
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

485
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,940
♫ There is color all around you ♫

486
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,860
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

487
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,130
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

488
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:09,480
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

489
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,980
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

490
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:23,360
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

491
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,260
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

492
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:35,210
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

493
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,360
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

494
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,150
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

495
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:51,260
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

496
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,200
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

497
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:09,960
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
