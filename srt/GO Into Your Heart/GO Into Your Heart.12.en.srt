[Episode 12]

18
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,680
The color of the sunset is so pretty today.

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,390
Quick, come look.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,170
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,710
I forgot.

22
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,890
It's okay. You can tell me about it.

23
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,840
I can imagine it.

24
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,050
Today's orange sunset isn't often seen.

25
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,790
The color of the burning clouds

26
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,040
are like the color of fresh oranges.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,760
Shines like gold, one layer after another.

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,810
A lot like the orange soda cake that the cafe I worked in used to make.

29
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,340
After your competition, I'll take you to try it. You'll see what I mean after you taste it.

30
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,420
Is your cake-phobia

31
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,230
okay now?

32
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,780
You said it. Memories can be refreshed.

33
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,220
However, one can't take delicious food for granted.

34
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,380
Okay. We'll have cake after the competition.

35
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,020
Thank you, Teacher, for today. You've worked hard.

36
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,540
But to be honest,

37
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,410
I thought a great GO player like you

38
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,240
wouldn't want to teach us amateurs.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,150
Maybe it's because that I like being the teacher.

40
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,210
- Who are you?
- Please don't misunderstand me.

41
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,180
I'm not a thief.

42
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,670
Nor am I a robber.

43
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,560
I'll pay you back for this later.

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,040
You must be Sheng Jingchu, right?

45
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,880
I've called you many times, but you never pick up.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,330
I came to find you, but the security wouldn't let me in.

47
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,380
I was out of ideas, so I had to make a bad decision and climbed over the walls to get here.

48
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,330
What do you want?

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,910
I want you to be my master.

50
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,660
Don't move!

51
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,070
It's you!

52
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,980
- Do you know him?
- No, I don't.

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,930
He was the one who made my sister become the headline news last time.

54
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,720
Cheng Yi is your sister?

55
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,410
You were the one who challenged Jiuzhou Hall, but got defeated by Lan Lan.

56
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,210
Both of you know me!

57
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,320
- That's amazing!
- Don't move!

58
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,060
I'm sure you both know,

59
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,820
how badly I want you to take me as a disciple. Right?

60
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,600
I just want you to be my teacher.

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,610
I don't like teaching.

62
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,700
But I want to be the greatest GO player.

63
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,440
They told me that you're the only person who can teach the best GO skills.

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,590
Don't move. Leave immediately.

65
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,920
I won't.

66
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,620
If you won't take me as your disciple today,

67
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,630
I'll stay here. I won't go anywhere.

68
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,160
Wait a minute, Master! Master!

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,880
Master, please, just let me be your disciple!

70
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,240
I... I... I...

71
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,310
He's got problems.

72
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,710
So turns out the GO God lies sometimes, too.

73
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,130
I didn't lie.

74
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,640
Then how come one minute you like being a teacher

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,210
- and then later you don't.
- It depends on the person.

76
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,310
When you put it that way, I feel oddly honored somehow.

77
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,300
Okay.

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,880
- I have to go.
- I will walk you out.

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,000
No need. I've taken up your entire afternoon already.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,100
Just prepare for the competition.

81
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,790
Once you win the competition, we'll go eat cake.

82
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,140
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

83
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,830
Goodbye, Teacher.

84
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,760
Today, with Jiuzhou Hall as its center, the Sihai Jiuzhou Cup Four Countries Invitational GO Tournament

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,620
has officially begun.

86
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,930
The first to arrive at the press conference is the rising star of Singapore, Ye Chen, 7th dan.

87
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,860
Following him is the Japanese player known for his personality, Katou Kiyomasa, 9th dan.

88
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,480
Next, due to his handsome look and GO skills, Jo Yeon Hoon, 9th dan,

89
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,430
is popular among Korean fans.

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,310
In this competition, the ones people are looking the most forward to

91
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,700
are still the GO players of the Jiuzhou Hall.

92
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,680
They include, the only female GO, player, Ding Lan, 4th dan, and

93
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,160
the GO player best known for his exceptional talent and multiple championships winner,

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,560
also known as Shengshi Tianyuan. (T/N: a prosperous era)

95
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,150
Who also becomes the center of attention wherever he goes, Sheng Jingchu, 9th dan.

96
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,530
Next, the player who is known for using Mahjong logic while playing GO, Cao Xihe, 8th dan.

97
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,840
After that, Sheng Jingchu's old opponent for years,

98
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,950
and now a Jiuzhou Hall player, Yao Ke, 9th dan.

99
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,160
And also, the son of Xie Hanzhou, the senior brother of Jiuzhou Hall,

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,260
Xie Changan, 3rd dan.

101
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,930
As one of the best GO halls in the country

102
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,310
in past few years GO competitions,

103
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,930
they achieved many titles under Sheng Jingchu's leadership.

104
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,760
We believe this time, they'll also live up to their expectations

105
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,240
and fight amazing battles

106
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,710
with the other young international GO players.

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,690
Welcome everyone to Binhai, to participate in the Sihai Jiuzhou Cup

108
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,270
Four Countries Invitational GO Tournament.

109
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,590
For this tournament, we have the pleasure to invite

110
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,020
the GO God, Master Nie Weiting to watch the events.

111
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,110
Next, please welcome Master Nie and the players to the stage.

112
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,650
Hello, Master Nie. Happy to meet you. I'm the onsite reporter.

113
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,190
The Sihai Jiuzhou Cup Four Countries Invitational GO Tournament

114
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,670
is the only commercial competition that's organized by a GO hall.

115
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,210
We also really hope for more competitions like this. What's your opinion on this?

116
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,540
I've said more than once before,

117
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,980
as long as it's good for the development of GO,

118
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,310
I'm happy to support, contribute,

119
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,340
and to help promote it. Such as this invitational tournament,

120
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,490
the fact that we are able to have China's Jiuzhou Hall as the center

121
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,220
and to invite all young, top GO players in other countries,

122
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,740
is not only a validation of our abilities,

123
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,460
but also a good chance for the young Jiuzhou players to practice.

124
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,550
After all, the future of GO will depend on the young players.

125
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,160
I hope we can have more competitions like this.

126
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,280
Hello, Master Nie. I'm a reporter from Youku.

127
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,200
Can I ask what you predict the competition results might be?

128
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,980
Because everyone is young, they'll learn from each other and grow together,

129
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,800
it's more meaningful to win and lose.

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,390
However, personally,

131
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,780
I hope our Jiuzhou players

132
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,130
can endure the pressure and do well.

133
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,680
After all, we have

134
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,020
the most popular player of the GO world, Sheng Jingchu, here in the competition.

135
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,130
I hope he can get a good ranking

136
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,030
and not let his fans down.

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,450
Okay, that's it from me. Let's hear from the young people!

138
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,240
Here's our one and only female player.

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,990
- Please do your best.
- I will, Master Nie.

140
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,140
Hello, may I have an exclusive?

141
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,000
Master Nie.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,150
Master Nie, please.

143
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,130
Master Nie.

144
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,140
May I ask Sheng Jingchu and Cao Xihe,

145
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,180
what's your opinion on the Japanese player, Katou Kiyomasa, who's been advancing by leaps and bounds?

146
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,830
He sees you two as the players he wants to

147
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,190
challenge the most.

148
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,570
He's really outstanding. He's great.

149
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,130
However, the player I want to challenge the most is Jo Yeon Hoon.
(T/N: In Chinese known as Zhao Yanxun.)

150
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,350
He would like to play against you the most. (In Korean)

151
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,410
Well, that would be nice.

152
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,230
But I am not expecting this match as much as you are,

153
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,020
because you've never defeated me.

154
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,210
So, to me, I think

155
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,430
it's not that challenging.

156
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,230
That's all.

157
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,480
Sure, just you wait.

your heart will also calm down.

All right.

326
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,030
I'll play a game with you.

327
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,460
Why hasn't Sheng Jingchu come out? The game has started for 10 minutes already.

328
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,020
Everyone, just stay calm and wait a little bit.

329

No, no. Everyone, listen to me.

330

Jingchu has no illness at all.

331
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,050
He'll come out in a little while, okay?

Let's stay calm and wait a little bit.

No, no, no flash! No flash!

334

Just wait a little. He'll come out soon. There's no problem.

[Katou Kiyomasa, 9th dan]

351
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,130
Everyone knows that Katou Kiyomasa

352
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,810
is a Japanese player with a unique personality.

353
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,780
He used to emphasize balance when he played GO.

354
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,450
His GO formation is always presenting aesthetics.

355
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,770
You're welcome to run away

356
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,700
is a common phrase that he tells his opponents.

357
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,600
"Subdue the enemy without fighting" is the best description for Katou Kiyomasa.

358
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,570
With his style, if he runs into a kind of

359
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,790
fierce and aggressive type of attacking player,

360
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,110
his ability to win would probably be unstable.

361
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,520
But when we observe how Katou Kiyomasa has played GO in the past year,

362
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,320
we can see that his playing style has become more pragmatic than before.

363
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,720
Japanese GO fans used to call Katou Kiyomasa,

364
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,490
Romantic Katou.

365
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,260
Now, "Fight Hard Katou" is the name that's become louder and louder.

366
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,070
9th-dan Katou's condition is excellent right now. It really won't be easy to defeat him,

367
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,730
especially when Jingchu today...

368
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,490
had a small issue.

369
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,380
We believe it's going to be a good game to watch today.

370
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:16,850
That's right.

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,710
Sheng Jingchu’s started in poor condition, it's taking forever to make a move.

Cao Xihe was moving so swiftly, but it wasn't working early on.

Right now he keeps watching Jo Yeon Hoon's face.

377

I'm afraid the Jiuzhou brothers might be defeated today.

378
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,930
Why didn't Jingchu take this piece?

379
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,930
If he carries on like this, it’ll collapse.

380
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,480
Look at this game structure, it shows Kato’s strength.

381
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,790
If Jingchu’s white stones want to win, it'll be very difficult.

Senior Brother is facing such an obstacle.

383

Jingchu is setting up the Qi Jin,  (T/N: Key Stone)

391
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,200
he must have predicted that Katou made a misstep.

392
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,080
Otherwise, he wouldn’t allow the black stone to be taken.

That's so fierce.

395
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:47,370
His technique just now was to escape the foreshadowing of the strategic move in the middle of the game.

396
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,890
Teacher Katou must be especially regretful now that he was fooled.

With that slight carelessness, the opportunity was taken.
