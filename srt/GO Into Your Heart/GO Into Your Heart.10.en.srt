00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,940
- That day—
- That day? What "that day"?

161
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,830
Don't be endlessly annoying.

162
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,760
Sister,

163
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,200
I know that. You're mistaken.

164
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,260
Actually, I'm here to return the money.

165
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,440
But I don't have money to pay you back now, so I can only write an IOU for you.

166
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,050
Forget it. You don't need to pay it back.

167
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,590
[I owe you ¥5,000.]

168
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,270
You wrote an extra zero, right?

169
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,720
I only gave you ¥500 that day.

170
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,440
I know that I wrote an extra zero.

171
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,290
No, wait... What do you mean by that?

172
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,270
These days, I've kept working.

173
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,150
I've been performing on the streets, passing out flyers, delivering food orders,

174
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,080
doing all the work that can be done.

175
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,750
But I still can't make much money.

176
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,660
I can only eat one meal each day.

177
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,230
I can only sleep in the cheapest place.

178
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,340
But there still isn't enough money.

179
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,800
The ¥500 you gave me that day, after paying for the room,

180
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,520
I spent it really quickly.

181
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,390
So...

182
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,670
the meaning for this IOU is...

183
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,760
can you loan me another ¥4,500 to add up to ¥5,000 total?

184
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,890
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- It hurts. It hurts. Sis, it hurts!

185
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,320
Sister, let go. It hurts!

186
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,630
Don't make trouble anymore, or I won't be polite anymore.

187
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,020
What exactly do you want to do?

188
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,180
I just want to learn GO.

189
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,730
Why is it so hard?

190
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,550
I don't want to just go back like this.

191
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,230
I don't want my dream to be shattered just like this.

192
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,280
That's all, Sister.

193
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,620
I was really so tired and sleepy. That's why I fell asleep.

194
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,930
- Are you full?
- No.

195
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,290
Boss, add an extra order here.

196
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,070
Thank you, Sister.

197
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,990
Is it worth it... to fight so hard?

198
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,950
I don't know if it's worth it.

199
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,610
But there is one thing, it's just that when I play GO,

200
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,930
it's the time when I feel the most relaxed and happy.

201
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,900
You remind me of when I just graduated

202
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,950
and went to work as an intern at the TV station.

203
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,390
No salary, not one of the official team, nothing at all.

204
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,340
At that time, I almost didn't see any hope for the future.

205
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,070
But I was the same as you are now,

206
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,880
as long as I was focused on a road, I'd persist in walking it.

207
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,670
At that time, I rushed to do all the work in the TV station.

208
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,370
Such as editing the video, writing the script, carrying the equipment,

209
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,890
including working as an assistant to the TV anchor at the time.

210
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,750
But precisely because of this process that accumulated experience,

211
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,020
I was able to possess all the skills that a TV anchor should have.

212
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,380
Later, I finally got a chance to be on the screen.

213
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,660
I used all those years of accumulated experience and conquered the audience,

214
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,800
employees, and the boss.

215
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,070
That's when I officially became

216
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,180
a qualified TV host.

217
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,000
So inspirational.

218
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,180
No wonder you're my goddess sister.

219
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,980
I'm also feeling reflective about your current condition of loneliness and stubbornness.

220
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,490
That's why I've said all this to you.

221
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,270
I hope it can encourage you.

222
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,070
Don't be afraid.

223
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,230
Sometimes, it's when people are in a tight spot

224
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,960
that there can be more possibilities for the future.

225
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,520
Ever since I came back to the country, what you just said

226
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,090
are the warmest words I've heard.

227
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,790
Thank you.

228
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,730
Thanks.

229
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,430
Eat.

230
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,400
Take your time eating. I've got things to do so I'll be leaving now.

231
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,000
Where are you going? I'll take you.

232
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,050
No need. You go ahead and eat. I've already paid the check.

233
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,920
Mr. Sheng, I've noticed that after you've fallen in love,

234
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,830
you're finally starting to live a real life.

235
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,650
For instance, about your cooking.

236
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,310
It's really healthy and amazing.

237
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,560
But there's one thing that I can't figure out.

238
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,300
You say that you can't see colors.

239
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,110
How can you tell if the food is cooked or not?

240
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,710
I naturally have my own solutions.

241
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,940
But, Mr. Sheng, if you eat something that's not cooked through, you could get food poisoning.

242
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,530
This isn't a game. It's better that I cook.

243
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,890
No need. You can leave after you're done.

244
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,150
Okay. After I've tidied up these bags, I'll leave.

245
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,930
Don't touch!

246
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,160
Mr. Sheng, you're about to compete. You should hurry and practice GO.

247
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,070
Let me handle these miscellaneous things.

248
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,690
Don't touch!

249
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,750
I can do it myself.

250
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,910
Why are you so courteous with me? Really.

251
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,520
Mr. Sheng! Mr. Sheng!

252
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,150
Mr. Sheng!

253
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,000
Why exactly did I do wrong?

254
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,050
What is it? Are the flowers growing bugs?

255
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,080
I don't understand it either, but they're not growing well lately.

256
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,760
So I thought about asking you to take a look.

257
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,980
I'll take a look then.

258
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,530
These flowers are actually doing really well.

259
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,760
You just need to water them often.

260
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,330
Look. These baby plants may look weak,

261
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,460
but actually, their vitality is particularly strong.

262
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,880
Don't forget, they climbed up bit by bit through the soil.

263
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,930
So, don't worry.

264
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:38,090
Actually, I'm worried about you.

265
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,540
My mood today really wasn't that great.

266
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,290
What's wrong?

267
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,850
The director doesn't think my new program is any good.

268
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,810
But I don't see anything wrong with it.

269
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,000
I've made preparations already.

270
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,260
Don't you like to cook and eat whenever you feel down?

271
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,650
You can do as you wish.

272
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,590
I... have another request.

273
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,930
Say it.

274
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,970
If I mess up this place,

275
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,710
you won't complain. Okay? I'll definitely clean it up afterward.

276
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,640
But I really do feel a little annoyed right now.

277
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,500
I've already said it. You can do as you wish.

278
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,510
Then, can you leave for the moment?

279
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,250
Here.

280
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,480
Do you feel happier now?

281
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,610
All the worries vanished into thin air.

282
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,980
It's just that... I've messed up your kitchen a bit.

283
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,770
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,230
It's fine. It's been unused for a while anyway.

285
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,010
It'll also feel happy when there's an occasional bustle in it.

286
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,530
I'll return it back to good shape later. Let's eat.

287
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,760
Sorry, sorry.

288
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,130
Sorry.

289
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,770
I must have clicked open something.

290
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,600
It's nothing. You opened the garage door.

291
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,760
The garage?

292
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,650
You don't drive, but you have a garage?

293
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,660
I have a car.

294
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,980
Why would you buy a car?

295
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,710
I can't see colors so I can't drive.

296
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,190
This was a prize from a competition.

297
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,610
This car is so pretty!

298
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,260
Good color, too.

299
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,020
This brand looks familiar.

300
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,070
A small horse,

301
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,970
with the two front legs pushing up.

302
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,770
What's the brand?

303
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,740
Ferrari.

304
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,990
I knew it!

305
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,060
Even though I don't really understand cars,

306
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,000
but I know about Ferrari's.

307
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Give it a try.

308
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,400
I don't know how to drive.

309
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm not asking you to drive it. Testing it out isn't illegal.

310
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
Press that button.

311
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,600
This one?

312
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,600
How do you know this if you don't drive?

313
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,000
I know all the details about driving.

314
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,900
I just lack a set of eyes that can differentiate color.

315
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,000
If one day

316
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I can see color, I'll definitely get a driver's license.

317
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Then when you get a license, take me on a drive.

318
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
It's a deal.

319
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,900
Pinky promise.

320
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,430
This car is too cool.

321
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,970
You like it?

322
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,300
I'll give it to you.

323
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Did I save the galaxy in my past life?

324
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,400
No, I can't accept the car.

325
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
I can't drive it anyway.

326
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,800
Don't take a reward, if it's not deserved.

327
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,000
You cooked for me.

328
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Cooking is enough? Wouldn't I have to cook for you for the rest of your life then?

329
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Why did the car turn off?

330
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
It didn't break, did it?

331
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,600
Looks like you really will need to cook for me for the rest of my life.

332
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,000
I didn't press anything. Why did it turn off?

333
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,700
It's out of gas.

334
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,000
Thank you, Senior Brother.

335
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,400
The pressure is great today.

336
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,100
A little lighter. Lighter.

337
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,200
A little bit lighter.

338
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,600
Why is it you? Why are you here?!

339
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,000
Master, I didn't get that spot yet.

340
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
Let go!

341
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
What are you doing here?

342
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,700
I... I came to pay respects to my master.

343
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,800
Stop playing around. Who's your master?

344
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,700
He's pretty handsome.

345
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,200
Should I be generous and accept him?

346
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,800
No!

347
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,400
I've been 8th dan for so many years and I've never accepted an apprentice.

348
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,400
You're 4th dan, on what basis are you accepting an apprentice?

349
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,900
He volunteered. I don't care.

350
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,100
Okay.

351
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,400
Master, accept my bow.

352
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,600
Get up! Follow me outside!

353
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,500
- Master!
- Hey, that's my apprentice!

354
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,800
I–

355
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,200
Let's lay everything out right here.

356
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,800
What we can't figure out with words, I can also accept other methods.

357
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,500
Are you challenging me

358
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,800
to an embarrassing dance?

359
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
Don't play dumb.

360
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,600
There are a lot of people trying to pursue her. Get in line.

361
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,400
Oh, that many?

362
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,200
Because she's so outstanding, no one is good enough.

363
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,700
I don't want to pursue her.

364
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,000
I want to pursue... you.

365
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,300
Brother, does your hand hurt?

366
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,400
Shut up!

367
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,900
I'm warning you, don't play with me.

368
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,400
I heard everything you guys said earlier.

369
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
She's 4th dan

370
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,260
and you...

371
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,030
are 8th dan.

372
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,500
Let go!

373
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,800
- So what?
- You must be better than her.

374
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,100
How about you be my master?

375
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,400
So... you aren't trying to pursue her?

376
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,800
How could that be possible?

377
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,900
I know you like her.

378
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
- Is it that obvious?
- Of course.

379
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
I'm not that oblivious. So please don't misunderstand.

380
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,500
I just want to find the best teacher and become the best GO player.

381
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Then it's no use for you to ask me.

382
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
If you want to be the best,

383
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
then you need to start with the king.

384
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,830
Brother.

385
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,400
Then who's the king?

386
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,800
A prosperous era, Sheng Jingchu.

387
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Sheng Jingchu?

388
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,900
You have a new order, please handle it immediately.

389
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
Any more?

390
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,400
It must be delivered before noon.

391
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Brother. What a coincidence!

392
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,400
Takeout. Express delivery. You deliver them all?

393
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,100
Who doesn't want to earn more money, right?

394
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,300
Come in and talk.

395
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,600
Is it convenient?

396
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,700
Let's go.

397
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,500
Help me watch this. Thank you.

398
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,400
Take a seat over there.

399
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,700
How have you been? Tired?

400
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,600
It's been all right. I'm a little tired,

401
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,500
but I'm happy.

402
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,200
Sounds like

403
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,800
you've made progress with your goddess sister?

404
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,000
She gave me her number. I can take initiative and contact her.

405
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
You're pretty good.

406
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,000
Brother, how are you? Any progress?

407
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,100
Not yet, but I'm not in a rush.

408
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,800
I've known her for a long time and understand her really well.

409
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,800
I believe that if I have enough patience and dedication,

410
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,700
one day she'll be touched.

411
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,800
I don't think so.

412
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,600
If you really like her, you have to take the initiative.

413
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,150
Be straightforward. You definitely can't take it slow.

414
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,800
Be careful of someone snatching her away.

415
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
You're giving me advice?

416
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,500
No wait. I didn't mean that.

417
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,400
I'm just sharing my experience.

418
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,000
- You should focus on getting your goddess sister first.
- Okay.

419
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,400
I hope you can succeed soon, too.

420
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
That's all for now.

421
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,000
It's getting late. I also asked her out to eat.

422
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,630
You're so lucky. You can even ask her out to eat.

423
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,380
I also asked my goddess sister but she's busy.

424
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm off to do deliveries.

425
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,200
Didn't you save your goddess' number?

426
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Why?

427
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,200
Are you stupid? Add her on WeChat.

428
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Oh right.

429
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,000
Add her on WeChat. Why didn't I think of that?

430
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,400
Brother, you're truly my compass.

431
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,110
Thanks. I'll treat you out to a meal sometime.

432
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,500
Forget it.

433
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll treat you instead.

434
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,250
E-Even though I'm poor,

435
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,900
I can still treat you to a bowl of noodles, right?

436
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I thought you wouldn't want to see me.

437
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,400
Why?

438
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,600
As long as you're not confused anymore, then we're still best friends.

439
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
- I wasn't confused.
- Old Xu,

440
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,800
don't say anything else. If you do, I'll really leave.

All right, I'll stop.

For me? What is it?

444

There are only a few more episodes of Cheng Yi Conversations left.

You don't need to be so polite with me.

448
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,400
You helped me so much before with the All-Around Challenge. And it all went to waste.

449
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
You're still mentioning that?

00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,430
youth Go classes in the afternoon, and there is a lot to do at the shop.

484
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,980
- Then what about you, Sister?
- Working overtime.

485
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,760
Dad, I'm going to work. Hurry and eat. Stop dilly-dallying and don't always be late.

486
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,530
Eat.

487
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,570
I need to go buy meat.

488
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,020
Wash the dishes after you eat.

489
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,910
None of them remember my birthday.

490
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,750
Neither of them remembers.

491
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,060
What's going on with this?

492
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:40,730
Senior Brother Jing, I've only been gone a few days. Why did you build a greenhouse?

493
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,350
I wanted to add some color to life.

494
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,840
Stop kidding. Can you see color?

495
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,550
- Using my mind to see.
- Yeah, right.

496
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,590
Senior Brother Jing,

497
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,760
I bought you some fruit.

498
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,160
Look! The weather is so nice today.

499
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,240
Let me take your Ferrari out for a ride.

500
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,580
- I knew it.
- You always ask me a few times each year.

501
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,070
Don't you get tired of it?

502
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,520
I'll give it to you.

503
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,480
Did I save the galaxy in my past life?

504
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,450
No, I can't accept your car.

505
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,840
I can't drive it anyway.

506
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,650
Don't take a reward, if it's not deserved.

507
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:44,710
Xi He, if you suddenly give someone a really valuable gift,

508
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,140
is it rude?

509
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,910
Too rude.

510
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,380
You want to give someone a gift?

511
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,180
Don't you never let go of anything in your possession?

512
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,090
Depends on the person.

513
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,460
That's hurtful. I'm your best buddy, right?

514
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,870
Even I can't, then...

515
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,400
Sister-in-Law, right?

516
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,130
Then I have no reason to be jealous.

517
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,630
But Senior Brother Jing, I have to say,

518
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,390
you have a unique eye for people.

519
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,150
Ever since Sister-in-Law's program was broadcasted,

520
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,090
my Weibo followers have increased exponentially.

521
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,000
Then you should thank her.

522
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,220
Of course I need to.

523
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,910
- But how should I thank her?
- I have an idea.

524
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,390
- Hello?
 - Hello, Sister Cheng Liao?

525
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,500
We're going to karaoke tomorrow. Cao Xihe is paying.

526
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,230
He entrusted me with the task of making sure you're invited.

527
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,680
So you have to come.

528
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,620
I have plans tomorrow.

529
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,570
I should have plans,

530
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,230
but they aren't confirmed yet.

531
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,690
Plus, you all are going as a group to sing,

532
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,710
- I won't crash the party then, okay?
 - What do you mean?

533
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,710
Tomorrow you're the most, most, most, important guest.

534
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,800
You have to come.

535
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,940
[Happy Birthday]

536
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,500
Stop hesitating. Just come.

537
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,880
- Okay, I'll go.
- Really?

538
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,950
Then it's a done deal. I'll send you the address later.

539
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,260
Okay, bye-bye.

[Love gossip: the two faces of a sister of Binhai stations. Binhai Station's Cheng Yi and her male friend were getting drunk...]

542
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,060
You need to pay more attention to these areas.

543
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,680
[The Two Faces of Bin Tai TV's Top Host: In the picture, a male friend hugs Cheng Yi lovingly. A picture of the male friend's face is also revealed.]

544
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,510
Look at your phone.

545
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,930
Sister Cheng Yi?

546
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,830
It really is her.

547
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,190
They're having dinner together.

548
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,430
- Dinner? They're clearly on a date.
- Hurry, look at your phone.

549

[Dancing in the night club. Fresh young thing. Body on body. Truly eye-opening.]

550
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,080
- It really is her.
- Who's the guy?

551
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,300
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.

552
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,730
He's pretty handsome.

553
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,980
Pretty good, Sister Cheng Yi.

554
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,290
I hope you can win her heart soon.

555
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,420
I hope you can win the heart of your goddess.

556
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,250
- I never heard about this.
- Right.

557
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,660
For the picture to be released so suddenly.

558
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,600
The number you called is currently unavailable.

559
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,300
I just got the funding, staff, and

560
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,810
equipment together, for Matchless GO Players, including the broadcasting van.

561
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,820
Got them for you one by one.

562
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,850
Why did you have to make a mistake at this moment?!

563
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,940
Cheng Yi, you really don't know how to act appropriately.

564
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,120
All the comments on the Binhai TV Stations Weibo are negative.

565
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,910
I could only turn off the comments. The stations called just now,

566
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,110
you're no longer reporting on the Sihai Jiuzhou Cup Four Countries Invitational GO Tournament.

567
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,280
All of your talk shows are also canceled.

568
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,520
I'm sorry.

569
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,810
I didn't think it would cause so much trouble for the station.

570
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,850
In response,

571
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,480
I'll apologize to everyone.

572
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,710
You should do some self-reflection.

573
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,980
But I'd like to ask you,

574
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,010
just with this piece of news and this picture,

575
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,390
what did I do wrong?

576
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,360
You're the most important host at the company.

577
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,480
You need to be mindful of your image.

578
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,150
I'm single, have never married,

579
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,340
I'm not having an affair or cheating on anyone.

580
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,830
I'm way over 21 years old and can legally drink. What did I do wrong?

581
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,180
You're a public figure.

582
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,960
Public figures are also people.

583
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,730
Then you should still think about your influence. It's inappropriate to hug a man like that.

584
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,210
Did you see the picture?

585
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:24,080
Look. I only put my hand on his shoulder, that's all!

586
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,310
What century are we in? I want to know what did I do wrong?

587
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,070
You're the pillar of the company.

588
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,880
Have you treated me like a pillar?

589
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,240
The new program was given to the online influencer while my program didn't even get funding.

590
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,130
You need to learn to understand. There is a lot of competition right now.

591
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:44,100
It's very difficult for the company. We're also considering our next business transformation.

592
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,660
Then, why can't I transform?

593
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,590
Why am I always outside of the company's considerations?

594
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,050
Regardless of what's happened these years,

595
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,810
I've never dared post on Weibo or to social media.

596
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,560
I was scared of people taking screenshots and causing malicious speculation!

597
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,740
I didn't care if I was happy or sad, or whatever I was going through.

598
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,850
I never dared share my emotions outside.

599
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,810
To the point where I don't even dare tell my dad anything when I get home.

600
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,210
I'm scared that my dad will be worried and get angry.

601
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,780
Gao Tai, if you could see inside my mind,

602
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,690
you would definitely see the stomach full of

603
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,400
all that I've chewed up and shoved inside.
