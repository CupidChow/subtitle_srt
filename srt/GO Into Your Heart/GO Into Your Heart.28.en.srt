162
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,400
our two baby girls

163
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,330
are the best gift you gave me.

164
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,130
It seems every time I'm sad,

165
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,540
I'll see you.

166
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,410
You shouldn't be alone when you're sad anyway.

167
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,460
Especially on a day like this.

168
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,290
But today is the day...

169
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,350
I want to be alone.

170
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,020
Someone has to be with you.

171
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,740
You're different than I am.

172
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,310
I can tell

173
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,270
that you were a happy kid.

174
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,660
Didn't have much to worry or stress about.

175
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,550
You could do anything you wanted.

176
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,720
Whatever you want to do, you just go do it.

177
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,120
You like GO, so you flew back from abroad.

178
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,450
And when I like someone,

179
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,560
I move towards them without regard for anything else.

180
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,810
You cry as you like, laugh as you please.

181
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,400
It's like no matter what conflict or difficulties you encounter,

182
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,970
you're never worried.

183
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,980
Who says I'm not worried?

184
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,330
You just don't see it, that's all.

185
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,340
The day my mom died,

186
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,920
to me, it was a turning point in my life.

187
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,790
It felt like that day, my childhood seemed to end.

188
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,030
I became an adult overnight.

189
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,530
Because I wanted to take care of my dad and my sister,

190
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:00,980
so I had to grow up, toughen up, and work hard.

191
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,810
Sometimes, I really am exhausted.

192
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,080
So every year, I take today off,

193
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,360
and come here to be alone, quietly,

194
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,190
to see the ocean, feel the breeze, and space out.

195
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,040
You really have been exhausted.

196
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,660
You live life too meticulously

197
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,650
and force yourself to become someone else.

198
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,870
Just like in order to keep the persona of a perfect host,

199
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,180
you gave up sugar.

200
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,750
I've seen Cheng Liao's cooking competition.

201
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,890
She was right.

202
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,210
Delicious food has the power to cure people's hearts.

203
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,240
However, you ask for too much from yourself,

204
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,780
a lot of the sweet parts of life,

205
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,290
you've excluded from your life.

206
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,590
No matter if it's Uncle Cheng or Cheng Liao,

207
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,910
or even your mother,

208
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,860
they wouldn't want to see you burned out like this.

209
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,530
Because these responsibilities aren't yours alone to bear.

210
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,510
They're all adults.

211
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,560
They can be responsible for themselves.

212
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,720
And you?

213
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,750
You ask for too much.

214
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,060
You ask them to be like what you expect

215
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,850
or it's your fault.

216
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,070
You wish the whole world to be like how you imagine it.

217
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,430
These requests are only in your imagination,

218
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,890
they're completely useless.

219
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,350
I think you should relax a little.

220
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,810
You don't have to be that great...

221
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,660
or be responsible for everything.

222
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,810
As long as you're happy every day, it's fine.

223
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,600
To have someone next to me...

224
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,140
is actually better than being alone.

225
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,890
♫ The world suddenly became calm ♫

226
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,620
♫ You walked past me ♫

227
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:55,330
♫ Disappearing quietly, your back only a silhouette ♫

228
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,140
♫ Falling into your eyes ♫

229

♫ Nowhere to hide from the longing ♫

230

♫ Waiting for that moment when the wind blows,

♫ Missing it over and over again ♫

♫ There's no one like me ♫

241
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,630
The subscriber you dialed is not available.

242
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:03,980
Sorry the subscriber you dialed—
♫ Checkmate my sincere heart and break it open ♫

243
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:24,070
The weather is getting cold. Have some Pu'er tea to detox.

244
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,180
There's also fleece flower root and China-root. Soak it in water and drink it.

245
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,300
It gives you energy and is an antioxidant. It can also darken your hair.

246
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,450
Really...

247
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,310
Let's talk about it. Why aren't you going on the tour?

248
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,690
This is one of the rare games with slow GO rules.

249
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,640
It'd be a shame if you missed it.

250
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,350
Also, going to Qingdao, by the sea,

251
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,590
when the ocean breeze blows on you,

252
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,770
and you have a small bottle of beer,

253
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,530
and also eat some stir-fried clams,

254
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,370
you'll feel so great.

255
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,530
Just treat it as a vacation.

256
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,990
To be honest, Senior Brother,

257
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,540
I'm not doing so well lately.

258
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,660
Xiao Ke,

259
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,180
it's... been a while since the 10-Game GO match. It's not worth it, is it?

260
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,580
It has nothing to do with the 10-Game GO match. It's my own problem.

261
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,070
Also, I don't need the ranking score. What's more,

262
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,350
Jiuzhou has lots of talented players. You don't need me.

263
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,280
What I'm afraid of is, if I attend the competition

264
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,270
and lose a game, the media will make a fuss again. Wouldn't they?

265
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,360
Just leave it. I'll do it for you.

266
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,220
You never pack it right.

267
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,810
That's why I came prepared. Look!

268
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,270
Look at all the stuff I prepared for you.

269
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,600
Why did you bring so much food?

270
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,730
Geez.

271
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,210
This time... I got your favorite Mika Mika Japanese cheesecake.

272
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,620
And these cookies.

273
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,360
Freeze-dried fruit, I have all the flavors for you!

274
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,860
I can barely fit the clothes. There's no room for that.

275
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,000
Before, when you wanted to eat these, you couldn't get them.

276
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,470
Even when you could, the brands were wrong.

277
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,300
These are your favorite; just take some. You don't have to carry them.

278
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,190
I'm not eating them right now. If I gain any more weight, I won't be able to fit in my clothes anymore.

279
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,310
Where are you gaining weight?

280
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,580
But you have to at least take these with you, right?

281
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,540
Neck pillow. The stuffed toy you sleep with.

282
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
I also bought a lot of beverages for you.

283
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,700
Oh, look.

284
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,740
Bro, am I running away?

285
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,390
Just hurry and pack up your own stuff.

286
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,730
- Got it.
- We're leaving soon. Hurry up.

287
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,710
Leave those.

288
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
[Qingdao]

289
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,600
Thank you. Thank you.

290
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,800
Which room do you want to stay in?

291
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
They are all the same. You decide.

292
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
I decide?

293
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,100
Take one room back, thanks.

294
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
You mustn't let Mr. Sheng eat any seafood.

295
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
If his stomach gets upset, it'll affect his game.

296
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I already got it.

297
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,400
Even though you are his girlfriend, you are still not as good I am at taking care of him.

298
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
If anything happens, you must contact me immediately. Okay?

299
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,540
Don't nag anymore.

300
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,000
I'll definitely take good care of her.

301
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Mr. Sheng, what do you know about taking care of someone else?

302
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,670
It's true that I don't know how to take care of other people.

303
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,900
Because I only know to take care of her.

304
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,200
Mr. Sheng. Miss Cheng. This is your room card.

305
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

306
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,600
Just... one room card?

307
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,300
The system shows that the two of you registered for one room.

308
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
- One room?
- One room?

309
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Did Xiao Qi make a mistake?

310
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,100
No, he didn't make a mistake. It's one room.

311
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,200
Wow.

312
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,800
- Please bring up the luggage.
- Okay.

313
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,150
This view is amazing.

314
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,880
[I Love You]

315
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,070
Are you really sleeping on the sofa?

316
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,500
You were only just injured. I can't let you out of my sight.

317
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,570
So I especially asked Xiao Qi to reserve a suite for us.

318
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,400
But I didn't realize he would overwork his brain

319
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,200
and make his own decisions.

320
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,200
But don't worry, I'll just sleep on the sofa.

321
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,600
No way! I'd better tell the front desk to get another room for me.

322
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,200
No. You're a national GO player,

323
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
how can I let you sleep on the sofa?

324
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Tomorrow is the press conference.

325
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,800
If you don't get a good rest, then you won't look as great.

326
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,000
We can't lose our killer energy when we take a photo together.

327
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,600
If you sleep on the sofa

328
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,100
and it affects your game, then I won't be able to carry the guilt.

329
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,200
- I don't mind.
- I do!

330
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,500
Okay then.

331
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Since you care about me so much, we'll both sleep in the bed.

332
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Wait! You should think it over.

333
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,200
No, wait, do you really mean it?

334
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Liao Liao.

335
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,000
Panda Bear.

336
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,820
Let's chat.

337
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
Okay.

338
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,600
How did you think of the method to build city walls?
(T/N: Implying a physical barrier between them.)

339
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Have you watched a lot of idol dramas?

340
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,870
I did borrow a scene from others.

341
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,400
But it's not from idol dramas. It's an old movie.

342
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,300
What's it called?

343
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,300
Tell me. What is it called?

344
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,040
I can't tell you.

345
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,630
Tell me. What is it called?

346
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,510
It Happened One Night.

347
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,800
You'd better not say it. Go to sleep.

348
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,200
[Super Slow GO Tournament - Qingdao]

349
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
This Super Slow GO Tournament Qingdao Site

350
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
has gathered all the young players from around the country, including 9-dan Sheng Jingchu

351
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,600
leading the Jiuzhou Hall's team to participate in the games.

352
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,800
This match is using the slow-playing rules that are rare in the country.

353
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,000
Each side gets eight hours to play the game.

354
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,200
with five one-minute countdowns.

355
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
If they are not finished by six o'clock that day,

356
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,410
they'll seal the board. On the next day at 9:00 in the morning,

357
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,200
they'll continue until the game is finished.

358
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,200
It's heard that the young Chinese female player, 5-dan He Yu, who moved abroad a few years ago,

359
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,200
made a special trip to compete in the tournament.

360
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,700
She is setting this as an important milestone for her return to the domestic GO arena.

361
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,380
Currently 4-dan, Ding Lan, and 6-dan, Yang Yunfei

362
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,200
have entered into the middle stages of a fierce battle.

363
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,090
I think Ding Lan's formation looks good.

364
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,800
The battle in the center will determine this game.

365
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,400
Right now, every move is crucial.

366
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,200
Our two players have frequently been mired into long thoughts.

367
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,600
Even though this Super Slow GO Tournament allows

368
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,800
for slow playing over two days,

369
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,400
but up to this point,

370
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,800
there still hasn't been a game that's taken two days.

371
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,800
If 4-dan, Ding Lan, and 6-dan, Yang Yufei continue to be at a stalemate like this,

372
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,200
it's very likely that we'll see the rare sealing of the board.

373
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200
Time to seal the board.

374
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Please sign.

375
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,800
Why can't we go over there?

376
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
This is a rule for sealing the board.

377
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,500
Before the game is resumed,

378
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,400
the game players cannot communicate with the other players in the tournament, or it's a violation of rules.

379
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,600
But what if Xiao Lan is hungry? She still can't come out?

380
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Don't worry.

381
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,300
The committee will have the hotel deliver food to her room.

382
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm concerned that silly girl will only think about practicing GO instead of eating.

383
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Let's go. Come to my place to drink some tea.

384
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,500
Let's go.

385
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,870
My current situation isn't bad.

386
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,230
He's playing the shoulder hit tactic to limit my potential territory.

387
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,200
In the end, my plays were still too much,

388
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,300
too aggressive, not leaving room for me.

389
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,000
If I had been a little calmer, this move would have been safer.

390
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,600
He'll probably want to capture my stone here.

391
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,500
Where will his next move be?

392
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,800
Fly here.

393
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,600
Then I'll...

394
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
rely on this.

395
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,800
If he reaches around,

396
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
I'll break it.

397
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,800
If he stretches,

398
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,780
then neither side will have a way back.

399
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,000
I already said that I don't need anything!

400
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,100
Don't come to bother me!

401
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,100
Sister Cheng Liao!

402
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,610
It's fine. I'm not a GO player. I'm the media.

403
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,880
Besides, there hasn't been a sealing of the board in such a long time.

404
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,130
So I applied for an interview.

405
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,610
They said, as long as someone is monitoring,

406
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,430
and you agree, it'll be fine.

407
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,650
So I came by to chat with you and relieve the boredom.

408
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,920
Wow, Miss Cheng, you're too smart and too quick-witted.

409
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,370
Let me tell you. If you hadn't come tonight, I would've tormented myself to death.

410
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,650
Actually, Cao Xihe is the one who can't stay calm.

411
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,300
He's worried that you'd be thinking of GO and wouldn't eat your dinner.

412
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,800
At least he has a basic understanding of me.

413
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,870
- You really haven't eaten?
- I'm not hungry.

414
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,550
It was such a tight race today, you must be exhausted.

415
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,470
How could you not eat?

416
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,880
I'm not tired!

417
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,100
Not only am I not tired, but I'm also 100 times more energetic than usual.

418
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,900
Sister Cheng Liao, ever since I set a goal to advance to 7 dan,

419
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,130
I've been going to any competition that I could go to.

420
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,620
Even though it's hard to win when I play against a male player,

421
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,510
but I've already reached the point of sealing the board in today's game.

422
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,190
My formation is still good.

423
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,800
It means that the gap between me and Yang Yunfei isn't that big.

424
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,580
It's possible for me to defeat him.

425
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,640
I lack only one game to accumulate the score to advance my level.

426
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,320
That's why if I can defeat Yang Yunfei tomorrow,

427
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,730
I'll be able to advance to 5 dan. I'm one step closer to 7 dan. How could I possibly be tired?

428
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,020
Our Xiao Lan can definitely become like your idol,

429
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,870
becoming the most awesome female player.

430
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,750
I want to break down those stereotypical ideas that some people have about female GO players.

431
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,920
Such comments like lacking the big picture, sentimental thinking, keen to fight,

432
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,210
I admit that I have all those problems.

433
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,700
But so what? I want to become like my idol

434
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,130
- and open up a new world.
- Exactly. I support you.

435
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,830
Go forward and defeat them.

436
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,390
Cheers!

437
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,220
Relax.

438
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,530
It's fine.

439
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,850
Sister Cheng Liao, I don't want you to leave.

440
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,060
It would be so good if you could stay here with me.

441
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,960
You should hurry and get some rest. You still have to play tomorrow.

442
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,400
Do your best!

443
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,610
Don't worry. I'm going then.

444
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,660
I'm really going.

445
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,700
Go on.

446
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,450
But I still want to stay a little longer.

447
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,950
Hurry and go to sleep. Okay?

448
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,110
You should rest early, too.

449
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,610
That's right.

450
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,480
You're in the same room with Senior Brother Jing. Then you can't sleep early.

451
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,810
How did I forget?

452
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,720
Sure, don't worry. I'm okay.

453
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,390
Hurry and go back. Senior Brother Jing is still waiting for you.

454
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,240
I'm going.

455
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,050
Bye-bye.

456
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,510
Why are you here?

457
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,760
I'm back.

458
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,470
How is Xiao Lan?

459
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,130
Full of energy.

460
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,410
She's just a little clingy.

461
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,430
You worked hard.

462
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,540
I finally understand how hard it's been for my older sister all these years.

463
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,180
It's so tiring to be an older sister.

464
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,570
What are you doing here?

465
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,220
Sister Cheng Liao has already fully consoled my heart.

466
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,390
I came to console your stomach.

467
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,330
I knew you definitely wouldn't be sleeping,

468
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,460
resting, or eating well.

469
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,260
I worry regardless of who came. I have to personally watch over you.

470
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,820
Look.

471
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,780
Here.

472
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,530
Eat.

473
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,930
How did you sneak in?

474
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,250
I knew that Sister-in-Law was interviewing you today.

475
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,760
So I used the chance to use the public phone in the lobby

476
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,910
to call the front desk, telling them that you were going out.

477
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,120
Could the cleaning lady come in to clean up the room a bit?

478
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,160
While the cleaning lady wasn't paying attention, I sneaked right in.

479
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,460
So well thought out.

480
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,160
You could be an assassin.

481
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,200
Do you like assassins?

482
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,010
A masked or unmasked one? Would he carry a blade or a sword? Or does he use hidden weapons?

483
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,650
- Next time, I can—
- Stop!

484
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,050
You can stay just a little while and leave quickly.

485
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,580
Don't playact and absolutely do not discuss GO with me.

486
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,550
I want to defeat him with my own strength.

487
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,470
Hurry and eat.

488
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,440
You're a man, so how did you ask for a cleaning lady for my room?

489
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,420
That's easy.

490
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,020
Watch.

491
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,290
Hello, front desk?

492
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,210
This is 1116.

493
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,990
Solved.

494
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,330
Senior Brother He, you know something?

495
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,010
You've playacted so many ways,

496
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,350
that one you just did was my favorite.

497
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,710
Okay, go to sleep then.

498
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,390
Close your eyes.

499
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,390
Senior Brother He.

500
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,590
I can't sleep.

501
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,820
Xiao Lan, you've calculated so many variations already.

502
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,910
So many choices and you've calculated them all.

503
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,320
So, don't worry. You'll definitely win tomorrow.

504
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,860
Really?

505
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,770
I'm a professional 8 dan. Believe me.

506
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,750
Okay, sleep. Sleep, okay? Lay down.

507
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,950
Don't think wild thoughts, or you won't be able to sleep.

508
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:36,950
Rest well today, so you can be in your best condition to win the game tomorrow.

509
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,560
I'll stay with you. Sleep.

510
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,190
Goodnight.

511
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,240
Xiao Lan guessed it right.

512
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,890
I thought you were sitting over there.

513
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:28,530
Sorry. When Xiao Lan's predictions are impressive, I get a little too excited.

514
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,150
Senior Brother Jing, look at Xiao Lan's moves reviving the center,

515
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,930
do you think she's got control of the game?

516
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,380
But you still can't hurt the innocent.

517
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,470
Neither side can go back now.

518
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,690
Ding Lan's settling of the weak group is directly affecting the win or loss of this game.

519
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:23,380
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

520
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,350
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

521
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:32,160
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

522

♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

524
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,570
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

525
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:48,110
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

526
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:52,190
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

527
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:58,090
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

528
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:04,220
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

529
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,230
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

530
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:22,810
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

531
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:44,800
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

532
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,770
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

533
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:53,300
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

534
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,080
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

535
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,120
♫ There is color all around you ♫

536
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,690
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

537
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:09,300
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

538
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:17,720
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

539
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:27,540
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

540
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,460
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

541
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:37,400
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

542
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:43,400
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon and flying far because of your talent ♫

543
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,490
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

544
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:53,370
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

545
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:59,690
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

546
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,420
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

547
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:19,270
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
