Senior Brother, if you have any interviews that you don't want to go to later,

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,490
just hand them to me. I'll block all of them for you.

Editor Cheng, why are you filming even when we are playing Mahjong?

41
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,170
Mr. Ke Jie said that

42
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,100
when I'm here, it's easier for him to defeat Sheng Jingchu.

43
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,240
No, no! I only asked her to show the way.

44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,330
The studio is very large, I couldn't find the exit.

45
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,400
I don't need any tricks to defeat Sheng Jingchu.

46

I'll just roll over him.

47
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,960
Keke, the new topic that you talked about

48
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,630
is really boring.

49
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,420
Xiao Jing, you are good at everything

50
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,920
except that you are no fun at all.

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,240
You can't only think about GO games every day.

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,600
Master Xie is right to let you move out of Jiuzhou Hall.

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,830
Life really isn't only about GO games.

54
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,010
Otherwise, you become too limited.

55
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,460
You need to explore new areas,

56
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,320
and use the knowledge from the new areas to enrich your world of GO.

57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,690
This is the correct way of GO.

58

Sheng Jingchu, when I have my comeback,

59

- I will take back Tianyuan.
 (T/N: Tianyuan GO championship)

Keke, my Senior Brother Jing isn't easy to defeat.

I can achieve whatever I want to.

62
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,780
Then, take another Six Wan.

63
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,830
That? I don't have much confidence either.

64
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,120

67
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,160
- I gave out three Six Wan, you only just won?
- I wanted to win on this tile.

68
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,320
Keke, I just wanted to tell you this.

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,290
Many things are beyond your expectation.

70
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,230
If you want to take back Tianyuan, you have to ask me if I agree.

71
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,840
You'll have to wait for me to graduate first. Don't be too anxious.

72
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,600
Oh, yes! Cao Xihe, you were nagging me on the way today.

What did you want to ask me?

74

I only wanted to sincerely ask you a question.

75
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,420
How can I become so popular like you?

76
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,700
Two words: be yourself.

77
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,250
I've been being myself for 25 years.

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,440
That's not long enough. Keep persevering.

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,600
Do you have to be so excited?

82
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,580
You don't get it.

83
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,160
It's my honor to receive tips from my idol.

84
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,260
Oh, right! He is two years younger than me.

85
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,410
Why is he so popular?

86
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,130
Why should I continue to persevere?

87
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,200
It's because you are not being yourself.

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,200
An intellectual guy for a while, then you're a domineering CEO for another.

89
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,400
- Xiehe.
- Senior Brother.

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,380
You take Xiao Lan back to school, I'll take Cheng Liao back.

91
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,760
Let's go.

92
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,370
- Senior Sister-in-Law, safe travel.
- Are you done yet?

93
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,060
- Hungry?
- A little.

94
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,140
I'll take you to eat.

95
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,520
What are you looking at?

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,660
Senior Brother He, I have an ominous feeling.

97
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,670
What do you mean?

98
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,160
I feel that I'll be scolded.

99
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,980
Think about it. When the program was being recorded,

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,870
Senior Brother Jing quickly found Cheng Liao's fingerprint

101
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,980
from among all those complicated fingerprints.

102
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,670
Do you know what this is called in an idol drama?

103
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
It's fated.

104
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,280
This kind of fated couple cannot be stopped.

105
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,370
If I keep trying to stop them,

106
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,560
I'll become a vicious villain. I'll probably be scolded.

107
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,660
Will this happen?

108
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,400
- Here's a blanket for you.
- Thank you.

109
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,050
I'll toast you.

110
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,160
Today, if it weren't for you, mankind would be doomed.

111
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,280
It was really by luck today.

112
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,990
If they found anyone else,

113
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,730
even though I could find that person, it wouldn't be this quick.

114
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,490
But they happened to find you.

115
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,670
Me? What is it about me?

116
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,690
Hold out your hand.

117
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,580
When you made the Sister Song's Fish Soup for me in Suzhou,

118
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,670
this is the wound you got.

119
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,600
I would have forgotten if you didn't mention it.

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,730
Such a tiny wound,

121
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,160
so small that even a mosquito probably can see,

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,650
and it's mixed with the fingerprints. You're so awesome.

123
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,120
To me, this is like cheating.

124
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,570
There really is a difference between a person and a god. Here.

125
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,370
I admire you.

126
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,750
You didn't know your ex-boyfriend to be so awesome, right?

127
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm just joking.

128
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,050
No.

129
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,640
I should be the one to apologize.

130
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,190
I was too much in a hurry rushing about today, so I didn't want to explain more.

131
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,190
- Don't be angry.
- I'm not angry.

132
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,640
I often speak without control. My mouth keeps getting me into trouble.

133
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,840
Next time, if someone asks, I will definitely and seriously tell them

134
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,960
that we are only friends.

135
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,100
Friends? Only?

136
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,060
See? I'm in trouble again.

137
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,170
Even though the word "friend" seems superficial,

138
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,400
but it's really my honor to be called a friend by the GO god.

139
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,900
Friend... Does it sound superficial?

140
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,530
Perhaps it's because I've been called a friend too many times,

141
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,410
so it feels a bit superficial.

142
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,250
Before I was six years old,

143
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,540
I probably had two friends.

144
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,150
After I was six, I came to Jiuzhou Hall.

145
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,990
Other than Master and GO,

146
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,420
there were only fellow disciple brothers.

147
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,180
There were no other playmates.

148
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,550
I didn't attend a regular school either.

149
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,770
So, if you count it this way,

150
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,580
you are my first meaningful friend.

151
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,060
I told you we were friends that day.

152
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,600
It's because you are very precious to me.

153
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,380
The word "friend" carries

154
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,370
a lot of weight in my heart.

155
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,250
Ever since I've been grown,

156
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,740
this is the first time I'm touched by the word "friend."

157
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,810
Starting today,

158
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,110
you are also a very, very precious friend of mine.

159
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,600
Here.

160
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,320
Let's eat.

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,600
The 1st episode has over 100 million viewers!

163
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,290
Shush!

164
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,930
We've received raving reviews from the media,

165
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,830
and we also uplifted Binhai TV's viewership to a new high.

166
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,010
Binhai TV speaks very highly of our team.

167
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,660
They've decided to continue our future collaboration.

168
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,970
VP Xu, your first project has become the talk of the town.

169
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,840
Outstanding!

170
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,650
Would you like to have a word?

171
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,080
Sure.

172
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,230
This is a team effort for this show's success.

173
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,330
I hope we can keep it up.

174
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,340
Also, I have good news to share with everyone.

175
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,030
There're few big companies that are showing their interest in being our major sponsor.

176
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,910
Yan Xiao,

177
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,140
can you do a follow up all the commercial inquiries?

178
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,890
On it!

179
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,740
Finally, I am here to compliment Cheng Liao's effort

180
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,740
to convince Sheng Jingchu to participate in our show.

181
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,540
Cheng Liao's contribution is the key to the show's success.

182
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,580
Cheng Liao.

183
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,950
Yes!

184
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,910
Cheng Liao, after much deliberation between Director Liu and I,

185
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,250
starting today, you are a formal employee at Pinecone Video.

186
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,510
Thank you, VP Xu! Thank you, Director Liu! I will keep up the good work.

187
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,570
Here is your employee card.

188
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,390
And this is a gift from me.

189
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,760
Thank you.

190
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,640
Fighting!

191
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,280
Take a seat.

192
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,690
Your work now has become your first love.

193
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,680
In order to show my gratitude, I've reserved a party room at Xing Yue Hotel this Saturday.

194
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,000
I hope everyone here can make it.

195
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,270
Thank you, VP Xu!

196
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,310
The three of us used to come here very often.

197
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,930
My sister and I still come here regularly.

198
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,850
After all these years, the taste here remains the same. Still wonderful.

199
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,760
I see you and your sister's appetite hasn't changed much.

200
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,480
When you like something,

201
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,270
it's not easy to change.

202
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,970
But for some people,

203
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,350
when they like something, they hide their feelings.

204
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,470
When that feeling is buried too deep,

205
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,350
they don't know how to dig it out.

206
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,790
Tell me.

207
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,570
Are you hiding a secret?

208
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,670
Who are you hiding?

209
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,580
Okay.

210
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,260
I'll tell you.

211
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,770
I've liked this girl for a very long time.

212
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,030
I want to confess to her,

213
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,850
but I don't know how to start.

214
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,520
Perhaps, she doesn't even know I've been liking her for a long time.

215
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,220
Then, maybe she knew about it but is waiting for your confession.

216
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,170
What if I confess to her and she rejects me?

217
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,010
I don't think she'll turn you down.

218
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,760
If I don't say a word,

219
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,160
it'll just be me feeling lonely.

220
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,560
I can still stand by her, be her friend.

221
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
But if she rejected me,

222
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,040
it'll be awkward between the both of us.

223
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,050
I'm afraid we can't see each other anymore.

224
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,960
You blockhead! The clues are so obvious!

225
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,950
Let me think about it.

226
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,790
Keep eating, I'm going to pay.

227
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,270
Okay.

228
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,750
I'm dying here.

229
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,210
Don't tell me I need to make the move first.

230
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,610
What's going on?

231
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,570
What happened?

232
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,330
What's going on?

233
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,520
Stabbed to death.

234
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,570
Who died?

235
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,150
Phoenix was killed by his wife.

236
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,460
Who is Phoenix?

237
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,590
It's Xiang Mi.
 (He's talking about "Ashes of Love")

238
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,430
Phoenix and Little Grapes.

239
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,900
This drama is such torture.

240
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,160
I'm crying from exhaustion.

241
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,310
Old Cheng, how can you be so emotionally engaged in a TV drama at your age?

242
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,830
How sad is it?

243
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,510
You don't understand.

244
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,200
The torment is that Phoenix and Little Grapes

245
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,480
love each other but they keep missing their timing.

246
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,120
They both loved each other,

247
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,140
but they missed their timing.

248
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,350
They fell in love,

249
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,910
they could be together.

250
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,900
And that's the beginning of the torture.

251
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,880
Little Grapes stabbed and killed Phoenix.

252
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,500
Tell me! What are you waiting for? Just say it!

253
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,410
If they confessed, tragedy wouldn't be happening.

254
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,570
In conclusion, if you don't say a word, you'll really miss your chance.

255
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,930
That's right! This is killing me!

256
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,300
This drama is so good! Who's the director?

257
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,760
I don't think I can wait any longer.

258
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:59,500
When I confess, what should I give Brother Xu?

259
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,430
After the successful confession,

260
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,450
I don't have to call him "Brother."

261
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,560
Xu Chi?

262
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,930
Chi?

263
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,410
Our Chi?

264
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,960
I feel so bashful.

265
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,490
Hello? GO God.

266
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,550
Can you do me a favor?

267
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,540
Can you help me pick a gift?

268
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,070
What a coincidence.

269
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,930
What's a coincidence?

270
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,110
Nothing.

271
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,050
I'm afraid my taste is not up to standard.

272
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,630
I have confidence in you.

273
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,660
If you trust me, I'll help our GO God.

274
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,590
Thank you!

275
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,870
I will send you the address.

276
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,980
Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye!

277
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,720
During the competition, I remember Yao Ke had a teacup next to him.

278
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
I think he likes tea.

279
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,910
Also, this tea set compliments his style.

280
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,030
I think he'll like it.

281
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,320
Let's go with your choice. It can't be wrong.

282
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,630
Let me carry it.

283
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,220
My mission has been accomplished!

284
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,030
What do you want to eat? I'll take you to dinner.

285
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,340
Do you have a budget limit?

286
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,910
Unlimited.

287
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,540
I really need to think about it.

288
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,790
GO God, can you do me a favor, too?

289
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,170
Let's go!

290
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,200
What do you think about this?

291
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,400
Not bad. A gift for your dad?

292
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,110
It's for Brother Xu.

293
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,390
It's for his birthday?

294
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,540
A confession gift.

295
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,760
I've decided...

296
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,900
to confess to Brother Xu tonight.

297
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,700
To tell you the truth. All these years,

298
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,100
we've been liking each other.

299
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,840
He knows I like cakes.

300
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,430
Even when he was out of town,

301
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,870
he will always think of me.

302
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,790
He ordered me different kinds of popular cakes.

303
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,380
Up until recently,

304
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,380
I realized the reason why he doesn't want to confess

305
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,470
is because he is afraid of rejection.

306
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,420
Then we could no longer be friends.

307
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,120
If he is concerned about that, let me make the move first.

308
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,220
Do I look desperate to take the initiative?

309
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,790
I'm telling you this because I consider you as my friend,

310
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,690
I haven't even told Yan Xiao.

311
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,170
Give me some ideas. What do you think about this tie?

312
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,590
- It's fine.
- It's fine?

313
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,680
How about this style?

314
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,640
It's fine.

315
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,040
It's fine?

316
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,450
I don't think so.

317
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,430
Let me keep looking.

318
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,490
How about this?

319
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,920
- It's fine.
- How come everything is fine?

320
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,850
What about this one?

321
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,990
It's fine.

322
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,960
This one is good.

323
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,500
It's fine.

324
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,540
I thought that bringing you here would speed up the process, but it ends up worse than doing it on my own.

325
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,190
- Quick, what do you think?
- It's all fine.

326
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,110
It's all fine again? Help me out, which one's the best?

327
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,910
Something happened, I'm heading out now.

328
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,920
- Is it urgent?
- Yeah.

329
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,120
Goodbye.

330
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,780
I've decided to confess to Brother Xu tonight.

331
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,420
Mr. Sheng, are you interested in constellations as well?

332
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,010
[My elder daughter prepared ginseng tea for me, I feel loved and warmed.]

333
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,540
Just wear your usual style.

334
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,910
Can't you knock before you enter?

335
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,130
You came out of nowhere.

336
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,800
Even if I weren't sick, I'd be scared sick.

337
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,310
What are you wearing?

338
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,020
Me?

339
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,490
Just this.

340
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,270
Just that? Aren't you supposed to dress up to attend?

341
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,680
If Old Xu didn't beg me, I wouldn't even go.

342
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,750
Hey, Sis. Don't you have a lot of formal dresses?

343
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,480
Why?

344
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,890
I'm not letting you borrow any. You could rent, but the fee is high.

345
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,220
Please let me borrow one.

346
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,040
I'll return it after washing it.

347
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,570
Let me borrow it, and I'll do whatever you want.

348
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,510
- No.
- Please?

349
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,790
- ¥250 an hour.
- I don't have the money, you are so silly.

350
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,230
¥280?

351
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,290
It's one thing to be upset, but you shouldn't go away without saying anything.

352
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,190
You should hurry and tell her.

353
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,730
This is all just a misunderstanding!

354
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,940
She was overthinking it. You should tell her clearly and save her.

355
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,250
Uncle Cheng. Uncle Cheng?

356
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,570
- GO God?
- Sorry to bother you.

357
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,800
Why are you here?

358
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,490
Come, come! Sit inside.

359
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,440
Boss, the check.

360
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,100
Coming.

361
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,420
Wait a moment.

362
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,630
- ¥86. You're an old customer, just give ¥80.
- Okay.

363
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,750
Scan the code.

364
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,220
Uncle Cheng, why isn't Cheng Liao here?

365
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,340
She didn't pick up my phone call.

366
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,730
Cheng Liao? She went out with her older sister.

367
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,800
They were going to Xu Chi's celebration banquet.

368
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,350
You need anything?

369
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,780
Nothing.

370
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,220
GO God, if you are free anytime, just come to my little restaurant.

371
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,390
You can make my little store hotter.

372
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,550
I can rub off some of your internet popularity.

373
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:46,320
Uncle Cheng, did Cheng Liao buy this tea set?

374
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,990
You mean this?

375
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,180
She didn't buy it. She doesn't have this kind of taste.

376
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,230
Amazing.

377
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,930
You two beauty's brilliance is blinding my eyes.

378
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,590
We came to support Vice President Xu, of course we need to be more formal.

379
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,230
No, no, no. When you call me Vice President, I feel my scalp is numb and my back is chilled.

380
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,510
It's an ominous feeling that I'm about to get a beating.

381
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,410
You know your place.

382
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,560
Who is this little beauty? Zhiliao?

383
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,740
You are almost too pretty tonight.

384
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,790
I almost didn't recognize you.

385
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,210
Really?

386
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,670
You're absolutely the prettiest girl here...

387
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,750
One of the prettiest.

388
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,700
You're something. How dare you ignore me in public now? Are you asking for a beating?

389
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,740
Brother Xu Chi is only complimenting me a little bit.

390
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,890
You two can enter first. I still need to take care of other guests.

391
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,520
Pardon me.

392
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,870
What's the matter with you?

393
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,800
Your elbow is turning out.
 (T/N: helping outsiders)

394
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,780
I'm not doing that. You are the prettiest today.

395
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,280
[Tea set and tablecloth]

396
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,820
[Xiao Yi's new purchases]

397
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,770
[My eldest daughter bought them for me]

398
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,600
He never dared to confess to me.

399
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,980
He's afraid that if he confessed and I would reject him.

400
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,750
We wouldn't even be friends.

401
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,670
Since he doesn't dare to take that step, I'll take the step.

402
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,200
What's the matter?

403
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,130
Why is your face so white?

404
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,830
Are you cold?

405
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,000
Where is Xu Chi's celebration banquet?

406
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,600
No need, thanks.

407
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,010
Let's toast VP Xu.

408
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,330
Drink slowly.

409
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,270
I don't know why but I'm so thirsty today.

410
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,540
To tell you the truth,

411
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,060
I keep feeling thirsty today, too.

412
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,270
I'm going to the restroom.

413
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,800
- Let's chat next time.
- Okay.

414
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,560
No need, thanks.

415
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,710
What's going on with the two of you?

416
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:13,320
You've never seen such a crowd, or you've never drunk champagne? So thirsty.

417
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,790
I'm a little nervous, so I'm drinking a little more to relax.

418
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,160
Don't give me that.

419
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,050
Vice President Xu, haven't you seen any grand occasion all these years?

420
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:26,060
But I kind of like this small stage and this small orchestra.

421
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,030
It's good as long as you like it.

422
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,490
Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.

423
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,680
Cheng Liao, you're not nervous at all.

424
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,730
It's nothing to panic about.

425
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,870
He's already said that he likes you.

426
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,860
It's just that you need to confess first.

427
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,360
When it comes to love, someone has to be more courageous.

428
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,000
Don't be a wimp.

429
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,930
Stay calm.

430
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,340
[Cheng Liao]

431
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,640
Why are you nervous? Isn't it just a celebration banquet?

432
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,510
Something on your mind?

433
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,860
They should be coming soon.

434
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,240
Let's go eat some.

435
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,660
I don't know.

436
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,410
I don't know either.

437
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,240
What are you doing?

438
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,100
Drinking to boost the beauty's courage.

439
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,840
Are you going on stage? To sing or to dance?

440
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,110
To tell a story.

441
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,770
Why is she going there?

442
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,900
Who knows?

443
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,940
Mister, drive faster.

444
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Just now,

445
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,400
Yan Xiao asked me why I was coming up here.

446
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,600
I said,

447
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,800
I... I want to tell a story.

448
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,400
Is Zhiliao okay?

449
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,800
It's fine. She's just a kid. What could be wrong with her?

450
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,000
Just let her have some fun.

451
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,100
Actually, I've thought

452
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,700
a long time about this story.

453
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,700
I don't even know how to tell it.

454
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm not a very literary person.

455
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,800
So...

456
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:32,460
I'm using that glutton in my heart to say,

457
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
I particularly like to eat.

458
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,200
I like pears stewed in rock sugar.

459
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,000
I like to eat mashed double potatoes,

460
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,800
strawberry coconut cake, cheese-corn,

461
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,400
and...

462
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,200
I won't say so much.

463
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,700
It's just that

464
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,500
I feel that even when all the delicious foods in the world are put together,

465
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,400
they still don't match up to you.

466
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,580
This kid can't be confessing, could she?

467
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,800
Actually, I've wanted to tell this secret

468
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,200
for a long time already.

469
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,700
It's so long that I'm a little scared.

470
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,550
I'm scared that

471
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,020
if I don't say it,

472
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,400
the two of us will keep staying apart

473
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,380
and keep wasting time.

474
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,580
And then we'll miss the chance.

475
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,700
Therefore, I want to say...

476
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,100
I like you.

477
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Are you willing to be with me?

478
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,590
Of course I do!

479
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Sheng Jingchu?

480
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,100
What are you doing? This is not the time to joke.

481
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,100
What are you doing?

482
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,600
Sheng Jingchu, what are you doing?

483
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,300
Let go of me!

484
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,200
What are you doing? Do you know how much determination it took for me to confess to Brother Xu Chi?

485
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,000
I only needed that last little moment. What are you doing?

486
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Xiao Yi, since there's a beautiful beginning today,

487
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,300
I'll also say what's been suppressed in my heart for many years.
