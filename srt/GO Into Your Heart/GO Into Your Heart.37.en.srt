00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,180
[Episode 27]

18
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,840
Sure.

19
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,430
But here's the thing, Senior Brother.

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,200
You don't have to agree to it just because I'm Cheng Liao's sister.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,460
You can just carefully listen to me and Yan Xiao

22
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,290
introducing the show first.

23
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,690
There's no need. I understand everything.

24
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,270
First of all, to be able to find the taste in my memories

25
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,970
already satisfies me.

26
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,170
Besides, I've been watching TV for all these years.

27
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,500
I'm very confident about the show you, Cheng Yi, recommend.

28
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,290
The more important thing is that we missed out on each other because of my hesitation and indecisiveness.

29
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,870
So, this time, I am very willing to have everyone

30
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,780
witness the love between Rumei and me.

31
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,580
Thank you, Senior Brother.

32
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,620
I have to thank you, guys.

33
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,780
We will do our best to make the show.

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,510
Now, we just have to wait for Cheng Liao to get the recipe for Macheng Fish Noodles.

35
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,410
Our Cheng Liao is very talented. She will do fine.

36
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,660
I will leave this to you.

37
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,410
I'm not teaching you.

38
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,930
Why are you pulling my hand?

39
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,410
Just let me beg Uncle Fang a little more.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,330
Don't rush.

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,010
I'm leaving.

42
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,870
Look.

43
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,470
In this round,

44
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,540
the white stones are already dead.

45
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,380
If we say that this move is here

46
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,590
were to turn around,

47
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,240
it would be bad for the white stones and you would win the game.

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,830
Actually, the noodles are not that hard to make.

49
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,850
Come when you are free and I will teach you.

50
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,690
Okay, thank you, Uncle Fang!

51
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,490
Just teach Uncle Fang a couple more tricks.

52
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,090
Hurry. Hurry.

53
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,800
Teach him.

54
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,230

♫ In the palm of your hand, spoiling you from now on ♫

74
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,590
Miss, our show is about memories and food.

75
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,100
Therefore, we will be filming in an upbeat, yet closed-off environment.

76
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,710
- You don't have to be too nervous. Just pretend we are having a little chat.
- Okay.

77
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,510
I have a question.

78
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:20,090
Are there any memorable foods that you and GO player Xie Chang'an have tried in the past?

79
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,980
The most memorable one has to be Macheng Fish Noodles.

80
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,390
- Macheng Fish Noodles?
- That's right.

81
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,250
It was a very popular little restaurant.

82
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,970
That day, I was waiting for my order. I pulled out my GO book

83
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,720
and my little GO board

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
to learn to play. And then, you know how dorky Chang'an is,

85
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,500
he came up to me and started to teach me to play without saying anything.

86
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,950
He also told me a lot of information about GO.

87
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,650
You got a private lesson from the senior brother of Jiuzhou Hall when you first started.

88
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,710
It looks like your GO skill must be exceptional.

89
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,500
No, I was only doing it for fun.

90
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,900
You know what, when we were eating the noodles together,

91
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,720
the funny part is the way and the orders we ate the noodles were the same.

92
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,170
It seems that you guys were meant for each other.

93
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,090
Maybe. It could be some type of fate.

94
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,230
Chang'an, this is...

95
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,370
What it looks like when we first met.

96
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,420
- Macheng Fish Noodles.
- Thanks.

97
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,720
Please enjoy.

98
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,440
Why do you look so familiar?

99
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,800
I think I know you as well.

100
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,170
My name is Cheng Fengshou.

101
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,970
Her name is Ye Rumei. Ru... Rumei.

102
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,050
Call him Uncle Cheng.

103
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,540
Uncle... Cheng...

104
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,570
I think the two of you are a great match.

105
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,150
- Please enjoy the noodles.
- Okay, okay.

106
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,720
Enjoy.

107
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,170
Let's try it.

108
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
This is what it used to taste like!

109
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,980
Do you still remember this road?

110
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,340
Of course, I do. Isn't this the road where I taught you how to ride a bike?

111
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,090
I remember it was this season as well.

112
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,800
Autumn. The season when the leaves fall.

113
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,290
That's right.

114
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,670
It's so beautiful.

115
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,290
How do I meet you

116
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,580
when I'm at my most handsomest?

117
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,150
For this, I've prayed to Buddha for 500 years.

118
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,560
Pray to have the luck to be with you.

119
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,260
So Buddha would turn me into a tree

120
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,530
and let me grow on the sidewalk where you pass by every day.

121
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,890
The flowers bloom under the sun with intention.

122
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,760
Every bloom is the wish I had from my previous life.

123
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,970
When you are close, please listen to

124
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,040
the shaking leaves.

125
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,300
They are the passion of me waiting for you.

126
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,290
Xi Murong (the poet).

127
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,190
Rumei,

128
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,050
we...

129
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,000
We what?

130
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,860
We are talking.

131
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,820
What about us?

132
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,720
Let's be together.

133
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,300
I really like you.

134
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,230
I've kept this sentence in my heart for too long.

135
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,060
I even believe that if I had the courage to tell you this back then,

136
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,100
we could've been together without waiting for ten years.

137
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,960
Rumei.

138
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,900
Chang'an.

139
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,800
I did like you before.

140
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,800
But that was ten years ago.

141
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Now, everything has changed.

142
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,300
I came back to change my residency.

143
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,400
I'm getting married.

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,200
That year, I left without saying goodbye,

145
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,500
because I didn't want to affect your mood before the game.

146
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,200
I wasn't able to find the opportunity to say it.

147
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
When you walk in,

148
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,750
please listen carefully.

149
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,600
The shaking leaves are the passion of me waiting for you.

150
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
But when you leave,

151
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,500
they fall behind you.

152
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,800
My friend, they are not flowers.

153
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,300
It is my withered heart.

154
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,430
Senior brother, have some water.

155
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Mr. Xie,

156
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,000
we're not going to air this episode.

157
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,000
People should keep their promises.

158
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Since I agreed to go on the show,

159
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,400
then there's no reason for people to work in vain because of me.

160
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,410
No matter what the ending is.

161
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,600
Sister Cheng Liao,

162
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,200
I suddenly feel like I've done something wrong.

163
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,000
I should've waited for the game to be over,

164
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,400
then help Senior Brother with his confession.

165
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,200
Actually,

166
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,000
I think with how smart Senior brother is,

167
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,600
he can feel it.

168
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,800
Or else, he wouldn't be looking for the restaurant himself before the semi-final

169
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,400
or tell you about his past.

170
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,000
He wouldn't allow us to interfere and help him with his wish.

171
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,200
You are saying that Senior Brother knew Sister Rumei was getting married from the start?

172
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,600
That's not what I meant.

173
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,900
I was trying to say that

174
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,500
when two people are together,

175
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,800
they can feel how much the other person loves or invests.

176
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,000
But because the times they are together are very happy,

177
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
they would choose to ignore all the signs.

178
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,600
However, they would still feel insecure.

179
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Maybe Senior Brother felt insecure

180
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,400
so he wanted to try with all he had.

181
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,300
But he must be sad after confessing and getting rejected.

182
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,700
Even if he got rejected, he expressed his feeling to her.

183
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,800
It's better than regretting it.

184
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,800
The China-Korea GO Invitational semi-finals is now over.

185
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Even though during the game between Xie Chang'an 3-dan and Xie Hanzhou 9-dan,

186
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Xie Chang'an has been crying, which was unexpected,

187
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
but the result was as expected.

188
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,200
Senior Brother, even if I lost to you again,

189
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I didn't run away this time. I tried my very best.

190
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,800
The final result will be

191
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,000
decided by the game played by Xie Hanzhou 9-dan and Sheng Jingchu 9-dan.

192
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
This game between the teacher and his student has been anticipated

193
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
since GO Legends of China Competition.

194
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,100
And this will be Master Xie Hanzhou's last game in his GO career.

195
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,640
Panda, is Senior Brother okay?

196
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,700
He was crying so hard.

197
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,250
He was dehydrated.

198
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Master and Xihe carried him back right after the game.

199
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,500
What a romantic.

200
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,200
He might not be the best GO player,

201
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,600
but he is definitely the most romantic one.

202
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
That's not necessarily true.

203
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,150
There's still me.

204
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,300
I...

205
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,800
don't have to wait for you.

206
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,600
I'll never let you go.

207
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,900
Panda, I didn't expect that

208
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,800
Master Xie was going to announce his retirement after the game.

209
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,200
He prepared for it.

210
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,400
Are you prepared for the game against Master?

211
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,200
I know Master's strategies.

212
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,400
I don't doubt his ability.

213
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Master and I have been playing since I was a kid.

214
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,100
We understand each other very well.

215
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,670
But when it comes to preparation,

216
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,200
I have no idea how.

217
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm talking about

218
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,600
are you ready right here?

219
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,210
This part...

220
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,600
is never going to be fully prepared.

221
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,700
Actually, ever since the GO Legends of China Competition,

222
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,080
I haven't seriously thought about

223
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,000
what I would be like

224
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,800
if it were Master

225
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,600
sitting across from me.

226
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,700
Because every time I thought about it, I would get very bothered.

227
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,700
Everyone has emotions and they get bothered by things.

228
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't be too hard on yourself.

229
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
Also, didn't you let go of winning or losing already?

230
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
Just go with your heart

231
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,800
and do what you think is right.

232
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,590

[China-Korea GO Invitational]

234
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
Jingchu,

235
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm finally playing against you in a game.

236
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,800
Master.

237
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,400
After a few days of rest, the first round of the final game of the China-Korea GO Invitational,

238
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,900
Xie Hanzhou 9-dan verses Sheng Jingchu 9-dan

239
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,800
begins now.

240
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Please make your guesses.

241
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,400
Sister Cheng Liao, are you okay?

242
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,240
I think Panda doesn't look right.

243
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,600
Other than taking longer to think,

244
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
I don't see anything wrong.

245
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,300
Little Sister-in-Law, it happens in situations like this.

246
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,800
He's playing against his Master after all, am I right?

247
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,700
Don't worry so much.

248
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,200
The rule of the game is best two out of three. Jingchu is only trying to be stable.

249
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,800
It's normal for him to take longer to think.

250
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,400
I don't think it's the problem with taking longer to think.

251
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,800
What is it then?

252
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,300
I can't describe it either. He just doesn't look normal.

253
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,300
Jingchu, are you feeling sick?

254
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,000
You are burning up and you are still trying to toughen up.

255
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,600
Let's go.

256
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,000
Take the meds.

257
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,650
It helps faster recovery.

[Honorable Credential]

259
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,050
During the China-Korea GO Invitational Tournament,

260
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,030
recently, the Korean master, Cho Shen Woo at 9-dan

261
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,530
was defeated by Sheng Jingchu at 9-dan.

262
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,600
Brother, look. No matter how great Sheng Jingchu is he wouldn't dare win against Xie Hanzhou.

263
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,660
You say, did he lose on purpose?
During the first match, he looked absented minded the whole time. It looks like he purposely retained his strength.

264
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Xiao Pu,

265
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:00,200
do you know what it means, if they are suspecting that Sheng Jingchu is purposely trying to throw the game?

266
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,700
It means...

267
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,520
that losing to Xie Hanzhou isn't something that should be taken as expected.

268
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,370
With his skills,

269
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,920
he could already be talked about at the same level as his once unattainable master.

270
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:29,480
Or even surpass him. His skills have reached a point that even I can't reach.

271
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,030
If he really wins against Master,

272
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,750
then with how I am now,

273
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,500
it's too unattainable.

274
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,300
Brother.

275
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,680
Cheng Liao and Yuan Bao are really compatible.

276
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,380
Sheng Jingchu must be really happy to have a girlfriend like you.

277
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,000

 (TN: The video have comments that fly across the screen as the video plays.)

279
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,920
- If you look closely...
- Stop reading them.

280
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,860
Cheng Liao is really cute

281
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,990
and really pleasant to look at.

282
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,430

283
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,990
Give it to me. Give it.

284
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,110
You're becoming more and more troublesome.

285
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,360
I saw that they are praising you, so I'm happy.

286
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,930
If you're happy then I can be relieved.

287
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,170
Today at the competition, you were looking strange.

288
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,700
It didn't look like you were nervous. You were just blankly sitting there.

289
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,000
It was like your soul was already floating up to outer space.

290
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,020
You're still the one that knows me best.

291
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,020
You really floated off to outer space?

292
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,860
It wasn't outer space but the past.

293
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,380
Since I was a child, Master has taken care of me.

294
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,930
This time, it's his last professional game.

295
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,610
Every time I think about it,

296
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,270
my heart feels distressed and sad.

297
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,450
As I sit across from Master, face to face with him,

298
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,570
I don't know if we're playing a game or saying goodbye.

299
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,400
Panda, actually,

300
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,890
no matter how bright and glorious the past was,

301
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:56,190
there's always a day that comes to say goodbye.

302
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,130
I just feel reluctant to part.

303
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,450
Even if it were not with you, Master would still retire.

304
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,200
There would still be a day he would retire from this profession.

305
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,910
Moreover, I can't say for sure

306
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,600
at his career's final professional peak

307
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,590
to encounter the student he taught himself,

308
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,800
to him, it is also a type of happiness.

309
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,810
Perhaps.

310
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,890
So, your burden doesn't have to be so heavy.

311
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,140
You don't have to see it as a farewell game. Just perform your best.

312
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,370
No matter the results, play it as

313
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,210
a present to Master.

314
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,980
Don't think too much and play your best tomorrow.

315
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,700
Okay.

316
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,490

319
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,470
Master, why is this Korean dude here?

320
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,150
Can you be quiet? Sheng Jingchu is already tired from competing.

321
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,330
Why do you care? This is my master. Yes, you.

322
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,490
You're the one that keeps staying here and affecting his training and sleep. No wonder his condition was so bad today.

323
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,030
My bad, but that can't be true.

324
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,840
Because I already moved out before the competition.

325
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,660
What?

326
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,530
Master, it's already been this long

327
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,450
and I haven't even stayed here before.

328
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,150
What are you trying to do to me?

329
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,380
Your master hasn't even eaten yet.

330
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,930
Can you both properly eat?

331
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,100
Do you really not want to eat any?

332
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,310
I already ate. My girlfriend made me a fish soup full of love.

333
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,500
Really.

334
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,930
You're showing off your love all time.

335
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,360
However, this soup,

336
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,380
I worked really hard on it, just for you.

337
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,670
Here, Sheng Jingchu.

338
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,610
I'm not drinking it for your own good.

339
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,340
You've forgotten about last time, the incident where you suffered from starving.

340
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,340
Okay, our amateur player.

341
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,170
Here, try this.

342
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,080
That's right.

343
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,380
But I should say,

344
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,840
your cooking skill is pretty good.

345
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,930
However, compared to Sister Cheng Liao it still falls short.

346
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,760
Of course, I'm not a professional chef.

347
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,470
To be honest, you're not here to cheer on your master.

348
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,230
You're here to freeload a meal. You've been constantly eating.

349
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,910
Don't speak nonsense.

350
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,380
Master,

351
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,440
we've known each other

352
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,550
not too long, but it hasn't been short either.

353
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,930
Except for teaching me GO, you haven't taught me anything else.

354
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,450
So, the stuff about Jiuzhou Hall

355
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,980
and Grandmaster, I don't know very much.

356
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,190
So I can't really help you or solve anything for you.

357
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,900
However, I'm here today to tell you,

358
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,150
your disciple will always believe in you and be here to support you.

359
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,950
I want to transfer to you all my energy.

360
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,570
I also believe in you.

361
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,100
I'll support you and I will pass on my energy to you.

362
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,120
What are you also doing?

363
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,730
I'm being serious.

364
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,620
Sheng Jingchu,

365
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:19,080
do you know for this competition why I must stay here?

366
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,010
Isn't it so you can play GO with me?

367
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,120
Yes and no.

368
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,920
In this invitational tournament, Master Cho Shen Woo made a rare appearance to participate.

369
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,640
To someone like me, who has been trying to defeat my master,

370
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,040
this was a very rare opportunity.

371
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,530
Actually, staying here with you is so I wouldn't have to run into my master as much.

372
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,010
So I could gather some courage.

373
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,850
Unfortunately, both of us have lost.

374
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,950
Sheng, I really envy you.

375
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,830
I envy that you have the courage at the international game

376
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,170
to play against your own master fair and square.

377
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,450
So the courage that I have gathered,

378
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,360
I will pass that on to you. Hopefully, during the game, you will be able to find yourself.

379
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,630
I didn't expect that you were also a decent person with a dream.

380
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,710
Looks like I've made a wrong assumption about you.

381
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,170
Wait a minute. Did you mean I wasn't a decent person?

382
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,830
At least maybe just a little bit.

383
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,410
Thank you.

384
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,890
Cheers.

385
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,330
[Sheng Jingchu - 9 dan]
[Xie Hanzhou - 9 dan]

386
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,590
Master,

387
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,890
if you wanted to see me, just tell me and I would have come to visit you instead.

388
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,160
Why did you come here?

389
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,440
I've heard everyone say that Cheng Liao made your little garden really beautiful.

390
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,520
So I came over to see it.

391
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:42,100
That... Wasn't Jo Yeon Hoon staying with you? Where is he?

392
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,900
He's hiding somewhere outside.

393
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,030
Jingchu, your first GO round

394
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,260
startled me and it also made me angry.

395
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,600
Master, you're exaggerating.

396
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,670
Exaggerating?

397
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,470
I saw it right away.

398
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,440
During the first round,

399
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,420
you weren't even focusing.

400
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,800
What were you doing? Did you think about your childhood again?

401
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,720
Master, as expected, I can't seem to hide anything from you.

402
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,250
The second round? It was much better.

403
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,600
You were finally able to focus more.

404
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,870
However, it was still not at your best condition.

405
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,260
I'll tell you.

406
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,660
Right now, we're tied, one on one.

407
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,240
If you're distracted again,

408
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,620
you won't be able to win against this old man. All right?

409
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,050
Master, actually, I...

410
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:52,820
Jingchu, this last round you don't have to have any worries.

411
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,650
You've already found your path in life.

412
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,080
You also found your own GO style.

413
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,920
Master is only just another opponent.

414
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,140
As a child, I have taught you

415
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,930
to put all your efforts forward...

416
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,820
is the biggest respect you give to your opponents.

417
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,370
Do you still remember this?

418
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,390
Everyone the highly anticipated China-Korea GO Invitational tournament,

419
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,070
is at the last round. It is Xie Hanzhou 9 dan

420
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,850
against Sheng Jingchu 9 dan. This Master-Student game is a tiebreaker game.

421
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,030
It is now officially starting.

422
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,080
That year, you were just a little boy.

423
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,450
You never learned GO before, not even a day.

424
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,200
Yet surprisingly, you were able to fully recover from a disorganized game.

425
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,810
At that time, I said

426
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:50,000
I must bring this genius back to Jiuzhou Hall.

427
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,150
- I know. You were arguing with Teacher Jiang Chunlai at the time.
- Right.

428
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:00,330
That year, I made the decision for you to learn GO.

429
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,990
That changed your life.

430
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,840
Today's match layout by both players is very interesting.

431
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,960
We expected Master Xie to use Sanrensei, a move he excels at, to carry on a big game.

432
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,240
Who knew that white later caught up.

433
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,780
Black is also not struggling or fighting but conveniently changing directions to an open area.

434
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,600
This has maintained the balance of the game. Perhaps, Master Xie intends to make a distracting move.

435
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,610
Master, you and GO have taught me a lot.

436
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,700
If it weren't for you, then I wouldn't be here today.

437
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,910
Do you remember this problem?

438
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,970
Of course, I do.

439
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,450
This was the only life and death problem back then

440
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,440
that I couldn't solve, no matter how hard I tried.

441
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,230
Yes, back then in order to solve this problem, you didn't sleep and intensely studied it.

442
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,730
Later, any difficult problem you came across, no longer posed any difficulty to you.

443
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,760
This white play has considered the game's overall situation and has abandoned the lower board.

444
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,230
Conveniently, he turned the center into an open area.

445
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,950
What a good move to let up on the lesser territory for the bigger!

446
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,320
One move in this complicated situation turned this into a winning game.

447
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,380
Jingchu,

448
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,570
sometimes I think about

449
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,370
with your natural talent and intelligence, you'll succeed in anything you do.

450
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:35,250
However, I bind you at Jiuzhou Hall and into the game of GO.

451
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,720
Master, don't say that.

452
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,740
So I thought,

453
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,730
you may have another way of living.

454
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,420
Maybe you'll be like the other kids. More energetic. More cheerful.

455
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,360
Maybe you would have secretly fallen in love with a girl.

456
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,040
Then would have started dating a lot earlier.

457
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,180
Master, to be honest with you,

458
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,420
I have really thought about it like that.

459
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,120
When I first met Liao Liao,

460
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,240
I just thought if I could have gone to an ordinary elementary school.

461
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,470
An ordinary middle school and coincidentally,

462
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,360
in the same class as Liao Liao.

463
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,030
After school, we could go to the street cart across from the school and have a snack.

464
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:29,300
Then we can think about the math and English problems together.

465
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,570
But, Master, though there have been many choices I could make while growing up,

466
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,840
my favorite has always been sitting in front of a GO board.

467
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,080
Right now, does white choose to firmly stick here or approach closer to these two pieces?

468
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,710
Sheng Jingchu chosen a firm move.

469
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,520
From the current game condition, it still looks optimistic.

470
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,190
Master,

471
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:31,190
I love you and I also love GO.

472
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,990
The decision to become a professional GO player

473
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,610
has been my own decision.

474
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:43,120
No matter how difficult the road will be or how long the road is,

475
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,550
Jiuzhou Hall will always be my home.

476
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,240
It will always be a place I'll return to.

477
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,180
Right now, there are only one or two end-game pieces left.

478
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,520
Looks like both evidently, know who the winner of the game is.

479
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,970
Then, let us wait for the final result together.

480
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,110
This game has been an exceptionally rare good game.

481
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,370
Both have played neatly and efficiently, easily, and skillfully.

482
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,900
However, it is still Sheng Jingchu 9 dan

483
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,030
who has surpassed his master. We can only say it's too bad,

484
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,010
but the defeat is glorious.

485
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,160
Hey, look!

486
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,000
I still managed to let you steal and exchange in front of me so fearlessly.

487
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,520
Jingchu, no matter when, don't forget

488
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,330
the reason you play GO.

489
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:58,770
This perhaps is the last thing that I can teach you.

490
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,910
I played a whole life of GO

491
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,930
and having a disciple like you

492
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,120
is my greatest achievement.

493
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:14,060
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

494
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,020
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

495
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,620
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

496
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,380
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

497
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,400
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

498
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,350
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

499
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:38,720
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

500
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,810
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

501
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:48,710
♫ Warmed my rainy nights,
called out and made me see ♫

502
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:54,000
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

503
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,970
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

504
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:10,480
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

505
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:35,450
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

506
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,370
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

507
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:43,980
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

508
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,960
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

509
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,830
♫ There is color all around you ♫

510
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:59,200
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

511
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,830
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

512
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:18,190
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

513
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,250
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

514
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:28,210
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

515
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:34,100
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

516
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,130
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

517
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:44,010
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

518
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:49,450
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

519
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,990
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

520
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:08,640
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
