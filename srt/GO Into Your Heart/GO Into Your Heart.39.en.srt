Senior brother, Yuda,

I see you two are tired. Go home. I'll take care of Master.

Okay.

Jingchu, do you still remember when you were a kid?

31
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,710
Did I use to ride the bike and take you to the park?

32
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,960
- I remember.
- I asked you to draw a picture.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,960
I was doing this to know if you can tell the difference between colors.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,400
And you used green to paint the sky,

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,870
and used purple to paint the grass.

36
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,770
I saw you crying in front of the drawing board

37
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,580
and it made me feel so bad.

38
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,100
Since then, I have taken extra care of you.

39
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,390

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,160
you will hand Jiuzhou Hall to Sheng Jingchu?

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,510
to me, right?

Xiao Lan, Master has always been lucky.

It's just a minor illness. He will be fine.

Master will be fine.

89
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,130
When I was in the hospital, I was just too worried.

90
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,550
I didn't really hear what Master said.

91
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,060
Did he say anything about leaving Jiuzhou Hall

92
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,040
to me?

93
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,800
Yes.

94
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,740
However, I think he was talking about Senior Brother Jing.

95
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm curious. Senior Brother Yao Ke hasn't been here for long.

96
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,680
Why would Master say such a thing?

97
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,200
If Master didn't hold my hand and say that

98
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,470
he's leaving the dojo to me,

99
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,190
I would never believe it either.

100

But given the situation,

101
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,730
I didn't want him to talk more, so...

102
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,740
Anyways, just have Master rest and recover.

103
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,640
We'll see after Master is recovered.

I tried to remember when I came back.

The reason for Master not giving the dojo to Senior Brother Jingchu

106
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,240
was probably because of something else.

165
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,000
to talk to, Old Xie?

166
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,010
My Old Xie...

167
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,250
Take care of yourself.

168
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,160
Xihe.

169
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,230
Senior Brother.

170
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,520
Go check why Jingchu is not here yet.

171
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,370
Okay. Don't worry. I will go check on him.

172
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,570
Panda!

173
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,150
[Xihe]

174
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,520
Hello, Xihe.

175
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,790
Cheng Liao.

176
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,660
Where is Senior Brother Jing? Why isn't he here yet?

177
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,960
I don't know either. He's not home.

178
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,280
I shouldn't have left him this morning.

179
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,880
I'll call you back later. I'm going to look for him.

180
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,510
Where is Sheng Jingchu?

181
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,940
That's right. Where is he?

182
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:44,670
Xie Chang'an, I have a question for you. Why isn't Master Xie's favorite disciple, Sheng Jingchu, not here?

183
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,180
Are there any stories behind it?

184
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,790
Or would you say that before Master Xie Hanzhou passed,

185
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,030
they had conflicts?

186
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,970
Mr. Xie Chang'an, we are only curious about Sheng Jingchu...

187
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,040
Shut up, all of you!

188
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,060
What are you doing here?

189
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,960
We are journalists. We are here to ask questions.

190
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,820
- We...
- Why are you hitting him?

191
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,090
We are here to say goodbye to my father.

192
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,650
Are you guys still human? Where are your morals?

193
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,230
We are only asking questions.

194
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,750
Get out!

195
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,420
What are you guys doing here? What's your problem?

196
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,720
- We are only asking a few questions.
- Get out. Now.

197
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,490
Get out of here. I don't care which company you work for. Get out.

198
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,000
Stop filming. Stop.

199
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,540
Let's not wait for Jingchu. We shall begin.

200
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,270
Senior Brother.

201
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,870
Dad.

202
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,430
I'm not ready to send you off.

203
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,600
I didn't expect this day to come so soon.

204
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm not even ready to say farewell.

205
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,040
Master.

206
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,400
We all aren't ready for it.

207
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,190
You taught us how to play.

208
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,700
From how to hold a stone,

209
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,950
you taught us hand in hand.

210
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,920
Master, don't worry.

211
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,530
We will pass down the GO legend.

212
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,040
We will do our best

213
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,830
to teach all the kids in our dojo.

214
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,560
Just like how you used to teach us.

215
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,920
Dad,

216
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,920
let us play with you for one last time.

217
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,950
Old Xie.

218
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,470
This is the last move

219
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,360
for us old men.

220
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,820
[Jiu]
(Nine)

221
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,250
Jingchu, come here. Jingchu.

222
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,510
Uncle Wang has trapped me.

223
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,670
Come take a look and teach me what to do.

224
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,020
Come here, young man.

225
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,650
Come here.

226
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,180
Stupid kid!

227
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,270
If it wasn't for him, I couldn't win!

228
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,440
Jingchu, you've been staring at it without saying anything.

229
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Do my black stones still get any chance?

230
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,890
This kid... What is he...

231
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,030
Panda.

232
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,980
Liao Liao...

233
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,210
I can't play anymore.

234
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:23,190
Let's... not think about playing for now.

235
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,670
My parents left me behind

236
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,540
when I was six.

237
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,290
And now Master is gone too.

238
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,500
I don't have parents

239
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,200
and now I don't have a master.

240
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,420
Panda,

241
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,580
you still have me.

242
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,550
I'm still here.

243
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,420
Eat something.

244
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,930
Hello, Senior Brother.

245
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,670
We're at Jingchu's childhood home.

246
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,590
The one he used to live in when he was a kid.

247
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,860
He's not doing so well right now.

248
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,950
Don't come looking for him for now.

249
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,710
He's just too sad,

250
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,950
so he didn't go to Master's funeral.

251
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,660
He's not eating or drinking,

252
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,640
and doesn't respond when I talk to him.

253
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,070
I'm afraid that he's going to collapse.

254
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,920
Cheng Liao,

255
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,110
please take care of Jingchu.

256
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,660
Don't worry.

257
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,120
I will take good care of him.

258
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,720
Okay.

259
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,120
Panda,

260
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,920
if you do this,

261
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,070
your body can't take much of this.

262
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,510
I'm here for you.

263
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,710
I decided to say my goodbyes to GO today.

264
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,850
Hello, Sister Cheng Liao.

265
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,190
How is Senior Brother Jing?

266
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,010
Xiao Lan,

267
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,520
Jingchu just said

268
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,670
he doesn't want to play GO

269
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,000
or compete anymore.

270
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,850
What? He's not going to play anymore?

271
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,880
Senior Brother, we need to go talk to Senior Brother Jing.

272
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,430
He can't be this impulsive.

273
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,640
Senior Brother?

274
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,400
Senior Brother, say something!

275
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,650
You are our backbone right now!

276
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,160
In my opinion, the decision Senior Brother Jingchu made

277
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,620
is not just impulsive. We are not him.

278
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,280
We don't know the true reason for him doing this.

279
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,410
Instead of trying to stop him,

280
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,940
why not give him some time to think and calm down?

281
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,590
What we should do is to try and understand him more.

282
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,450
Understand what?

283
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,610
Why are you yelling?

284
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,380
GO is everything to Master.

285
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,780
Giving up GO is giving up everything to him.

286
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,920
- You must be crazy to let us sit and watch!
- Jiang Yuda.

287
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,860
- Why are you being so rude?
- I am rude!

288
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,850
I'm not fighting with you all.

289
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,130
Senior Brother.

290
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,360
Master.

291
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,450
Master,

292
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,110
we have been worrying about you.

293
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:49,640
I know you are sad because of Senior Master.

294
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,880
But you can't keep doing this.

295
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,110
Your body will collapse. Besides,

296
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,100
no matter how sad you are,

297
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,860
you can't give up on playing GO.

298
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,800
Senior Brother Jing,

299
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,970
we are all sad about Master.

300
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,870
But you need to play harder when you are sad.

301
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,900
That's the best way to repay Master.

302
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,910
Senior Brother, it's normal to say crazy things when you are feeling sad.

303
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,620
But if you give up now,

304
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,210
you will regret it when you're calm.

305
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:36,810
We can't be too extreme when we make decisions. Take a few days to rest first.

306
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,470
Is that okay?

307
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,140
I really don't know what I should do now.

308
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,720
He loves GO so much

309
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,260
and he just found his path and position in GO.

310
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,750
When he told me he doesn't want to play anymore, I was so shocked that my brain just blanked out.

311
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,080
I can't watch him turning into a zombie.

312
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,410
But I...

313
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,760
I really don't know how to comfort him either.

314
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,610
I don't have to say more about

315
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,680
Jingchu's personality.

316
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,560
Maybe only one person can talk him out of it.

317
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,330
Just eat something.

318
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,580
Panda,

319
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,750
when you told me

320
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,270
you don't want to play anymore,

321
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,990
I was so scared.

322
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,270
I'm scared for you...

323
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,290
There's no need to stop me.

324
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,570
I'm not trying to stop you.

325
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,130
It's your choice.

326
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,850
It's okay if you quit.

327
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,880
No matter what,

328
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,720
I'll always be here for you.

329
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,110
But...

330
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:36,100
you can't keep starving yourself and stay here.

331
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,990
Your body can't bear this.

332
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,080
Panda,

333
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,720
if you collapse,

334
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,910
what do I do?

335
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,690
Panda,

336
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,950
take a walk with me tomorrow.

337
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,510
Just do it...

338
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,640
to help me relax.

339
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,240
Is that okay?

340
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,790
Okay.

341
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,690
Panda,

342
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,570
I'm a little tired. There's a nice restaurant somewhere close by.

343
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,860
Let's go sit there for a bit.

344
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,770
This way, please.

345
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,370
I'm going to the restroom. You go ahead.

346
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,760
This way, sir.

347
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,670
I'm sorry, wrong table.

348
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,240
Stop.

349
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,070
Sit here and watch.

350
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,800
Master Ye, what are you doing here?

351
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,450
Don't leave.

352
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,260
I heard that you are retiring.

353
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:16,190
Who taught you to run away from your problems? Did Xie Hanzhou teach you that?

354
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:43,790
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

355
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,800
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

356
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,290
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

357
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,090
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

358
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,110
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

359
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,010
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

360
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,520
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

361
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,630
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

362
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:18,470
♫ Warmed my rainy nights,
called out and made me see ♫

363
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:24,540
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

364
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,640
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

365
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:43,790
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

366
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:05,160
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

367
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,260
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

368
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,720
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

369
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,480
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

370
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,580
♫ There is color all around you ♫

371
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,440
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

372
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,680
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

373
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,200
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

374
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:47,860
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

375
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,040
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

376
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:57,910
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

377
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:03,780
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

378
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,950
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

379
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:13,740
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

380
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:19,860
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

381
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,620
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

382
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:38,910
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
