Try this. See if this is the taste in your memory.

How is it? Does it taste the same?

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,990
I don't want to lie to you.

23
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,840
So it is still missing something.

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,150
Honestly, every time I taste fish soup,

25
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,630
it tastes different from the one my mom made when I was young.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,600
It just missed something.

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,360
In the end,

28
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,690
I don't know if it is the fish soup that's missing something

29
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,670
or I lost part of my memory.

30
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,760
Your memory is excellent. I'm sure it is my problem.

31
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,960
This is my first attempt, lack of experience.

32
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,110
Let me try a couple more times; I will succeed one day.

33
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,400
Can you come and walk with me?

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,700
After having your fish soup, I already feel more energized.

35
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,980
I don't recall adding any special ingredient.

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,200
Is it because you were so focused on cooking for me,

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,090
you haven't eaten anything?

38
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,320
Cooking is like that. When you see someone enjoying your food,

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,530
your stomach is also feeling satisfied.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,100
All these foods, can it be good?

41
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,490
Is it really that good?

42
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,890
I call them, "The taste of happiness."

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,260
Don't tell me this is your first time!

44
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,660
I seldom eat out.

45
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,650
You have to try this. It's really good.

46
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,080
What do you think?

47
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,250
When I was in high school,

48
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,280
there were food stalls on the entire street outside the campus.

49
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,210
So every day after school,

50
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,520
I ate while walking home.

51
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,390
By the time I got home, I was full.

52
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,110
Later when I went to college

53
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,870
and came home for vacation, all those food stalls were gone.

54
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,230
I was devastated.

55
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,110
In fact, it is just like you can't forget the taste of that fish soup.

56
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,010
What I missed the most is the taste from those food stalls.

57
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,000
I call them "After School Taste."

58
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,270
I have never been to school.

59
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,620
I was sent to Jiuzhou Hall when I was six.

60
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,200
There were special home-school teachers.

61
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,390
We would spend half of the day studying, another half-day practicing GO.

62
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,010
They would change the teachers all the time,

63
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,240
except for the GO teacher.

64
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,500
So were you distressed by your match with Master Xie?

65
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,520
If I said,

66
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,120
one thing was intellectually contrary to principle

67
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,880
and your emotions were correct,

68
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,430
what would you do?

69
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,390
But human reason and emotions are inherently difficult to separate.

70
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:49,290
It's like how people know tasty food isn't necessarily healthy,

71
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,530
and healthy food doesn't necessarily taste good.

72
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,740
Just like my sister, she tried to brainwash me

73
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,480
every day about the benefits of quitting sugar.

74
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,150
But sugar really makes people happy.

75
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,040
So my conclusion is to...

76
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,640
follow your heart.

77
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,580

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,400
Little Yi, want to drink with your dad?

162
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,260
Of course!

163
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,570
Hey, photographer!

164
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,990
Don't you want to have a drink to celebrate?

165
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,680
What is there to celebrate?

166
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,520
The scandal has been cleared. Congratulations! You successfully turned from an internet celebrity into a nobody overnight.

167
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,430
What is there to celebrate about being a nobody?

168
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,470
Look at her face, she just doesn't want to admit it.

169
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,400
Tell me. Do you like Sheng Jingchu?

170
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,280
I don't like Sheng Jingchu. We are just friends!

171
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,010
That's it! That line! He said it so naturally.

172
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
We are friends.

173
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,750
I can't stand your middle-aged man cheesiness!

174
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,330
Of course, I'm not as handsome as Sheng Jingchu.

175
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,320
This is what I'm trying to say.

176
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,460
He's handsome and famous.

177
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,860
Wouldn't it be great to date him?

178
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,110
Say that again?

179
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm just shaking up the atmosphere here.

180
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,290
Exactly, Dad was just kidding.

181
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,750
The joke is on me anyways.

182
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,470
I was joking, too.

183
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,280
I am really joking. Wasn't my acting good?

184
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,020
See. She's not angry.

185
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,610
How about this? Let me set you guys up.

186
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,490
I have no objection.

187
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,030
Can you two just shut up? I'm going to get alcohol

188
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,440
to block your mouths. I'll make you two so drunk!

189
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,940
Let's get her drunk.

190
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,270
Let's do that!

191
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,960
[The most handsome Xu Chi/ Hi, Mr. Xu ordered...]

192
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,350
Why do you separate them again?

193
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,900
It doesn't taste good that way. Look.

194
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,710
You have to eat it like this.

195
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,000
[Nie Sheng]

196
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,600
- Master.
-Take it.

197
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,670
Jingchu,

198
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,020
that wine is a gift from Master Nie.

199
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,240
Give it a try.

200
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,740
Master,

201
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,160
I don't normally drink.

202
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,190
You still don't drink?

203
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,720
That's no fun at all. You should learn.

204
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
It's okay, just leave it here.

205
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,760
Whenever I come here, we will have it together.

206
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,010
Jingchu, you have been living at this house for so long,

207
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,450
it's the same every time;

208
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,650
so lifeless.

209
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,620
It's only on the GO board

210
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,870
that you show some life.

211
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,620
When am I going to meet Miss Cheng?

212
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,130
Master, we are just friends.

213
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,890
Master,

214
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,020
are you really sick?

215
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,810
Did you think I was lying?

216
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,780
It's normal to be sick at my age.

217
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,280
- You recovered pretty fast.
- It's because my body is in top shape.

218
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,990
Why are you eyeing me?

219
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,530
You don't believe me?

220
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,940
Remember what I taught you?

221
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,170
You need to respect the competition, respect your opponent.

222
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,840
That's what I taught you. Do you think I would make that mistake?

223
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,690
You little brat now have the nerve to

224
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,390
question my decision.

225
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,890
You better never mention this again

226
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,310
or I will be very mad.

227
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,490
You missed another chance at the Legends of China competition finals,

228
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,670
and missed the chance to win the Grand Slam. As long as you don't regret it, it's fine.

229
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,830
There's nothing for me to regret.

230
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,330
For a professional GO player, do you know what the saddest thing is?

231
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,900
The saddest thing is

232
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,760
not having a matching rival.

233
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,040
In the past few years, there was Master Jiang

234
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,520
competing with me side by side.

235
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,790
He wins some, he loses some. It was fun.

236
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,490
But now, his condition has gone down.

237
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,250
He rarely participates in any GO tournament.

238
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,320
When I meet someone who has a similar status,

239
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,460
that will be when you are back in top-notch shape.

240
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,060
Actually, when I was in Suzhou,

241
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,230
my condition was pretty good.

242
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,590
I'm glad you have confidence in yourself.

243
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,230
I saw from the file that both Masters, Xie Hanzhou and Jiang Chunlai, both wanted to accept you as disciple.

244
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,290
Master Jiang also often said that he and Master Xie together discovered you.

245
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,570
Clearly, I filmed all the videos of Sheng Jingchu.

246
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,800
She edited herself into it, so it became her interview.

247
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,260
She found a man to pretend to be Sheng Jingchu to be in the same frame.

248
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,280
The program's click rate is high.

249
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,140
The company will know your contribution.

250
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,360
Mr. Sheng, I heard about your childhood story.

251
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,130
I feel very touched. I'm sure your story

252
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,530
will move all the viewers' hearts.

253
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,790
Are you sure this person is conducting a program

254
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,500
instead of seducing Jingchu?

255
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,820
Isn't that what I'm talking about? Her clothes were...

256
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,890
Even I was too embarrassed to watch.

257
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,790
When I was in Suzhou, I captured her alive.

258
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,990
Think about it. At that time, Senior Brother Jing was filmed by Cheng Liao.

259
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,900
But all of a sudden she became the one interviewing Senior Brother Jing.

260
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,840
Isn't it disgusting or not?

261
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,570
This is how it is in life sometimes.

262
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,960
Sometimes you see the scenery.

263
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,290
But when you turn around, the world seems to have changed.

264
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,560
What are you talking about?

265
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,570
Perhaps you are not turning your head,

266
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,590
until one day,

267
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,440
when you see a mountain that isn't a mountain and see the sea that isn't the sea,

268
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,290
you will then comprehend the changes among the tens of thousands of living things in the world.

269
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,360
Speak human words.

270
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,900
I think Senior Sister-in-Law filmed Senior Brother Jing, but later this woman edited herself into the video.

271
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,000
She made it look like she did the whole thing. Get it?

272
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,850
I originally disliked that little editor Cheng Liao.

273
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,170
But now I think she's quite pitiful.

274
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,970
Come, Xihe.

275
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,610
Please speak, Senior Brother.

276
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,650
Put away your magic tricks. Even Sun Wukong has only 72 transformations.
 (T/N: Sun Wukong is the Monkey King in Journey to the West.)

277
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,150
But you are changing every few days. I think you...

278
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,440
must find it tiring.

279
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,840
How about it? Does it give off a good effect?

280
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,410
I think Xiao Lan likes intellectual guys.

281
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,240
See? Her attitude toward me was quite good today.

282
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,160
If you think that was a good attitude,

283
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,610
I really don't know how to console you anymore. But I am curious about one thing.

284
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,140
How long do you plan to keep acting like this?

285
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,350
Until she likes me.

286
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,170
Isn't that too persistent?

287
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,560
Perhaps I am only a moth in your eyes.

288
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,490
We won't swat the moth. Just force landing.

289
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,240
I have a shallow stomach. Besides,

290
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,740
Xiao Lan has already left. Who are you acting for?

291
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,210
Work tortures me hundreds of thousand times.

292
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,030
I treat work as if it were my first love.

293
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,200
My first love hasn't even begun. It can't be so frustrating.

294
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Cheng Liao, how is it?

295
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,260
Does the show look good?

296
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,750
Other than the portion of Sheng Jingchu,

297
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,430
the rest... isn't that good.

298
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,000
It's not up to you whether the show is good or not. It's up to the numbers.

299
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,100
You shouldn't fake it to get the numbers either.

300
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,550
Clearly, I filmed the parts with Sheng Jingchu. You are plagiarizing.

301
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,160
You are doing infighting?

302
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,840
What? Are you going to complain about me?

303
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,550
Didn't I put your name in the credits?

304
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,000
You're temporarily on probation.

305
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,310
Why are you so dissatisfied?

306
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,780
You guys have no office etiquette.

307
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,880
Why are you screaming and kicking in the office?

308
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,260
Director, have you seen the interview?

309
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,250
The original wasn't like that, I think you should—

310
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,740
I don't care what you think, as long as I like it.

311
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,500
Everyone, go gather at the lobby.

312
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,630
Hurry up! Move!

313
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,300
Keep it up! Be energized!

314
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,750
Show your smiles, everyone.

315
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,650
Ready, go!

316
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,710
Brother Yu Chi?

317
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,730
I'd like to formally introduce to everyone.

318
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,120
He is the new Vice President of the Programming Department at Pinecone Video,

319
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,540
Xu Chi, Vice President Xu! Welcome him!

320
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,110
Welcome!

Little Zhiliao, you didn't expect me, did you?

322
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,350
What is going on with Sheng Jingchu's exclusive interview?

323
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,650
Sheng Jingchu?

324
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,840
You saw it?

325
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,220
It's a small achievement.

326
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,550
Nothing to brag about.

327
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,350
In Sheng Jingchu's video display and Lisa's video display, the lights clearly don't match.

328
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,170
They clearly weren't filmed together.

329
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,330
There were many problems with the editing, too.

330
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,940
Do you think others can't notice, so I can't notice either?

331
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,070
Of course. You are who you are.

332
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,400
I think none of that is important.

333
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,030
I think the most important is the viewing result.

334
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,340
No one will mind it. Besides, I—

What do you mean you think?

336
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,370
I don't want any of you to think.

337
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,330
I want to see the basic professional standards and attitude as you do your job in this field.

338
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,630
In my team, if anyone cheats or falsely reports,

339
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,520
that person will leave.

00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,560
Right away.

343

Don't leave when you get off work. We'll eat dinner together.

Why are you all just standing there?

345
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Team Leaders and those above that level, follow me to the meeting.

Is that for real?

Is this Vice President Xu your sweetheart?

349
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,450
Look at you. He must be the one.

350
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,660
You're good. As soon as he starts,

351
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,990
he strikes down Auntie Liu. So handsome!

I think we are flying.

We'll be walking tall in the company from now on.

354

Legs, take me with you when you fly.

355

Legs! Long legs!

356

Legs, walk slowly!

Come down. Don't be scared.

Lisa plagiarized her materials.

I already ordered the programming department to take the copied video down and redo it

to return the video to its original, authentic state.

Brother Xu Chi, you don't need to do this for me.

It's fine. I'm not suffering now.

my older sister said that you never studied

and always took last place in tests, and you were always punished to stand in the hallway.

How did you come back and turn into an outstanding young talent?

But our company

does not have much experience in entertainment production, so—

It's about the interview.

It's really embarrassing. It's our issue at work.

00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,170
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

644
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:53,870
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

645
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:58,000
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

646
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,950
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

647
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:09,720
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

648
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,800
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

649
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,790
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

650
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:26,820
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

651
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,730
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

652
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:45,030
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
