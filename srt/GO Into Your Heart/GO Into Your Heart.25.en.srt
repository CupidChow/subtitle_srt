17
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,060
[Episode 25]

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,660
Don't look so sad. It's just a GO game.

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,170
Look. Sheng Jingchu's face looks so haggard.

20
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,700
He's been taking care of my dad all this time. It's too hard on him.

21
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,300
He's already won five games. It's nothing to lose this round. It'll even let Yao Ke get some respect.

22
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,080
He and Yao Ke are both brothers of Jiuzhou Hall. If he really lets Yao Ke have a crushing defeat,

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,210
wouldn't it be awkward when they go back and see each other again?

24
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,490
I think this beauty...

25
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,980
What are you calling me?

26
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,540
- Teacher.
- Before that?

27
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,760
- Beauty.
- Continue.

28
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,310
She is quite right. This round's win isn't that important.

29
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,540
If Jingchu's isn't in good condition during this game,

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,410
he should go home and get a good rest. Then he can fight again.

31
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,010
After all, he has already won five games. His winning probability is really high.

32
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,760
For all the GO fans,

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,510
to be able to enjoy one more game between

34
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,220
two ninth-dan experts, it's a good thing.

35
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,260
In that case, will Sheng Jingchu lose this game?

36
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,850
Before the match, Yao Ke bragged that he could win six games.

37
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,980
That's already burst like bubbles.

38
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,170
Can he really get a crushing defeat?

39
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,110
He'll definitely exert full force in the next five games to get a tie.

40
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,780
It's too early to say if he can get a tie.

41
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,720
But if he defeats Sheng Jingchu in this game, it would still be big news.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,640
It would be the first time in 10 years.

43
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,840
Junior Brother Yao Ke's corner move may be trying to buy so time.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,520
Looking forward to seeing white's move to counter it.

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,190
Next, let's see how Senior Brother Jingchu will counter it.

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,020
Senior Brother Jing, this one motion capture is just perfect.

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,800
If the black makes a small diagonal move, the white moves from its own area into blacks and then uses it to enclose.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,290
The black jumps in line to widen into the eye position. The whitetails to the corner to block it.
(TN: Opponent's piece is surrounded except the middle which looks like an eye.)

49
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,200
The first white piece by chance defended the second black piece from squeezing.

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
This will bring us to the endgame phase while he fortifies his territory.

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,790
This must be quite a blow to Senior Brother Ke.

52
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,340
We can see that Junior Yao Ke's move

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,880
is to make up for the loss playing the 3-3 point.

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,800
If White blocks here, Black can initiate a capture fight.

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,370
That way, previously the black piece that vainly died in the corner

56
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,070
can become useful as a raiding force.

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,340
Senior Brother Jing's move to probe occurred at just the right time.

58
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,010
Junior Brother Yao Ke looks like he has been numbed by this.

59
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,790
Everybody, the meaning of 'numbed' here is, it makes one suddenly feel uncomfortable.

60
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,840
Debating this way and that way but still difficult to choose.

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,120
To put it plainly, placing the piece anywhere on the board will make you feel uncomfortable.

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,140
Then this move would have achieved its goal.

63
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
Junior Brother Yao Ke's pick up here seems like a vulnerable move.

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,510
But that doesn't affect the win or loss. It looks like Back is in a better state.

65
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,000
This massive impressive turn has reversed the numbed Senior Brother Jing.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,330
Looks like Junior Brother Yao Ke is still holding a grudge over the previous 3.3 moves.

67
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,900
Master, Uncle Cheng is in the hospital because of me.

68
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,010
If you end up losing the game because the car accident affected you,

69
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,610
I would become a sinner for all ages. Please do your best.

70
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,680
This move looks like it is likely played to probe a reaction from white.

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,160
For the sake of safety, if white chooses to block, then black gains an eye advantage.

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,660
If white doesn't want to lose an eye and chooses to fill a different area, would the empty area be played on?

73
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,090
Master, you must persist, you must persist.

74
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,500
You must persist, Master! Good luck!

75
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,580
Just now, the white piece gained an advantage in the last stage.

76
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,920
So is it to retreat to make sure there are no pieces in the area or take the risk to protect the score.

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,150
This is another mental challenge from Junior Brother Ke to Senior Brother Jing.

78
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,540
This is too shameful.

79
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,520
Previously in the top left corner, Junior Brother Yao Ke‘s pieces by Senior Brother Jing's 3.3 move

80
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,230
was cornered and captured.

81
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,030
In the upper right-hand corner, he wants to get an easy play,

82
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,540
but Senior Brother Jing was able to skillfully resolve it. So, he couldn't gain any advantage at all.

83
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,990
Now, he's playing him into a dead end. That has to be too hard to accept.

84
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,010
If Junior Brother Yao Ke can control his mood,

85
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,220
if the black continues normally in this last stage, there's still a high chance of winning.

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,600
Why did Junior Brother Yao Ke not knock off the bottom white piece?

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,250
Black will lose completely then.

88
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,950
[Black - 14 pieces. White - 12 pieces.]

89
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,540
Yao Ke keeps making mistakes, your GO God will win.

90
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,400
Eldest Senior Brother, I heard Xiao Lan and Xihe say that

91
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,670
Junior Brother Yao Ke's loss this time is very strange.

92
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,370
Will he reverse the game?

93
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,560
The game does look a little strange.

94
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,440
But I can understand how terrible Xiao Ke feels now.

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,980
He should know that he is about to lose, and he is anxiously trying to finish the game.

96
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,130
That's why he carelessly made a bad move.

97
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,120
Do you see? Jingchu keeps capturing. He's playing very smart.

98
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
If he makes a wrong move,

99
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,740
black will use a raid move to capture the rest.

100
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,250
This way, Black will have the chance to reverse the game.

101
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,800
Yet right now, the difference between the white and black

102
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,420
is very, very small.

103
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,420
White, 177. Sheng Jingchu wins by a quarter stone.

104
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,770
What's White's score?

105
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,830
177.

106
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,650
White piece?

107
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,630

He took the 10 games GO match too seriously.

155
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,860
It will be difficult for him to recover from this.

156
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,060
To be honest, in the key moments where Junior Yao Ke lost to Senior Brother Jing,

157
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,090
he lost in the most upsetting and heartbreaking ways.

158
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,400
If I were in his place, I wouldn't be able to accept it either.

159
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,490
Everyone has a different mentality.

160
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,860
For some, being as accomplished as he is would have been enough.

161
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,310
Second place isn't something anyone can get because they want it.

162
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,640
But for others, they will never be satisfied with second place.

163
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,520
I grew up with Senior Brother Jing,

164
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,710
and I'm much closer to him.

165
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,620
But when I saw how Junior Yao Ke looked today,

166
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,150
I felt so upset for him.

167
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,110
He's already very successful. Isn't that good enough?

168
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,550
We're from the same hall, but he lost so miserably.

169
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,490
All right, dry your tears. Don't cry, okay?

170
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,320
Why do they have to choose who's better between the two?

171
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,960
That's why my father always told us

172
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,760
that GO isn't simply about winning or losing, but also about the relationships you share with people.

173
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,460
An obsession with winning

174
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,240
makes winning impossible and causes you to forget your original intent.

175
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,280
What's left will only be suffering.

176
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,890
Let's drink.

177
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,580
You should stop drinking.

178
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,560
I have to go brew him some tea to replenish his energy, blood, and mind!

179
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,250
Senior Brother, be careful!

180
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,170
When he recovers and returns,

181
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,570
no one can mention anything about the 10 game GO match.

182
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,220
That scared me.

183
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,580
All right. Have some of this.

184
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,310
I didn't expect that the 10-game GO match that was hotly discussed online

185
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,880
would have such a sighful ending.

186
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,240
Liao Liao, I used to be a lot like Yao Ke.

187
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,420
I was obsessed with winning.

188
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,720
Do you remember what I told you?

189
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,010
Obsession is a double-edged sword. You will dedicate yourself to progress,

190
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,770
but you will also be sent deeper into a pit.

191
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,510
You brought me to a wide, open space.

192
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,700
Junior Yao Ke

193
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,330
seems to have fallen further in a pit.

194
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,360
To be honest, I felt a bit bad seeing him today.

195
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,460
Promise you'll never be like him.

196
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,930
I won't. Ever since you came into my life,

197
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,900
I've realized that the world

198
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,360
offers many more precious things than winning.

199
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,190
I think that I'm going to finish

200
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,690
the homework that my teacher left for me.

201
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,180
Panda, you're so weary lately.

202
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,110
Everything is being shouldered by you alone.

203
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,840
Lie down over here. I'll give you a massage.

204

Panda Bear, you've worked hard in taking care of Dad.

205
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,340
I didn't wake you because you were sleeping so soundly.

206
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,920
Get some rest. I'll visit you later.

- What's this?
- A steak gift card.

209
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,730
There's a new steakhouse that just opened.

210
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:18,810
How should I describe the flavor? A taste that should only exist in the heavens.

211
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,830
There's ¥20,000 on it. Take it.
 (around $3,100)

212
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,830
Are you trying to fatten me up?

213
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,130
Dream on. It's for your dad. You'd better not take even a single bite.

214
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,570
I can't cook soup or make anything. And your dad injured his leg, right?

215
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,780
This will help him get better. It tastes good and it's revitalizing.

216
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,410
20,000 yuan?

217
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,220
You're pretty generous.

218
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,670
It's my boyfriend's restaurant.

219
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,900
So you're just helping his business?

220

That's not wrong.

Recently the company organized all the new projects.

226
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,870
There‘s information about a cooking competition.

227

They'll be talking about it in the meeting later. Take a good look at it.

[Good Food, Good Taste]

229
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,170
Actually, I think the so-called cooking competition is just a format.

230
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,900
There are really two layers of the content that we strive to express.

231
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,910
First, to promote the traditional food culture of China.

232
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,960
Second, find the food experts who are hidden among the regular people and give them a platform

233
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,300
to tell their stories through food.

234
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,720
My preliminary concept is to use "Hermit in the Market" as the theme,

235
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,670
using the top four Chinese traditional cuisines or the eight cuisines as the content.

236
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,090
The format of the program is mainly structured with such competition segments

237
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,900
such as general audition, elimination, advancement, and coordinated with online streaming,

238
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,440
to let those cooking gods scattered among regular walks of life enter people's sight.

You're here, so why did you call me?

Uncle Cheng, I bought your favorite Braised Pork Trotters.

253
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,400
It's from that old brand.

It's very easy. Just get a packet and heat it up.

So many? How long will it take for me to keep eating?

You can just slowly eat them up.

Uncle Cheng, Older Sister won't let me come to the hospital.

So, I haven't dared to come and visit you.

That's right.

294

No way. You are not wearing much. I'll close it.

It feels a little like little ants crawling around.

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,400
The showerhead isn't turned off.

312
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,100
Xiao Yi, go take a look to see if it's turned off.

313
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,300
Take a look. Take a look.

314
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,500
I don't hear anything.

315
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
There's nothing wrong. It's turned off well.

316
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,400
You must be having auditory hallucinations. It's too cold. I better close the window.

317
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
I'm in the room all day. Wouldn't I hear hallucinations?

318
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
It's okay now. Let's eat.

319
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,200
Dad, pay attention.

320
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
It's not me.

321
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Who is it then?

322
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,200
It is me.

323
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,600
There's another window here. How about opening it, too?

324
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,400
What did you eat for lunch?

325
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,800
What are you doing?

326
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,000
Brother, open the door!

327
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,000
Brother?

328
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,600
Open the door, Brother.

329
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Brother, you've shut yourself in the room for two days already.

330
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,200
Brother.

331
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Can't you say something to me?

332
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,000
Brother?

333
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,900
Brother.

334
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
Your hair.

335
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Where's the set of teacups that Sheng Jingchu gave me?

336
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
It's right here, Brother.

337
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,700
So it's here.

338
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,990
During these two days, I've thought through a couple of things.

339
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,600
The first is,

340
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,400
I'll never be able to defeat

341
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,200
Sheng Jinchu in GO in my lifetime.

342
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,600
I can't get past this obstacle. Even when success is right in front of me,

343
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
I can only just take a look.

344
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Brother, don't listen to that nonsense online.

345
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,400
There's the second thing.

346
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,300
That is since I can't defeat him,

347
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,400
then...

348
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,660
That one who ran away from the accident a few days ago

349
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,800
is named Yang Xiaoyu, right?

350
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,600
I think so.

351
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,000
Help me with something, Xiao Pu.

352
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,600
Help me contact his family.

353
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
- Brother, are you really—
- Do it.

354
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,400
Do as I say.

355
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,000
Sir, your tea.

356
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,800
Okay, thank you.

357
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,900
Come, come! The two older brothers, please sit.

358
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,000
Why did you ask me to be here?

359
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
Let me say this first.

360
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,000
I am Sheng Jingchu's lawyer. I am only relaying a message for him today.

361
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,500
Sheng Jingchu?

362
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,800
He's that GO player who helped the police view the video.

363
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,600
If it weren't for him, Xiaoyu wouldn't have been expelled by the school.

364
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,200
He is going to sue you guys now.

365
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Here, the attorney's letter.

366
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
- Sue us? Is he not done yet?
- Lao Er.

367
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Big Brother, don't be upset. Sit down first and we'll talk.

368
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,060
To tell you the truth, as the lawyer,

369
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,400
I don't understand why he is suing you.

370
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,700
They've caught the guy. The medical bills have been compensated.

371
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,800
That's right.

372
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
See? He insists on suing you.

373
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,600
I don't understand either why he has to ride on your head and pee.

374
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,000
You must be tired of having stayed with my dad for a whole day.

375
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,400
Uncle Cheng can go to the restroom by himself now.

376
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,400
I only need to help him a little when he is getting off and back in the bed.

377
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,200
All other times, I can enjoy Chef Cheng

378
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,000
using his precise knife skill to cut fruits for me.

379
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,800
See? Don't I look better now?

380
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,200
That's right.

381
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,500
Our energetic little Panda Bear is the most handsome.

382
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,890
Look at this.

383
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,410
Do you want to participate?

384
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,800
My dad and older sister definitely won't let me participate.

385
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,200
Why?

386
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,400
I wanted to study cooking after I graduated from college, but Dad told me,

387
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,400
"Zhiliao, I've been a cook all my life.

388
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,200
I didn't achieve much. So you'd better not suffer from the smoke and fire either."

389
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,000
I can sense how you enjoy the process of cooking tasty food.

390
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
You don't feel any suffering.

391
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,100
But have you heard this before?

392
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,200
Your dad thinks you are suffering.

393
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
Besides, in my dad's eyes,

394
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
my older sister is the role model for success.

395
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,600
I only need to keep rushing toward my sister as the goal.

396
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,600
That's why he begged to get me into Pinecone Video.

397
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
- Liao Liao.
- Let's not talk about it anymore.

398
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,600
I still need to deliver food to the starving old man Cheng Fengshou.

399
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,800
Let him try his daughter's cooking.

400
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,300
[Hermit in the Market]

401
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,300
This smells really good.

402
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,100
Let me try.

403
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Wow.

404
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Our little Zhiliao's cooking is getting better and better.

405
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
You should try it, too.

406
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,600
I've tried it already.

407
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,400
Dad, you should drink more. If you want, I'll cook more.

408
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
No, no, no.

409
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,000
I heard your sister and Xu Chi say there's a new program in the company.

410
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,400
You must do well at work, don't always run into the kitchen.

411
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,500
A girl should look clean, don't get greasy smoke all over herself. Understand?

412
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,400
Understood.

413
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Drink some more.

414
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,400
I don't want to drink it fast. I'll sip it slowly.

Liao Liao, about Pinecone Video's cooking competition,

428
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,000
I've filled out the application form.

429
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's up to you to decide whether you will enter.

430
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,830
You called me here today to tell me this?

431
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,430
I remember you told me before.

432
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:46,880
"It's great to win, but it's also okay to lose."

433
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,150
Today, I'm returning this line to you.

434
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,080
But I'm different from you.

435
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,470
Liao Liao, I've tried your cooking many times.

436
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,500
Therefore, I have the right to comment.

437
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,660
You cook from the bottom of your heart.

438
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,140
You were also born with a good sense of smell.

439
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,520
You have a natural advantage for making great food.

440
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,280
When you cook, you're persistent to your personal taste.

441
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,820
That's your talent.

442
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,320
Surpass ordinary people's talent.

443
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,600
Is it like your talent on GO games?

444
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,590
If not better.

445
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,930
My talent is from my hard work.

446
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,370
But you're a natural-born genius.

447
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,790
Liao Liao,

448
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,350
I believe in you.

449
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,710
You also need to believe in yourself.

450
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,960
[Submit]

451
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,350
That's it! I regret it already.

452
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,860
Can I withdraw now?

453
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,500
No.

454
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,230
Don't worry.

455
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,550
I will always be there for you.

456
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,770
Xiao Pu, what do you think about this style?

457
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,180
Does it look like my previous hairstyle?

458
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,890
Xiao Pu!

459
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,810
Not really.

460
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,430
Brother, why don't you dye your hair?

461
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,850
The grey roots will grow out in a few days. It'll still look white.

462
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,740
I don't want people to think I'm scruffy.

463
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,890
Brother, tell me, what I'm doing right now is a little...

464
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,670
What about it?

465
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,200
...is it a bit unethical?

466
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,010
Unethical?

467
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,330
Sheng Jingchu has completely destroyed me.

468
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,140
I lost my name and reputation.

469
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,840
That Yang Xiaoyu totally asked for it.

470
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,290
Do you think I deserve to be like this?

471
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,540
You are right. That Sheng Jingchu is total heartless,

472
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,290
he never considered your feelings.

473
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,740
Brother, I think I understand now.

474
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,170
No matter what you say or do, I'll support you.

475
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,080
Master Xie and Master Jiang, you both are here.

476
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,020
Come on in. Please take a seat.

477
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,290
- Master, let me take this.
- Good! Xiao Ke.

478
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,580
To both of my masters,

479
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,630
I apologize. Sorry for making you feel worried.

480
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,040
Please take a seat.

481
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,070
Xiao Pu.

482
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,280
Please take a seat and the food will be here shortly.

483
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,130
Good!

484
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,440
Initially, I wanted to take Old Xie to

485
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,280
spend some time at my friend's tea farm in Yunnan.

486
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,400
When we heard you fainted, we both couldn't stay still.

487
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,990
We decided to return right away.

488
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,590
His energy looks okay.

489
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,980
He recovered pretty fast.

490
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,750
I'm not bad.

491
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,320
Earlier, I was fixated on studying GO matches,

492
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,420
and I didn't realize I was exhausting myself,

493
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,700
so didn't get enough sleep.

494
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:39,090
As for the 10-game GO match, I thought I had a chance to win.

495
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,100
With 6:0 end result,

496
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,910
it was a bit unsettling.

497
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,140
I saw the competition.

498
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,820
You were supposed to win at least 2 matches.

499
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:55,870
It's because you were too eager to win,

500
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,500
you lost because of psychological reasons.

501
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,630
Remember, when you chase after your opponent from behind,

502
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,270
you always need to run faster and work harder.

503
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,990
Always dedicate extra efforts.

504
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,740
On the other hand, I want to advise you

505
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,720
not to overanalyze things.

506
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,240
I've told you before,

507
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,280
why do you want to be number one?

508
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,530
You need to accept that people have different talents.

509
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,870
In the world of GO,

510
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:35,590
it's not just about victory and defeat, there are also about the art of GO.

511
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,720
Don't dwell on winning,

512
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,480
it'll cause problems.

513
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,440
If all GO players are as stubborn as you,

514
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,070
then those Japanese GO players who competed with Master Wu back in the days,

515
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,360
they would all be in the dead-ends.

516
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,680
Old Jiang, your words are wrong.

517
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,900
You can't use those words to teach kids.

518
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,050
Where's the wine? Hurry up!

519
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,380
- It's coming.
- Pour me some wine.

520
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,710
Here, Brother.

521
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,520
Master Xie, please take some wine.

522
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,420
Good. Xiao Ke.

523
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,350
Don't be fixated on the game results

524
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,120
or talent.

525
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,330
The key is you have to change your attitude.

526
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,540
The goal of the game is not to defeat your opponents.

527
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,310
It is to learn more about yourself.

528
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:27,040
Your rival is not a certain person,

529
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,640
but the GO game itself.

530
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,480
Of course, when you practice hard, it is for your own good as well.

531
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,170
Only if you keep improving yourself,

532
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,280
then your ability will surpass the old you.

533
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,810
The important point is to maintain a calm attitude.

534
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,800
That will make my student here

535
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,890
become a GO master in the near future.

536
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,490
You are right, Master Xie.

537
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,860
You can talk better than I can.

538
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,060
In the same speech, you present it better than me.

539
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,680
All I want to say is he shouldn't keep thinking about defeating

540
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,610
Xiao Jingchu.

541
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,930
He just needs to play his best game.

542
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,240
Okay, stop right there. I'm not letting you carry on talking.

543
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,700
Today, I'm here to drink with my disciple.

544
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,910
You are not allowed to mention anything related to GO.

545
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,660
Come on, let's drink.

546
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,520
I salute you, Masters.

547
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,630
Here.

548
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,250
Come on.

549
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,940
Should I ask my dad for a taste test?

550
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,220
Do you think he would say they aren't any good,

551
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,060
what am I going to do?

552
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,570
It's impossible. It will be good.

553
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,550
I don't believe you.

554
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,620
You always say it's good for everything I make.

555
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,130
What are you doing here?

556
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,820
Do you recognize me?

557
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:46,390
♫ The wind blows,
The moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

558
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:50,390
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

559
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,820
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

560
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,670
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

561
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,610
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

562
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,600
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

563
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,140
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

564
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:15,230
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

565
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:21,170
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

566
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:27,170
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

567
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,110
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

568
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:46,400
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

569
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:07,730
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

570
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,770
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

571
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,350
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

572
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,050
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

573
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,160
♫ There is color all around you ♫

574
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,030
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

575
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:32,950
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

576
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,870
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

577
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:50,310
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

578
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:54,570
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

579
00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:00,630
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

580
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:06,480
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

581
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,460
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

582
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,330
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

583
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:22,500
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

584
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:30,520
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

585
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:41,980
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
