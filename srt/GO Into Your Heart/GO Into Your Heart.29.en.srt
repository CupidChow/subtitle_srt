I feel that she's full of confidence.

123
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,810
But Yang Yunfei looks a little nervous.

124
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,830
Based on that, doesn't Xiao Lan have the advantage?

125
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,880
Is what I said wrong?

126
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,310
You are quite right.

127
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,730
Xiao Lan's play is very fierce today.

128
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,940
She is also exerting her full strength.

129
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,170
By contrast, Yang Yunfei's play is constrained.

130
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,400
Previously, I was concerned that Xiao Lan would be

131
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,940
affected by the incident from the last game.

132
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,800
It appears that I've worried too much.

133
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,000
I knew it. My little junior sister is good.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,660
- Your junior sister?
- Yes.

135
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,840
She is your junior sister and you are with me. I abbreviated it as

136

You are right about everything.

Yang Yunfei is stoically chasing under while he is disadvantaged.

139
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,810
If White can safeguard the two corners on the left,

140
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,900
Ding Lan won't necessarily win.

141
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,420
Right now, Yang Yunfei blocked a move in black's corner.

142
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,350
How will Ding Lan respond to it?

143
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,200
Cut one and just exchange some.

144
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,010
The two-spaced position has the initiative.

145

But you should also consider the feelings of people around you.

154

You can't injure someone yesterday and injure another today.

00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,900
Yay, my junior sister won!

163
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,520
Xiao Lan won.

164
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,540
Senior Brother He, I won.

165
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,340
I knew you would win.

166
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,070
You are awesome.

167
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,000
I won.

168
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,950
Shouldn't you be happy about winning? Why are you crying? Don't cry.

169
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,150
But you... But you withdrew from the competition because of me.

170
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,710
Otherwise, you would always win too.

171
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,820
How can I keep winning? There is still Senior Brother Jing.

172
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,440
Isn't that right?

173
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,940
Senior Brother He.

174
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,170
I've discovered that I was really too silly before.

175
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,650
I never knew that you would treat me so well

176
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,310
and willing to give up so much for me.

177
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,100
Xiao Lan,

178
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,500
sometimes I don't know if you are truly silly or not.

179
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,810
If I'm not good to you, how many other people in this world can dare say that they are good to you?

180
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,470
Why do I trouble myself to keep doing these tricks every day?

181
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,890
Who is it that I'm trying to please?

182
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,240
Aren't I just trying to amuse you?

183
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,200
Too bad, no matter how much trouble I give myself,

184
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,620
I can't match those idols in your heart.

185
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,070
Not to mention Jo Yeon Hoon.

186
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,820
Jo Yeon Hoon? I... Ever since I found out Jo Yeon Hoon concealed that he had a girlfriend,

187
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,120
I'm not his fan anymore. Besides,

188
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,970
I've suddenly discovered that the real you right now

189
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,240
is particularly handsome, even more handsome by a hundred times

190
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,980
than all of the idols I follow.

191
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,800
Do you like the real me?

192
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,110
Why didn't you say so earlier?

193
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,980
If you were normal earlier, it would have been okay.

194
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,320
You're always playacting this or that. I didn't know what you were doing.

195
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,940
Do you think I really want to playact a character every day?

196
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,500
I just didn't know what type you liked? I couldn't guess your thoughts either.

197
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,820
I could only change the character I playacted every day.

198
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,200
I'm very tired, too.

199
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,620
You don't have to do all that silly nonsense anymore. Get it?

200
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,290
- Hello, Director Liu.
 - Cheng Liao.

201
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,520
This time you absolutely must get me some hot topic, no matter what.

202
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,740
Don't worry. Isn't it just about Xiao Lan beating Yang Yunfei? I'll definitely get it.

203
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,460
It's not about Ding Lan. It's He Yu.

204
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,420
That's her. The 5-dan female player who beat Zhou Lichuan.

205
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,830
No one paid her attention in the beginning. We just thought she was a pretty girl.

206
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,570
Unexpectedly she is a dark horse.

207
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,410
7-dan Zhou Lichuan...

208
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,340
Sheng Jingchu.

209
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,220
I'm He Yu. Hope you'll give guidance in the upcoming games.

210
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,060
Please give guidance as well.

211
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,850
Sheng Jingchu.

212
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,090
We played GO together when we were kids.

213
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,270
After I left the country, I haven't come back often to compete.

214
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,300
But I have persisted every day in training in GO.

215
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,190
Recently I watched your 10-Game GO match. I suddenly realized

216
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,810
how touched I am for someone.

217
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,160
I came back this time to compete in order to meet you again.

218
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,930
I like you.

219
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,380
- He has a girlfriend.
- I know.

220
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,550
But I'm more suited for him.

221
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,760
You should be with me.

222
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,680
Have you been waiting for long?

223
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,720
Hello, I am an editor from Pinecone Video, Cheng Liao.

224
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,630
You played GO so beautifully just now.

225
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,600
Carefree like floating clouds and water, the aura is overflowing.

226
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,560
I'm very happy that you've accepted my interview. Let's start then.

227
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,780
Where is Sheng Jingchu?

228
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,640
He's taking a break.

229
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,470
I saw you two entering the competition together.

230
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,610
It must be boring to be dating a professional GO player.

231
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,440
- What do you mean?
- If I am guessing right,

232
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,480
you don't know much about GO.

233
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,120
How can you communicate with a professional 9-dan?

234
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,680
Only a genius can understand a genius. That's why I've changed my mind.

235
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,810
I don't want to be interviewed by someone who is too much beneath my level.

236
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,210
Unless it's Sheng Jingchu who interviews me.

237
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,770
Sure.

238
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,280
You sold me out so easily?

239
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,530
Why do you think I would agree?

240
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,160
Just because you're my girlfriend?

241
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,250
It's absolutely impossible for me to agree.

242
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,060
May I ask... what is your goal on this professional road in GO?

243
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,110
To meet you, to play against you, and to be with you.

244
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,790
So direct.

245
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,470
It's not finished yet.

246
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,530
- I don't want to interview her.
- You promised me.

247
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,360
Be good.

248
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,510
Do you think you can defeat Sheng Jingchu?

249
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,740
Either way is fine, as long as you're happy.

250
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,570
Who wrote the questions?

251
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,190
Auntie Liu. Hurry and ask her.

252
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,760
What type of GO player do you think you are?

253
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,910
Simple, direct, kill with one blow.

254
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,290
Regarding Mr. Sheng Jingchu's...

255
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,340
Regarding Mr. Sheng Jingchu's romance, what is your opinion?

256
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,280
It's thoroughly a mistake.

257
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,460
He should be with me. Between GO players, there is an innate tacit understanding.

258
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,030
- Are you confident?
- Of course.

259
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,650
Sorry.

260
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,910
What's the matter?

261
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,300
You... are actually not jealous at all?

262
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,180
Why... should I be jealous?

263
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,420
Because I trust you completely.

264
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,430
But I don't want to even be in front of her for a second.

265
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,840
Then I am even less jealous.

266
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,700
Therefore,

267
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,040
you are deliberately tormenting me.

268
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,260
The whole world likes you.

269
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,020
But you belong only to me alone.

270
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,580
I think this is the happiest thing.

271
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,670
Guess! Which kind of "You" is this?
 (T/N: "You" is homonym for Pomelo)

272
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,110
It's...

273
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,640
Fall in love

274
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,770
with

275
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,080
you.

276
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,570
All audience friends in front of the TV, what you see now

277
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,920
the final match of the Super Slow GO Tournament.

278
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,740
Sheng Jingchu, 9-dan, will battle against

279
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,700
the most surprising dark horse in this competition,

280
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,170
5-dan He Yu.

281
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,410
The two of them have just begun to lay out their formations.

282
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,290
Wow, so fierce.

283
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,470
He Yu can face off Senior Brother Jing at the final match.

284
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,420
That's one of my dreams, too.

285
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,590
Xiao Lan, the reason that He Yu can play against Jingchu

286
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,040
is only because she took an easy advantage.

287
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,940
What are you saying?

288
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,970
No, no, no. She didn't take advantage. It's fine.

289
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,990
Don't keep mentioning that.

290
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,050
So what if one can't get into the final match?

291
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,070
I was always tortured by Senior Brother Jing in Jiuzhou Hall.

292
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,690
Do I have to announce that I was tortured by Senior Brother Jing?

293
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,870
[Sheng Jingchu, 9th dan]
[He Yu, 5th dan]

294
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,550
What an interesting move!

295
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,250
Testing the efficiency is something Senior Brother Jing would do.

296
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,540
Is He Yu provoking him?

297
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,030
I could smell the gunpowder in the air from the beginning of the match.

298
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,900
It's getting entertaining.

299
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,700
The move He Yu pulled off was extremely merciless!

300
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,870
She is trying to start a knock-down-drag-out fight with Sheng Jingcchu.

301
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,530
The black stones got split in two. It doesn't look like an ideal situation.

302
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,810
Now it's time to calculate and predict the next move.

303
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,760
Is he at a disadvantage?

304
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,420
It can't be.

305
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,790
But that corner

306
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,100
puts him in a difficult position.

307
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,880
Listen. If he proceeds to use the black corner to make a life out of the stones,

308
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,630
he will leave the entire large area to the white stones.

309
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,280
It'll interrupt the moves of the black stones.

310
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,060
Jingchu is a bit adamant here.

311
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,230
Little Sister-in-Law, don't worry.

312
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,990
Sheng Jingchu is very smart.

313
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,000
I think he is enticing He Yu.

314
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,800
Amazing!

315
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,040
He is taking full control of the white stones.

316
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,880
What exactly is Sheng Jingchu's strategy?

317
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,680
We are looking forward to it.

318
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,180
Sheng Jingchu wins!

319
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,640
This is the first time I'm happy to lose.

320
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,560
I hope we can often meet each other.

321
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,710
Let go.

322
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,660
It is rare to see He Yu smiling throughout the match.

323
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,290
It must be an amazing game for her.

324
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,150
Sister Cheng Liao, how can you smile now?

325
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,270
Don't you think there is something strange between He Yu and Senior Brother Jing?

326
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,280
I know. So what?

327
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,310
He is mine!

328
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,040
Wait for me.

329
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,700
Senior Brother, when do you think I'll have that kind of confidence?

330
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,110
Should be soon.

331
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,810
- Put this over your side.
- Thank you.

332
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,540
- Here.
- Thanks.

333
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,570
That one is for you. This one is mine.

334
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,060
Oh, let me exchange my seat with Senior Brother Jing.

335
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,220
Wait… why?

336
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,520
When we both sat at the business class and he sat at economy class,

337
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,370
didn't you say you rather sit with him?

338
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,880
Actually, I think you

339
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,360
sitting here is rather good.

340
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,890
Don’t look at me like that, drink your water.

341
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,630
Wait!

342
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,500
Are you okay?

343
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,730
It’s okay. You don’t need to...

344
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,960
Drink your water.

345
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,770
I’m okay! I’m okay!

346
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,640
I’m cooler now.

347
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,420
It’s too warm here.

348
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,160
Drink some water.

349
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,680
I’m not thirsty.

350
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,140
Senior Brother. Little Sister-in-Law.

351
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,710
You don’t need to do that.

352
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,680
This is just our regular behavior.

353
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,020
Practice makes perfect.

354
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,360
You’ll be improving.

355
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:48,060
Sister Cheng Liao, we're not together yet.

356
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,400
- Not yet?
- Of course not!

357
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,230
Senior Brother He, are you all right?

358
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,010
I’m all right.

359
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,400
Ask the plane if it is all right.

360
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,870
I see you are determined.

361
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,720
I‘ve been causing you so many troubles during my employment.

362
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,680
Thank you very much.

363
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,200
You just joined the company,

364
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,700
I was planning to assign you to important projects.

365
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,290
If you’ve decided to follow your goals,

366
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,540
I’ll not insist to keep you here.

367
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,160
No matter what you do in the future, keep up the good work.

368
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,230
Thank you!

369
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,240
Can I make a small suggestion?

370
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,920
What is it? Tell me.

371
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,020
Can you remember her name?

372
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,820
Who?

373
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,460
That one?

374
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,200
Her name is Yan Xiao. Yan as in language, Xiao as in sunrise.

375
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,100
She is the most hardworking person here.

376
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,280
She prepared everything ahead of time,

377
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,470
before you even asked her to do so.

378
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,900
That’s why everybody here calls her “Yan Encyclopedia.”

379
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,560
I believe if you can remember her name,

380
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,520
don’t call her “that one over there,”

381
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,050
she’ll work even harder.

382
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,360
Okay. I’ll remember that.

383
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,600
Thank you, Director.

384
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,840
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

385
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,700
Zhiliao.

386
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,020
Brother Xu.

387
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,690
Your sister told me everything. Why didn’t you give me a heads up?

388
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,160
I was planning to tell you after the interview.

389
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,780
Starting a business is good news.

390
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,710
I’ll support you. You can do it.

391
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,810
Thank you, Brother Xu. You can do it, too.

392
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,700
You are forever my family member.

393
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,640
I’m leaving now.

394
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,780
Goodbye.

395
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,920
Everybody, I’m sorry for bringing so much trouble

396
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,950
during my time here.

397
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,330
Thank you, everyone.

398
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
We should all be thanking you instead.

399
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,810
You bought so much food for us.

400
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,110
That’s right. Thank you, Cheng Liao.

401
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,670
Cheng Liao, good luck.

402
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,840
Good luck.

403
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,000
Thank you, everyone.

404
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,910
Goodbye.

405
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,160
Cheng “little girl.”

406
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,040
I knew you would be waiting for me here.

407
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,070
I’m warning you.

408
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,720
You are forbidden to have another bestie in the new company.

409
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,200
I’ll be my own boss at the restaurant, where can I find a friend?

410
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,330
Will you count Sheng Jingchu?

411
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,620
Yes. He can't either.

412
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,620
You're right, that’s not possible.

413
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,640
I do want to see him in this scenario.

414
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,880
Let’s go!

415
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,980
When you have trouble, remember to contact me.

416
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,070
I can resolve all your problems. Don’t forget me.

417
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,910
If I don’t have trouble, why would I contact you?

418
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,150
Stop carrying that around!

419
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,880
You should look your best!

420
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,040
Where is "that one"?

421
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,980
Yan...Yan... Po Xiao!

422
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,610
Be grateful. I've done everything I could.

423
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,110
I'm coming!

424
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,530
Good Luck, Yan Po Xiao!

425
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,220
Good Luck, Xiao Cheng!

426
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,650
I'm leaving.

427
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,220
Why are you here, Panda?

428
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,670
I'm saying goodbye to the past with you.

429
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,650
Let's start over again together.

430
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,470
Did you get these from the greenhouse?

431
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,430
Welcome!

432
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,590
Boss Cheng!

433
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,750
You are a boss now. That's a new feeling.

434
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:26,580
Although I couldn't bear leaving my friends from the office,

435
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,810
but I'm however feeling kind of special now.

436
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,690
I'm feeling invincible!

437
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,810
Even before becoming the owner of this small restaurant,

438
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,030
I found this place pretty good.

439
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,850
Just that now I feel as if it's missing something!

440
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,310
- What does it lack?
- I am the second owner! Of course, it lacks my touch.

441
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,290
- Why? Do you want to renovate the place?
- No.

442
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,260
As an owner, I should take the costs into consideration.

443
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,340
I can't be wasteful when I haven't even opened for business yet.

444
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,350
If a decorate it a bit, I think it should be okay.

445
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,580
Let's take a walk together.

446
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,760
All right, I will listen to the boss.

447
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,640
Do you know? The way you are now,

448
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,510
all the girls in the world would love you to death.

449
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,030
I know that there's at least one girl named He Yu.

450
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,510
I don't need them.

451
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,780
The boss' love is all I need.

452
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,340
How boring is that? Why not change one?

453
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm not changing.

454
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,930
You will always be new and my favorite type.

455
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,050
That's right, the boss likes more loyal employees.

456
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,640
However, the boss can't find any inspiration here.

457
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,050
Look around at how ordinary this is.

458
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,540
I got it. I need to place you in the store.

459
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,400
Do you want me to go to your store to be a statue?

460
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,560
How could I let you do that?

461
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,160
I have to put two things in the store.

462
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,180
The first thing is a panda and another would be GO.

463
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,110
I understand pandas.

464
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,710
But GO...

465
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,210
You have me.

466
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,740
I'm going to take you to a place tomorrow.

467
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,310
Let's go.

468
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,260
- Senior Brother He.
- You're here.

469
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,820
- Xiao Lan, look.
- Wow, that's a lot.

470
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,310
I brought you a week's worth of snacks.

471
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,870
I'll put it over here.

472
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:29,300
Remember to take it with you when you go to class. Don't forget because you're busy.

473
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,740
I know.

474
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,210
I'll send you back to the campus today. I've seen your class schedule already.

475
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,400
You don't have class on Wednesday. I'll take you to watch a movie then.

476
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,160
The movie you've been talking about is finally out.

477
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,070
I brought premiere tickets.

478
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,020
Wait a minute.

479
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,830
Senior Brother He, what is our relationship right now?

480
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,890
We're...

481
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:59,300
In your heart, I'm already more important than your idol Jo Yeon Hoon.

482
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,800
And I'm a hundred times more handsome than all of your idols combined.

483
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,470
- Of course, we're...
- Purely a junior and senior relationship!

484
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,530
No...

485
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,860
Our relationship developed just a small amount, how did it regress?

486
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,430
Because I haven't reached my own goal of getting to 7-dan yet.

487
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,420
So before that, no matter how much I like

488
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,910
or how flustered I am,

489
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,160
I must bear with it. I can't start dating yet.

490
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,150
Wait.

491
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,540
So, how much do you like me? How flustered are you?

492
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,270
I'm being serious with you.

493
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,000
Xiao Lan, have you carefully thought about it?

494
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,430
Our professional 7-dan isn't like studying.

495
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,690
One year, one dan is not certain.

496
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,970
7-dan can be quick but it can also be a long time.

497
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,340
Are you not willing to wait for me?

498
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,320
Of course, I will. I've already waited for you all these years.

499
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,830
How could I mind waiting for a few more? I'm worried that you'll restrain yourself too much and feel over pressured.

500
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,880
Senior Brother He, I don't have to restrain myself.

501
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,520
I just want to prove myself. No one said or forced me to be an outstanding female GO player.

502
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,000
But this is what I want.

503
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,810
It has always been a firm belief I believed in

504
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,580
and the goal I have been striving for.

505
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,400
I think even if other people don't understand me,

506
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,630
Senior Brother He will. Right?

507
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,850
Fine.

508
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:44,420
As long as you're happy, anything is okay.

509
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,960
I just knew you would support me.

510
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,710
So, do I pick you up on Wednesday? Before the movie, let's go eat something good.

511
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,020
- Didn't we say, we weren't going to date?
- Who said anything about dating?

512
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,300
Senior and juniors can't have a meal or watch a movie together? You didn't eat any less before.

513
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,440
Jeez!

514
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,740
That seems to sound reasonable.

515
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,940
Then Senior Brother He, we agreed that right now, we

516
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,850
can silently like each other in our hearts.

517
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:16,860
However, we will continue to carry on a senior and junior relationship.

518
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,030
Okay, I got it.

519
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,660
Get in the car.

520
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,710
Careful.

521
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,990
Do you have another competition? And you have to go abroad?

522
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,580
It's a mixed tournament abroad.

523
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,720
GO leaders from the association called to discuss if I could attend as a male competitor.

524
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,670
It originally was Yao Ke but after the 10-Game GO match

525
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,860
his condition hasn't been well. He doesn't come out in the public often.

526
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,740
Neither does he compete in competitions.

527
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,530
I couldn't directly refuse the GO association's task.

528
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:13,180
If it's a mixed tournament, then that means there is a female player?

529
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,350
It isn't He Yue, is it?

530
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,850
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

531
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,730
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

532
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,440
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

533
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,040
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

534
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,120
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

535
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,010
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

536
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:05,440
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

537
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,610
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

538
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:15,470
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

539
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:21,530
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

540
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,460
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

541
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:39,800
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

542
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:02,170
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

543
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:06,200
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

544
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,730
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

545
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,330
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

546
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:18,530
♫ There is color all around you ♫

547
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:22,320
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

548
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,740
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

549
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,110
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

550
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:44,880
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

551
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,900
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

552
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,890
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

553
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:00,880
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

554
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,780
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

555
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:10,760
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

556
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:16,820
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

557
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,850
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

558
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:35,680
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
