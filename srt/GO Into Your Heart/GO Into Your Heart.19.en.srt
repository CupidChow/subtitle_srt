Is your refusal to change jobs,

You're afraid that if you come to Pinecone Video but continue to deny my feelings,

I was the worst student and the king of skipping school since childhood.

If I don't come out and clarify,

your sister will be brainwashed and will be influenced into accepting it.

321

Sister Cheng Liao, just think of a way to get me in.

322
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,160
It's already because of you that my sister's program was stopped by the station.

But now she has a better place to be.

Looks like everything is because of Brother Xu Chi. Look how well-matched they are!

Look at you, look at you. Even you're being brainwashed.

327

Let me tell you, who your sister chooses is her decision.

328
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,380
We should equally have the right to pursue her.

329
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,020
We shouldn't use power for personal gains.

330
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:38,060
That's true. What you said makes some sense.

You don't have to care about him. As long as you don't disappoint your sister, it should be all right. Okay?

336
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,700
Maybe your sister wants to break these strange rumors, too.

It's different. It's totally different.

I believe it was really accurate.

442

Especially when you mentioned, "always second."

443

Do you have a desperate desire for first place?

444

I think desire is the motivation to keep improving.

According to what I know, before Sheng Jingchu appeared,

you were the popular contender for many different types of events and competitions.

To put it proudly, it was indeed like that.

449
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,810
Then what about after Sheng Jingchu's appearance into GO?

450
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,730
Can we understand it this way, Sheng Jingchu is

451
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,020
an impassable obstacle on your road to success?

452
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,080
I want to make a correction to a word you said. Impassable.

453
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,990
I believe there are different types of obstacles in this world.

454

But none are of them are impassable.

- Of course.

Let me say it this way.

If I was to go against Sheng Jingchu in a 10 round GO game right now,

A 10 round GO game

466
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,880
is a unique form of competition in GO.

467
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,300
Players play 10 rounds of GO. The first to win 6 rounds wins.

468
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,130
Because there are many rounds, the chances of luck are reduced.

469
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,330
So this can expose the true strengths of both opponents.

473
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,680
It is the ultimate stop between many GO masters. However,

474
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,480
it's been a long time

475
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,700
since there has been anyone brave enough to play it.

476
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,750
Teacher Yao, can I cheekily ask you?

477
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,810
Does this count as an open challenge you are making towards Sheng Jingchu?

478
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:31,160
Ms. Cheng Yi, your overbearing manner is really charming.

479
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,850
Are you helping me dig a hole to jump in?

480
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:38,280
My apologies if I offended you. I am a host. Asking questions is a natural part of my job.

481
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,940
I can understand.

482
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,550
Now that I have said it on the program.

483
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,040
If you really want to say that I'm challenging him,

484
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,980
I guess you can say that. Even if I challenge him now, he may not accept.

485
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,480
Why do you say that?

486
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,270
If you say that the challenger must have boldness,

487
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,260
then the one who accepts the challenge must need enough courage to do it.

488
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,900
Since I've made it pretty clear today,

489
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,450
I'll make be directly clear about it.

490
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:08,750
Senior Brother Jingchu, in my heart,

491
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,710
you're a GO player I really respect.

492
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:18,120
So today I'm officially challenging you to a 10 round GO game.

493
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,110
I'll wait 10 days for you

494
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,880
to accept the challenge.

495
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,890
This is excellent. Look at that.

496
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,360
This is what excellent is.

497
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,930
Look at Teacher Cheng's aura and this quick-thinking mind.

498
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,990
She surely is a big host from the TV station.

499
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,670
About this program content depth

500
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,740
or meaning, I won't say more.

501
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,330
The most important thing was

502
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,620
she provided us with a huge topic.

503
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,180
A 10 round GO game. Too thrilling!

504
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,030
In 10 days' time. Everybody is waiting to hear Sheng Jingchu's answer.

505
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,760
Actually, you've said it too well.

506
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,010
This is just an unexpected gain that came up in our conversation.

507
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,060
It's not quite that simple. Look at this.

508
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,700
Look at the popularity of our show.

509
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,490
It's been 5 days now and it's still trending at the top.

510
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:20,420
In addition, from the first day our program started trending, I found a poll.

511
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,350
More than 80% of netizens support the competition.

512
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,120
And it's still continuing to increase.

513
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,270
Director Xu, I have a small idea.

514
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:32,590
If Sheng Jingchu accepts the 10 round GO game,

515
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:36,670
Pinecone Video should immediately sponsor and film it.

516
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,610
[Maldives]

517
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,950
So today I'm officially challenging you to a 10 round GO game.

518
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:49,570
What are you watching so intently?

519
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,730
My sister's first interview at Pinecone Video.

520
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,570
It was such a pity she wasn't able to produce Unrivaled GO Player.

521
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,210
Now that she got to interview Yao Ke, it's sort of made up for it.

522
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:05,070
Really, that Yao Ke. He loses every time he competes with you

523
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,310
And yet, every time the media interview him, he is indignant.

524
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,740
This time, he's really provoking you more.

525
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,850
The excitement online about the 10 round GO game is even increasing.

526
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,740
You really don't need to respond?
