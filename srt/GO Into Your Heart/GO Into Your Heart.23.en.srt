He said he was going to, but I didn't accept it.

And he would believe you? Did you miss us?

we went to Panda's childhood home where he and his parents used to live.

27
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,320
He told me many of his childhood stories. He also said

there's Victor Hugo, Balzac, and Ernest Hemingway.

These people all have immortal souls.

It was me who first made the dual ladder breaker move.

Yet... how come I still lost?

193

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,470
yet you're here working yourself to death. Is it worth it?

196
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,160
Yao Pu, you don't get it.

197
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,060
It was me who challenged him to this battle.

198
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,240
Besides that, I also said

199

I would defeat him in 6 matches. I can't afford to lose.

200

What's wrong?

201
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,150
Yao Ke lost to you in the first match. He is very salty about it.

202
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,700
That was his seat of honor.

203
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,850
He has the pride of a chess player, unwilling to ever admit defeat.

204
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,510
Besides, this is his most notable ability.

205
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,030
But just look at that scary glare he has.

206
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,670
Why does he always have to compete with you?

207
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,800
He is so persistent.

208
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,960
Persistence is a double-edged sword.

209

It can improve someone, but it can also lead one to a dead end.

Even though I've read the Book of Morality many times,

I've always been wondering, how to

implement this comprehension onto the GO game board.

216
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,170
But I haven't been able to think it through.

217
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,890
Perhaps I have my own persistence.

218
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,260
But once I put down the persistence,

219
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,110
it could be the moment when I complete the assignment from Master.

220

If you can't think it through, then don't think about it for now.

- What?
- Where did you get this money?

321
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,960
Let me tell you. Cheng Fengshou is so stingy that it's impossible that he'll pay you so much in wages.

322
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,690

- I...
- Think it through before you speak.

324
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,360
I borrowed it from a friend.

325
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,270
- Are you lying?
- I'm not lying.

326
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,680
Didn't you say I'm a dog if I lie?

327
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,720
I already said that you don't need to pay me back. Why do you still borrow from someone else?

328
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,640
I borrow and pay him back later, so I can borrow again.

329

You have so many connections, why don't you let your friend introduce you to a job?

I don't need it.

 (The Chinese title for "Skate Into Love" drama.)

Hurry and eat it, or it'll turn cold.

You can keep it to eat it yourself. I'm staying away from sugar.

Why?

344

I can't continue to disrupt your practice.

I made some desserts for you and put them in the fridge.

I also made some fruit tea for you.

351

When you play GO, you always forget to eat fruits.

So you must remember to replenish your Vitamin C.

It's not like Sister Cheng Liao is leaving and not returning.

360
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,830
Eight kilometers.

Do all show hosts fight so hard?

362
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,000
Can't help it. If you want to be liked by more people,

you have to work harder.

364

I'm not wasting time arguing with you.

You should hurry and go back to help Cheng Fengshou. Don't keep following me.

I'm not going. I'm still waiting for you to drink the Pear Stewed in Rock Sugar.

Sister, hold on just a bit more.

When you go back, you must massage your calf.

374

Even though a cramp isn't anything serious,

375

if you don't take care of it properly,

376

it won't be easy to recover.

377
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,630
Also, when you exercise in the future,

378
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,900
you must warm up thoroughly.

If your ligaments and muscles are injured, you'll be in big trouble.

00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,780
Why is everyone reacting like this?

478
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,670
Did he make a wrong move?

479
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,850
I just called the VP of Renming Hospital and other department heads.

480
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:43,240
They said Sheng Jingchu is probably having an allergic reaction.

481
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,370
- It's not a big deal.
- Allergy?

482
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,500
- Allergy meds.
- Thank you. You are the best.

483
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,850
But how do I give it to him?

484
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,940
I can't stop the game.

485
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,630
It depends on

486
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,330
if you guys can sense each other's minds.

487
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,110
The game has gotten to the most heated point. Even though Sheng Jingchu has the upper hand,

488
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,840
the two of them are like walking on the edge of a cliff.

489
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,950
One wrong move can draw the conclusion.

490
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,460
Sheng Jingchu's move is yet another surprising one.

491
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,890
AI suggested the black stone on the diagonal intersection.

492
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,360
If white counters with a tiger mouth, the black has a chain.

493
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,580
However, Sheng Jingchu did not choose to do that.

494
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,250
And here, I would like to say that GO has thousands of years of history,

495
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,210
and we are only looking at the tip of the iceberg, but AI is like the God looking over us.

496
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,020
Sheng Jingchu's bend gave Yao Ke an opportunity.

497
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,450
It might be where the situation changes.

498
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,600
If Sheng Jingchu loses, will Yao Ke find himself in this round

499
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,110
and have four consecutive losses and six consecutive wins

500
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,830
which is the greatest twist?

501
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,060
We might as well take a bold guess

502
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,550
what Yao Ke is thinking.

503
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,830
I was careless in my first game. Humans make mistakes.

504
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,100
But this round, you will repay me.

505
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,390
Come out now.

506
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,530
Stop the game.

507
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,840
Stop the game.

508
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:49,160
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

509
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,150
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

510
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:58,140
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

511
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,460
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

512
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,460
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

513
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,500
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

514
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,960
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

515
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,080
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

516
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,970
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

517
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:29,770
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

518
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,140
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

519
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:49,270
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

520
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:10,640
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

521
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,660
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

522
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,320
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

523
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,020
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

524
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,090
♫ There is color all around you ♫

525
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:31,030
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

526
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:36,380
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

527
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,690
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

528
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:53,310
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

529
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,390
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

530
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:03,420
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

531
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:09,600
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

532
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,370
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

533
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,320
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

534
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:25,140
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

535
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,870
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

536
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:44,650
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
