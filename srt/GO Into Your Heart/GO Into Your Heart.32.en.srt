00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,840
[Episode 32]

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,800
Sheng Jingchu,

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,290
let me ask you.

20
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,180
Do you see... everything else in black and white?

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,770
Only me in color?

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,040
When did it start?

23
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,080
The bus.

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,870
So...

25
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,840
after you started noticing me,

26
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,720
then you said you would only do an exclusive interview with me

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,320
and took me to Suzhou.

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,910
Did you do that all because of your psychologist's recommendation?

29
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,970
He did say that,

30
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,820
I should see you more often.

31
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,260
Then tell me.

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,530
When you say I'm special,

33
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,530
you like me very much,

34
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,140
you want to be with me for a long long time,

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,740
is it because you can see color through me?

36
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,290
No.

37
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,790
It wasn't like that later.

38
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,750
No.

39
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,390
Then why didn't you tell me?

40
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,020
I was afraid, afraid if I told you,

41
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,450
you'd ignore me and I'd never see you again.

42
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,340
I cannot see color. I'm scared.

43
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,060
So,

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,870
in your heart,

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,990
the color you've been searching twenty years for

46
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,100
is more important than I am.

47
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,390
Liao Liao.

48
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,740
Goddess Sister, I've been trying really hard already.

49
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,650
Can you love me a little bit?

50
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,860
Even if it's just a tiny little bit?

51
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,510
Okay?

52
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,110
No.

53
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,470
When our relationship slowly developed, it was more like a family.

54
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,990
As for love...

55
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,030
To start a relationship with love requires a split-second moment that triggers the heart.

56
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:48,130
Liao Liao, I missed you so much.

57
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,860
Why did you drink so much?

58
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,960
Sheng Jingchu,

59
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,450
let me ask you.

60
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,830
Master, I understand that fragmented memories can be really uncomfortable.

61
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,140
How about we drink a little for clarity

62
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,690
and retrieve all the forgotten memories?

63
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,970
Shut up!

64
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,870
What do we do then?

65
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,280
I remember now.

66
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,590
So, your colorblindness was caused by psychological reasons?

67
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,160
That's right.

68
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,510
That's why your only cure...

69
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,160
- is love.
- Master, you're unbelievable.

70
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,560
I can't believe even your love life is so unique.

71
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,710
That's ridiculous! Why didn't you tell her?

72
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,390
Deliberately hiding your flaw from your girlfriend, it's not because of a guilty conscience...

73
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,650
it is a guilty conscience!

74
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,380
Even I'm not suspecting that you purposely started using Sister Cheng Liao as a cure!

75
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,080
Stop talking.

76
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,360
Either way, I'm on Sister Cheng Liao's side this time. If she's upset, I'm upset too!

77
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,900
I swear I've never hidden anything from you.

78
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,580
Who knows for sure?

79
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,070
I...

80
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,340
Xiao Lan!

81
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,200
I really am an open book to you!

82
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,900
Master, you really are something.

83
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,820
If you would have told her sooner, there wouldn't be any misunderstanding now.

84
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,930
I had thought I wanted to tell her at the right moment.

85
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,760
Master, you're too naive.

86
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,470
In a relationship, the right moment is sooner rather than later.

87
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,250
That's right.

88
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,000
In the end, you'll understand all this through your tears.

89
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,930
For some people... For some people,

90
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,850
once the chance is gone... is gone.

91
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,430
Liao Liao.

92

Liao Liao.

93
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,820
I was wrong.

94
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,740
What did you do wrong?

95
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,170
Regarding the fact that I can see you in color.

96
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,600
I should have told you sooner.

97
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,790
Let me ask you one question, I'm only going to ask this once.

98
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,730
You need to answer me immediately.

99
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,660
Okay.

100
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,620
Do you actually like me

101
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,260
or do you like me because you see me in color?

102
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,740
Liao Liao!

103
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,240
Liao Liao, I'm too nervous. My brain was stuck earlier.

104
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,810
Can you give me another opportunity? Please ask me one more time?

105
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,150
You've really let me down.

106
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,940
Don't come here for the next few days. I want to be alone.

107
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,130
You let her go just like that?

108
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,830
Liao Liao said she wants to calm down.

109
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,870
Calm what down?

110
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,500
If she's calm, then you're out in the cold.

111
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,270
What should I do then?

112
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,390
This is all my fault.

113
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,880
It's not entirely your fault.

114
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,060
I should've told her sooner.

115
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,550
Master, I said this before.

116
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,570
If you have any problems with Liao Liao, I promise that I'll solve the problem with you.

117
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,430
Based on my extended experience, if you're looking for forgiveness from a girl,

118
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,740
there's only one word.

119

- Call her.

Okay, okay. Don't move! Don't move.

No one answering?

126
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,510
Keep pumping!

Okay! Okay! Don't move.

How is it? Still no one answering?

129
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,280
Find a rock.

130
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,990
- What do we need a rock for?
- To test the water.

131
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,540
Oh, okay.

132
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,720
We can kill people with this one. Get another one.

Master, it was all my fault.

Why don't you yell at me? Or hit me even.

141
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,950
If that doesn't work, I can carry a rattan switch and go admit my wrongs to Sister Cheng Liao and her father.

142
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,410
Stop causing trouble!

What do we do then?

144

There's only one way to go, which is to move Sister-in-Law so much

145
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
so that she'll let go of her anger.

No. That's ridiculous.

Senior Brother, are you sure you don't want to try it?

151
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,760

152

No.

Do you know?

These past few days,

281
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,810
I've been thinking a lot.

282
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,110
Even if I knew

283
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,820
that you...

284
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,010
you could see me in color so

285
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,500
that you noticed me...

286
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,750
and get close to me,

287

I still can't help but think about you.

I can't stop myself from thinking about all the sweet memories we had.

289
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:25,090
Because I know that those sweet,

290
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,340
warm memories can't lie to me.

291
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,130
This is what I think love should look like.

292
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,090
If I were, to be honest,

293
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,900
at least I...

294
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,560
really love you.

295

I really want to be with you forever.

296

However, the only thing I'm not sure of

297
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,750
is how true you are to me.

298
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,420
I tried to be calm and think about these things on my own,

299
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,300
but you just wouldn't give me the opportunity.

300

you're doing these things to make me happy,

306
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,570
but the only thing that will really

307
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,170
stop me from overthinking

308
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,900
isn't others, it's only you.

326
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,990
Not allowed.

327
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,350
What then? Just watching the two of them put on this endless drama?

328
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,910
Zhiliao is a big girl already. Let her deal with her own relationship problems.

329
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,210
Also, who doesn't fight in a relationship?

330
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,700
Fighting is another form of communication.

331
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,770
Look at all the theories you have, like you've had so many experiences.

332
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,510
You should bring one back for me to see.

333
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,140
It's fine to make a point, but why are you targeting me?

334
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,230
The one in a relationship makes me worry. The one that's not

335
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,220
makes me even more worried!

336
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,300
Senior Brother Jing,

337
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,990
I've heard about those things you guys did.

338
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,500
Cao Xihe told me what Sister Cheng Liao said as well.

339
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,350
You deserve it! Why can't you take a look at how those people are in their own love lives?

340
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,830
One of them changes outfits every day like he's got issues with his brain.

341
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,780
The other one is going after his goddess every day like he's going to die without her.

342
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,470
The last one is even worse.

343
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,800
He tells his feelings to a ten-year-old mobile phone that he's been holding onto.

344
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,860
Those three, the way they are, had the audacity to teach you and you had the audacity to listen to them?

345
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,020
I regret it a lot as well.

346
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,690
What do you plan to do now?

347
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,480
I'm not going to bother Liao Liao for now.

348
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,890
Senior Brother Jing!

349
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,920
You always know how to take advantage of the timing on the GO board.

350
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,520
Why are you such a fool when it comes to love?

351
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,270
Sister Cheng Liao said not to bother her and you had to bother her.

352
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,660
Now that she wants to see your true heart, you decide you don't want to bother her.

353
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,380
We are from the same hall, so here's a kind reminder.

354
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,520
If you keep doing this, you might never be able to get Sister Cheng Liao back.

355
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,360
I don't know what else to do. I don't know...

356
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,240
how to show my true heart to Liao Liao.

357
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,750
I'm scared that if I make any more mistakes,

358
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,440
she'll be even madder.

359
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,960
So you're just going to lock yourself at home all day?

360
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,710
If you can't think of anything, do you plan to not see her again?

361
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,490
Girls want to see your true heart.

362
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,260
True hearts lie in life's details.

363
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,190
When two people are interacting,

364
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,120
the small details usually don't seem to be much,

365
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,420
but when they pile up, they turn into a feeling.

366
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,030
You can't make up the feeling, and she also said, she doesn't deny the feelings you two have for each other.

367
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,890
However, you did hide the fact that you can see her in color.

368
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,390
She would naturally feel sad and have second thoughts.

369
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,440
So the thing you need to do most right now is to

370
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,800
show her exactly how you feel in the most sincere and honest way.

371
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,540
Give her enough security so she feels that she can keep doing this with you.

372
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,890
- Xiao Lan.
- Yeah?

373
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,220
I know what I should do now.

374
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,280
Could you do me a favor?

375
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Of course!

376
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,270
Hello, Miss He.

377
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,470
Editor Cheng.

378
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,710
I've already left Pinecone Video.

379
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,010
Just call me Cheng Liao.

380
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,840
Oh, okay Cheng Liao. I need to trouble you with something.

381
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,930
Tian Tian has been learning GO at Jiuzhou Hall lately, right?

382
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,800
I've heard about it from Senior Brother.

383
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,190
He said Tian Tian learns very fast and is really talented.

384
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,230
That's right. He's only been learning for a short time

385
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,000
and he already got first place in the Youth GO Competition.

386
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,030
He should be rewarded then.

387
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,590
That's what I was thinking too.

388
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,310
So I asked him what he wants for a present,

389
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,260
but he said the thing he wants the most

390
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,840
is for you and Mr. Sheng to take him to the film museum

391
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,880
to watch the documentary of GO masters.

392
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,240
I can do that. I have time.

393
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,280
How about... we forget about Sheng Jingchu?

394
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,280
You and I can take him.

395
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,440
Is Mr. Sheng too busy?

396
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,190
That's right. He doesn't have time.

397
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,510
All right then. I'll come to pick you up with Tian Tian tomorrow afternoon.

398
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,430
Okay. See you tomorrow.

399
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,370
See you tomorrow.

400
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,780
Now I can finally be alone.

401
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,140
- Hello.
- Miss He.

402
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,940
Sister Cheng Liao, I've been missing you.

403
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,820
I've missed you, too.

404
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,120
Mr. Sheng really doesn't have time today? I haven't seen him in a long time.

405
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,080
I miss him.

406
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,090
I'll keep you company for today,

407
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,360
when Mr. Sheng has time in the future,

408
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,570
I'll ask him to make it up to you. Okay?

409
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,190
I brought something tasty for you.

410
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,620
Hurry, take it.

411
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,990
In a bit, we can eat some snacks and sing some songs.

412
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:19,900
A happy trip to the film museum begins right now. Let's go!

413
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,350
- Let's go!
- This way. Our car is outside.

414
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,010
Okay.

415
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,280
Soul of the Sea.

416
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,920
It's about the navy.

417
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,610
A new biography of a veteran.

418
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,710
Yes.

419
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,600
What does this story tell?

420
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,690
We can watch it together next time.

421
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,750
Teacher He, the documentary is starting soon.

422
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,170
Should we go over there now?

423
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,310
Okay, Tian Tian, let's hurry and go.

424
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,580
Didn't you want to watch the documentary?

425
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,370
Take Sister Cheng Liao with us.

426
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,150
If I hadn't captured it at that time,

427
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,260
I would have been safe with about 20.

428
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,260
On December 18, 1988...

429
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,830
The hand holds a GO stone this way.

430
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:54,260
The middle finger is above and the index finger below.

431
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,920
Pinch the stone.

432
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,770
The fingers curve a little.

433
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,260
Looking at it from the side,

434
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,450
it looks like an eagle's beak. Try it.

435
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,110
It stopped what you thought...

436
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,430
Cheng Liao, Cheng Liao, you're really so weak. You're thinking about him again.

437
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,700
Sister Cheng Liao, are you thinking about Teacher Sheng?

438
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,100
No, I'm not thinking about him.

439

In my opinion, when I like someone,

462
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,790
it's not about the first sight or first look.

463
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,930
It's about everything we experience together

464
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,480
and the time, bit by bit to become familiar,

465

It truly is the beginning of how we met.

The world of color is indeed beautiful too,

but it's not enough to make me tell someone I dislike that I like them.

as long as you can stay by my side.

485
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,440
Liao Liao,

486
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,800
I love you.

487
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,940
♫ How do I get through each moment through the late night? ♫

488
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,790
♫ The city lights confuse me ♫

489
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,650
♫ The coffee in my hands has become cold ♫

490
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,950
♫ I hope you can refill it with warmth ♫

491
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:04,250
♫ The moment I think about you, I tremble all the time ♫

492
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,070
♫ There's no one like me ♫

493
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,850
♫ Who would go through fire and water for you ♫

494
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:16,510
♫ The only dedication ♫

495
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,490
♫ Accept that I'm sensitive and fragile ♫

496
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,250
♫ Redefining my principles ♫

497
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,100
♫ You want the moon and the galaxy ♫

498
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,970
♫ And peace of mind, all of it's okay ♫

499
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,680
♫ Give me another chance to be certain ♫

500
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,730
♫ Don't ever leave me, okay? ♫

501
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,350
Sister Cheng Liao. Teacher Sheng.

502
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,100
Are you finally back together?

503
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,310
Little devil, you actually secretly reported

504
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,610
and got together to deceive me.

505
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,100
Tell me. How should you be punished?

506
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,580
Cheng Liao, don't blame Tian Tian.

507
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:21,000
He was particularly upset when he heard that you and Mr. Sheng couldn't come together.

508
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,660
He insisted on making a phone call by himself. Once he called,

509
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,700
that's how he knew you and Mr. Sheng had some misunderstanding.

510
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,670
So we conveniently did a favor, a good deed.

511
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,070
Why fight? So childish.

512
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,670
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

513
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,660
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

514
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:18,150
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

515
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:21,830
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

516
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,990
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

517
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,840
That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

518
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,270
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

519
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,430
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

520
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:44,280
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

521
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,670
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

522
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,320
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

523
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:09,390
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

524
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

525
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,910
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

526
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:39,590
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

527
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:43,380
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

528
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,450
♫ There is color all around you ♫

529
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,290
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

530
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:55,080
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

531
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,010
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

532
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:13,740
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

533
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,780
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

534
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,670
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

535
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:29,740
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

536
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:33,690
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

537
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:39,660
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

538
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:45,040
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

539
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,990
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

540
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:06,190
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
