17
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,210
[Episode 40]

18
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,180
Master Ye, what are you doing here?

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,180
Don't leave.

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,980
I heard that you're retiring.

21
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,810
Who taught you to run away from your problems?

22
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,100
Did Xie Hanzhou teach you that?

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,130
I don't believe that.

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,770
Master raised me. He was like a parent to me.

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,120
But because of my stupidity,

26
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,740
Master can't even rest in peace after his death.

27
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,900
I'm unfilial.

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,090
I should leave.

29
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,020
Hanzhou and I were old friends for many years.

30
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,240
He groomed you all these years.

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,200
Even in the last game of his professional career, he had to play it with you.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,590
His life was complete only when the game was over.

33
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,880
You should understand his affection for you.

34
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,410
To let him rest in peace, you would even

35
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,230
give up your beloved GO.

36
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,450
That also explains your deep feelings for him.

37
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,400
If this is called discord between a master and disciple,

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,830
what does it mean to other people then?

39
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,160
Enemies in life and death?

40
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,040
I know that gossip is a fearful thing,

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,480
but gossip cannot get past those who are wise.

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,900
No matter what other people do, you yourself must remain clear-headed.

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,680
Your master never restricted himself to live his life in a certain way. He was righteous and open-minded.

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,980
He never cared about

45
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,020
other people's gossip and rumors.

46
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,130
Why are you so easily crushed then?

47
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,200
Stay. No matter what's ahead, defeat it.

48
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,140
Master Nie,

49
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,490
I don't think I can return to Jiuzhou Hall again.

50
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,500
Master's last will was to tell me to establish my own school.

51
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,580
I don't know why.

52
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,600
Life's decision-making is like playing GO.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,970
You sit in front of the GO board and fight alone.

54
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,300
Other than your own ideas and how you feel internally,

55
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,010
no one can tell you how to play.

56
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,190
He groomed you all these years.

57
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,220
Even in the last game of his professional career, he had to play it with you.

58
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,470
His life was complete only when the game was over.

59
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,970
You should understand his affection for you.

60
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,010
Senior Brother Jing, it's all a mess online now.

61
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,760
Come back.

62
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,910
Please don't abandon us, okay?

63
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,520
Master's last will was to tell me to establish my own school.

64
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,590
I don't know why.

65
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,860
You can't sleep? Let me warm up some milk for you.

66
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,760
Liao Liao.

67
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,240
Thank you.

68
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm hungry.

69
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,790
Just wait. I'll cook something for you.

70
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,120
Regarding the recent negative news about Jiuzhou Hall,

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,460
what do you think, and how will you respond?

72
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,650
Master just passed away.

73
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,480
Eldest Senior Brother's emotions were a little bit out of control.

74
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,070
It's understandable that he was a little too excessive in his behavior and language.

75
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:18,090
Actually, I hope people can understand how he was feeling at that time and give him some space.

76
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,770
What about Sheng Jingchu's disappearance?

77
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,820
After all, he was Master Xie's favorite disciple.

78
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,690
But he didn't even attend the farewell memorial. That doesn't seem proper.

79
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,640
About this, I came to Jiuzhou much later.

80
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,870
When it comes to the gratitude or grievances between him and Maser, I'm not all that clear about it.

81
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,970
But one thing is certain.

82
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,210
Master accepted me as a disciple.

83
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,070
Before his death, he also entrusted Jiuzhou Hall to me.

84
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,680
This means a lot.

85
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,960
What's passed is in the past, the living must cherish the time left.

86
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,130
I hope those negative comments regarding Jiuzhou Hall will stop now.

87
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,950
What exactly is the situation now?

88
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,090
Yao Ke is already representing Jiuzhou, accepting interviews with the media.

89
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,700
That's right. He won't even let us participate.

90
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,220
I really don't understand it.

91
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,580
What was Master thinking exactly?

92
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,980
Even if he wanted Senior Brother Jing to establish his own hall,

93
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,090
what about his biological son, our Eldest Senior Brother?

94
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,110
Jiuzhou Hall's ownership was also held by Eldest Senior Brother.

95
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,940
- If we're talking about who's next, it shouldn't be him!
- Enough.

96
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,210
No matter what,

97
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,490
it's Father's last will after all. Everyone heard it, didn't you?

98
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,640
Just let him be. He can do whatever he wants.

99
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,140
...coming to GO as a sport.

100
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,450
Therefore, for the next step, I'm—
- Mr. Sheng, we were planning to interview you

101
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,030
about all the negative comments regarding Jiuzhou Hall recently.

102
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,590
Mr. Reporter, at Jiuzhou Hall today,

103
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,720
we have some important internal matters to discuss.

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,650
We'll have the interview next time. Sorry.

105
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,830
Senior Brother Jing, you're finally back.

106
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,270
I came back to verify the truth.

107
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,200
The truth?

108
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,940
What do you mean?

109
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,340
I saw some of the news about the hall lately.

110
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,600
A lot of the content seems to be questionable.

111
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,340
Some of the news that's spreading out there

112
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,170
was only known to our insiders.

113
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,080
Such as?

114
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,030
Such as my sudden disappearance was to hide in my hometown.

115
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,950
Other than the people in the hall, no one else knew.

116
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,440
So, Jingchu, how do you plan to verify it?

117
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,330
It's simple. We're all GO players.

118
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,150
The GO board

119
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,330
is the best place to understand each other's thoughts.

120
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,190
Whether someone is guilty, feeling nervous,

121
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,680
or ashamed,

122
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,860
none of it can be hidden on the GO board.

123
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,960
I need to play against everyone.

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,630
This way, I can see

125
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,230
who got distracted

126
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,480
and lied.

127
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,530
Xiao Lan, your opening is so slow.

128
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,700
You're still fishing on the GO board.

129
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,650
This isn't your straightforward and decisive style.

130
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,230
Are you afraid that I can see

131
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,340
that you were talking too much out there?

132
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,940
You've already seen through it, let's not keep playing this round.

133
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,530
It's got me so nervous, I'll just be honest.

134
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,180
Some time ago, I indeed complained a little online

135
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,540
about the annoying stuff going on at Jiuzhou.

136
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,530
It probably was misinterpreted by some people,

137
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,370
but I can swear to Heaven that

138
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,090
- I've never said a bad word against Jiuzhou.
- I believe you.

139
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,520
This last move

140
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,110
certainly carried the determination, to tell the truth once and for all.

141
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,540
I was too talkative before.

142
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,870
I apologize to everyone.

143
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,790
Eldest Senior Brother, you're full of a fiery temper.

144
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,080
Jingchu, I don't have much to say to you.

145
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,770
Yes, I'm the one who got into it with the reporters which led to Jiuzhou being criticized.

146
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,340
At this very moment, I'm still the one who's angry with you.

147
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,270
If that's the reason that makes you suspect that I created rumors about you online, then I have nothing to say.

148
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,100
Eldest Senior Brother, that's not what I think.

149
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,780
But from your gestures and the sound when you place the stones,

150
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,490
it's not your usual style at all.

151
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,270
Compared to venting your anger on the GO board, what you really want to do is beat me up physically.

152
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,580
You're smart.

153
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,300
As for beating you... I really can't bear to.

154
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,520
But if you want me to forgive you... it won't be that easy.

155
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,460
You!

156
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,980
Go.

157
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,630
Xihe, your mind is a mess.

158
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,090
This formation has no logic at all.

159
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,370
When you're even making mistakes on basic formations, I think

160
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:22,120
you're targeting something beyond the GO board, right?

161
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,730
Cao Xihe, aren't you still not going to say the truth?

162
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,330
Okay.

163
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:39,430
I'll talk. The mess online is all my fault.

164
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,340
I shouldn't have lost control of myself and got into a shouting match online.

165
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:50,420
But they're really upsetting. When I saw what they were saying, my fire suddenly lit and I jumped in.

166
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:56,440
Even before I could think, the words clickety-clack got typed out and sent.

167
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,720
And then?

168
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,600
And then... it got worse and more intense and got into my head,

169
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,690
so they managed to get something on me.

170
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,960
They distributed the screenshots of my shouting match with them.

171
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,400
They said that our Jiuzhou Hall's

172
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,120
players are crude.

173
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,320
But, Senior Brother Jing, I know I did wrong.

174
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,370
I-I'm particularly remorseful when I saw what I posted before. I'm sorry, everyone.

175
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,750
Xihe, whatever you've done,

176
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,040
you have to take responsibility for.

177
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,860
Senior Brother, don't worry. I'll go online and apologize.

178
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,440
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,810
- What about Jiang Yuda?
- It's not necessary.

180
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,290
He's new and doesn't know anything.

181
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,300
You can all leave.

182
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,290
Junior Brother Yao Ke.

183
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,750
It's your turn.

184
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,610
We won't do the starting guess.

185
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,110
You're too unruly.

186
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,690
Are you lecturing me?

187
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,720
You indeed have the manner of a Master of Jiuzhou.

188
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,000
What? You don't want to play?

189
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,710
- I think it's a waste of time.
- You think you can't defeat me.
- I've beaten you before.

190
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,070
- That's because I changed my playing style and it wasn't fully formed yet.
- But I still defeated you.

191
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,070
And then you lost to Xie Chang'an,

192
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,380
- 3rd dan.
- Sheng Jingchu, you—

193
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,780
Come.

194
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,630
Let's play.

195
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,660
What?

196
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,340
You don't look convinced.

197
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,460
I've roughly counted it up.

198
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,820
In ten years, we played against each other 53 times, and I won 52 of them.

199
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,260
You lost 0 to 6 in the 10-Game GO match.

200
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,130
It was also you who initiated the challenge against me.

201
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,350
You nailed yourself on the pillar of shame, Yao Ke.

202
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,780
You're the laughingstock of the entire GO world right now.

203
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,140
Not yet done, are you?!

204
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,820
Actually, you're quite smart.

205
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,800
But you chose the wrong profession.

206
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,340
If you had been working in a steady manner in another field, perhaps you really could've accomplished something.

207
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,970
But you insisted on becoming a GO player.

208
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,150
I'm sorry then.

209
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,710
I'll always keep you under my foot.

210
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,090
Sheng Jingchu!

211
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,120
So what!

212
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,550
Right now in Jiuzhou Hall, I make the decisions! I'm in charge!

213
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,680
As long as I'm here,

214
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,520
you, Sheng Jingchu, will never take even one step inside.

215
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,390
- You want to ruin me like this?
- Yes!

216
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,470
I will ruin you!

217
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,100
I want you to know, even though you defeated me on the GO board,

218
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,310
I will ruin you outside of the GO board!

219
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,660
Jingchu,

220
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,960
how does it feel to be without a home? Does it hurt?

221
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,040
Let me tell you! It's not over yet.

222
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,410
I'll instigate the relationship between you and them.

223
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,470
I'll tell everyone

224
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,860
that you're someone who doesn't respect your opponents,

225
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,770
who isn't filial to Master, and a selfish bastard who's been deserted by everyone.

226
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,010
But I'm still the strongest GO player and you still can't defeat me.

227
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,840
Sure. But...

228
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,770
you're actually the biggest idiot.

229
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,900
Do you know something, Jingchu?

230
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,580
This hall should've originally been left to you.

231
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,410
But because you're too stupid, it was left to me.

232
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,550
I understand now.

233
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,630
Master never wanted to leave the hall to you.

234
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,500
He only mistook you for the wrong person.

235
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,360
That makes a little sense.

236
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,810
But it's too late for you to know that now.

237
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,580
At that time, everyone was there

238
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,060
and personally witnessed it.

239
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,730
Back then,

240
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,140
Master was afraid that I was too closed up and had me leave Jiuzhou to live outside.

241
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,230
Later, my eyes got well.

242
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,930
Master wanted me to return to Jiuzhou a long time ago.

243
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,840
He never thought to have me establish another school.

244
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,710
You've been spreading rumors everywhere. There's only one purpose.

245
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,010
It's to use the excuse that I didn't go to Master's memorial service

246
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,610
and Eldest Senior Brother losing control over his emotions, to provoke public opinion

247
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,930
and to make everyone think that Jiuzhou was unstable internally.

248
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,650
At this time, you stood up and pushed back the tide

249
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:37,890
to save Jiuzhou from me, a pitiful traitor.

250
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,740
You could ruin me

251
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,340
and also stand firmly at Jiuzhou.

252
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,630
Jingchu,

253
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,040
the person who laughs last

254
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,150
is me.

255
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,090
Yao Ke, the GO game isn't a lie detector.

256
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,870
Playing a game can't really reveal all the details.

257
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,740
But I'll still say the same thing.

258
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,260
When someone's done something against their conscience,

259
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,050
they'll mess up and leave traces of it.

260
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,330
Right from the start,

261
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,290
you didn't dare place even one single stone.

262
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,020
I'm actually not as smart as you think.

263
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,870
I was the same as the others,

264
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,650
was lost in the pain and suffering from Master's passing.

265
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,540
I felt nothing.

266
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,090
Luckily, someone called me out at the right time.

267
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,990
Jingchu, are you sure you want to strike out on your own?

268
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,100
I've never considered it before.

269
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,170
From what I remember, Old Xie had mentioned this to me multiple times.

270
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:33,410
He thought of you as the most appropriate heir. How could he let you go?

271
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,600
Does this sound like him?

272
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,100
This GO game is very famous.

273
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,060
Take a good look at it and you'll understand what I mean.

274
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,540
It's because of Master Nie's clues,

275
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,900
it cleared my head so I could see the truth behind everything.

276
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,170
When I slowly revisited all the details, you became suspicious.

277
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,390
It was me.

278
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
I did everything.

279
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,190
Master would never have you go out on your own.

280
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:27,510
I lied to you, and I lied to everybody. It was me.

281
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,340
I'm the one who wants to kick you out of Jiuzhou Hall.

282
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,350
Why?

283
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,310
Because I also want to be the best of the best.

284
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,020
Tell you the truth, I don't want to take over this Hall at all.

285
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,150
All I want to do is to ruin you.

286
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,400
Who do you think you are?

287
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,790
Why do I have to live under your, Sheng Jingchu's shadow...

288
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,870
my entire life? Why?

289
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,860
All I want is to get rid of you.

290
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,540
I want to use public opinion to destroy you.

291
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
So in this entire lifetime, you'll never be able to come back!

292
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,370
You're crazy!

293
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,520
That's right! I'm crazy. You're the one who drove me mad!

294
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,080
At this point, I might as well tell you everything.

295
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,200
Everything I did... Everything, all of it,

296
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,360
the entire thing was to go against you. Including Yang Xiaoyu's father?

297
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,630
And that other thing? I did that.

298
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,550
My only regret was why did I become so soft-hearted at that time?

299
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:27,990
I only regret not letting him destroy you completely!

300
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,950
Fortunately, you've said all of this now.

301
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,460
If you had really sat down and started to play GO with me,

302
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,630
I'm afraid I wouldn't have heard any of this in my lifetime. As for them...

303
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,210
they were just acting.

304
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:06,180
Senior Brother Jing, you're saying Yao Ke is behind all this turmoil?

305
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,190
That's my guess.

306
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,740
The only way to know the truth is for him to admit to them himself.

307
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,320
Tell us! What do you want us to do?

308
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,020
Play a GO game.

309
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,650
Yao Ke,

310
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,430
I can no longer play GO anymore.

311
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,640
What?

312
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,880
You can no longer play GO?

313
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,720
Mr. Yao, was everything you said true? Mr. Yao...

314
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,940
- What are you still here?
- ...can you answer our questions?

315
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,300
Stop shooting, stop shooting. Stop shooting! Beat it!

316
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,200
Mr. Yao, can you answer my question?

317
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,770
How was it?

318
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,960
I didn't know Junior Brother Yao Ke would be that kind of person.

319
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,140
I even called him Junior Brother.

320
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,390
I've done what I was supposed to do.

321
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,580
Jingchu, you can't leave.

322
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:16,250
Before, you were always the star player of Jiuzhou Hall... From now on, you still are.

323
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,870
No matter what, you can't go.

324
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,810
If a professional GO player can no longer play GO,

325
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,760
what's the point of them staying at Jiuzhou Hall?

326
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,850
Senior Brother Jing!

327
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,580
A few days ago, renowned GO player Yao Ke 9th dan was revealed as the person

328
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,080
who instigated a third-party attack on his fellow Jiuzhou Hall brother, Sheng Jingchu 9th dan,

329
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,850
causing injury to his girlfriend. He also spread rumors and fake news online.

330
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,400
The Public Security Bureau has decided to charge Yao Ke and Yao Pu

331
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,750
with five days of administrative detention.

332
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,970
It's caused significant negative impact to the Binhai GO Academy.

333
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,720
Therefore, they've decided to ban Yao Ke, 9th dan, for the rest of his life.

334
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,750
[Kind Father, Xie Hanzhou]

335
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,560
Master,

336
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,950
I'm sorry.

337
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,160
It took me a long time to come and visit you.

338
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,510
I was too cowardly before.

339
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,480
I didn't even have the courage to say goodbye to you.

340
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,550
I can't believe it...

341
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,220
that in the end, you still taught me another lesson.

342
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,880
Don't worry,

343
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,890
things at Jiuzhou Hall have all been taken care of.

344
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,630
Before I came here,

345
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,610
Liao Liao specifically reminded me...

346
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,260
not to shed any tears.

347
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,850
I can't give you any more stress.

348
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,010
So today,

349
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,930
I'll spend some time chatting with you,

350
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,490
and have a few drinks.

351
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,760
[Kind Father]

352
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:47,620
You've been with Sheng Jingchu a lot lately, you must be exhausted.

353
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,000
Zhiliao, what's wrong?

354
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,030
I'm really upset.

355
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,710
Sheng Jingchu has already resolved the matters at Jiuzhou Hall, hasn't he?

356
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,500
But he hasn't emerged from his sorrow at all.

357
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,900
He still can't play GO.

358
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,180
I don't know how to persuade him at all.

359
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:27,740
I'm afraid to accidentally say something that might give him too much pressure.

360
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,490
Sis, I've never been as lost as I am right now.

361
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,210
Zhiliao.

362
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,470
Sheng Jingchu lost both of his parents when he was young.

363
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,630
Master Xie brought him up.

364
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,660
To him, Master Xie

365
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,630
was his closest family member. Right?

366
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,760
The feeling of losing a family member,

367
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,220
is something we've both experienced before.

368
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,520
Do you still remember when our mother just passed away?

369
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,010
You were so little.

370
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,160
You'd pick up a stool with your tiny body every day

371
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,120
and stand on the balcony,

372
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,150
leaning on the window, waiting, watching,

373
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,320
seeing when our mom would come back.

374
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,760
Extremely stubborn, no matter what we said, you'd refuse to listen.

375
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,250
At that moment, I realized,

376
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,720
no matter what I said, it wouldn't make you feel better.

377
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,270
The only thing I could do

378
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,110
was to keep you company every day.

379
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,810
Wait for Mom together on the balcony.

380
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,010
At this time,

381
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:06,650
companionship is more effective than words.

382
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,630
Don't rush.

383
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,840
Give Sheng Jingchu some time.

384
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,730
Let him walk out of this slowly.

385
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,540
I believe that

386
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,120
you'll definitely accompany him and help him get through this difficulty.

387
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,470
Actually, everyone is really anxious about what's going on with Master.

388
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,480
I'll go to the hall in a bit to discuss with everyone what to do.

389
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,130
I thought about it all night yesterday.

390
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:39,710
I thought about it over and over, and there may be one thing that would work.

391
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,640
That's to revitalize Jiuzhou Hall.

392
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,530
Do you mean to use the Hall to distract Sheng Jingchu?

393
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,020
It's not just to distract him.

394
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,440
Jiuzhou Hall is Grand Master's life's work.

395
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,100
To Master, it's like Grand Master

396
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,550
is still alive in a different way.

397
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,200
If Jiuzhou Hall can be revived again, back to its previous vitality,

398
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,430
and become even better,

399
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,570
perhaps Master would also regain a new life then.

400
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,220
If it's really like that,

401
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,600
this method could work.

402
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,150
Yuda, both of these two paths carry risks.

403
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,680
If we establish a club, the sponsors can easily withdraw funding.

404
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,620
But a traditional hall would rely on Master and disciples to support it with competition prize money.

405
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
Many eventually can't sustain themselves.

406
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,160
What this means is there is no good path.

407
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,170
Regardless of the choice, what we rely on ultimately is still thoughtful management and maintenance.

408
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,130
It's nothing.

409
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,900
I'm 120% confident in Master and all you elders.

410
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,990
What's the use even if you are that confident?

411
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,660
It's not easy to establish a club.

412
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,040
It takes money and also resources.

413
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,710
And I thought there was something more difficult than that.

414
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,650
I can solve all of that.

415
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,760
How about we go to other clubs

416
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,590
or halls to ask if they can recommend someone they know?

417
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,830
- Junior Sister—
- With Jiuzhou's fame,

418
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,760
it shouldn't be hard to get a few sponsors. Right?

419
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,320
- Senior Uncle, listen to me—
- But how can we ensure quality and a solid background?

420
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,410
We're just GO players, we don't understand how to commercialize something.

421
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,650
Let's not arbitrarily do anything and cause problems.

422
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,080
- That—
- But I think Eldest Senior Brother is still stronger than us when it comes to this.

423
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,510
I mean really. Why don't you all believe me?

424
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,020
Xu Chi, Cheng Yi is my girlfriend already.

425
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,680
I know that your confession was successful. Sit down first.

426
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,390
Sit.

427
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:03,340
I just felt that there were some things we should talk about face to face.

428
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,670
What about?

429
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,010
Xiao Yi, actually, when I originally kept you at Binhai

430
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,760
and had you come work for Pinecone Video,

431
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,960
I wasn't just helping a friend as I said at the time.

432
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,320
I had my own selfish reasons at that time.

433
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,340
I used to think that it was only because of distance

434
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,790
that your impression of me was like it was when we were kids, like a buddy.

435
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,950
As long as I kept you by my side, working together day and night,

436
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,840
I thought sooner or later you would see how I had changed and start to like me.

437
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,510
Xu Chi. See?

438
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,970
- I knew you had ill intentions.
- Jiang Yuda.

439
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,830
Don't talk anymore.

440
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,990
- Go ahead, keep talking.
- I finally realized it last night.

441
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,730
I would never be able to get you.

442
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,120
This wasn't a problem that could be solved by time or distance.

443
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,040
I used to think that I understood you best because we grew up together.

444
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,320
As long as I worked hard to become what you wanted,

445
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,060
we would be together eventually.

446
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,080
But I understand it now.

447
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,740
Love seems to have nothing to do with those things.

448
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,350
This is how love really hurts.

449
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,870
It's also because of that, love becomes rare

450
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,060
and precious, isn't that right?

451
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,110
Brother,

452
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,070
I...

453
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,250
I don't know what to say.

454
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,270
Anyway, love isn't something that can be easily explained.

455
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,800
Regarding love, you're indeed the one who was hurt.

456
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,060
But previously, I also told you that it's all fair in love.

457
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,170
But you're so outstanding,

458
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,840
you'll definitely find the right person in the future.

459
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,890
Actually, I asked the two of you to come today because I wanted to formally tell Xiao Yi something.

460
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,180
This time, without concealing anything,

461
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,270
I'm completely stepping back to be a good friend.

462
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,920
I sincerely congratulate you that you've finally found the love that belongs to you.

463
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,320
Old Xu, you'll always be my best buddy.

464
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,550
And you, unabashedly shameless and unafraid to work hard,

465
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,280
you've finally got your goddess sister.

466
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,060
Thank you.

467
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,360
But I have to warn you. From now on, I'm Xiao Yi's own family.

468
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,920
If you dare make her suffer even just a little or mistreat her, I absolutely won't let you go.

469
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,530
Don't worry, Brother.

470
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,070
I'll definitely take good care of her and never let her get hurt.

471
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,580
Look at how the two of you are talking. Am I that weak?

472
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,690
Shall we go to the boxing gym and try a few moves?

473
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,190
Enough now. This restaurant's red wine and steak are particularly good.

474
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,290
I've already pre-ordered for you.

475
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,170
Consider it as my celebratory gift to you two.

476
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,590
Take your time to enjoy. I'll be going.

477
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,340
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Old Xu.

478
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,370
I'm off then.

479
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,820
Even though I was prepared mentally in advance,

480
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,580
but when I saw the mess in the hall,

481
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,810
I still felt really bad.

482
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,600
Liao Liao,

483
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,330
it's all my fault. if I hadn't run away for such a long time,

484
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,680
they wouldn't have wilted.

485
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,070
Don't blame yourself too much.

486
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,820
Just be like how you were today, face it bravely,

487
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,680
and everything will get better.

488
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,620
As long as we take good care of these flowers,

489
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,690
water them, prune them,

490
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,020
they will definitely grow back to be even more beautiful than before.

491
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,620
Believe me.

492
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,960
♫ The world suddenly became calm ♫

493
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,620
♫ You walked past me ♫

494
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,730
♫ Disappearing quietly, ♫

495
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,320
♫ Your back only a silhouette ♫

496
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,130
♫ Falling into your eyes ♫

497
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,870
♫ Nowhere to hide from the longing ♫

498
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:41,720
♫ Waiting for that moment when the wind blows,  ♫

499
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,900
♫  Bringing something to place your hope on ♫

500
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,900
♫ Please forgive my weaknesses ♫

501
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,620
♫ For cowering over and over again ♫

502
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,940
♫ Missing it over and over again ♫

503
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,970
♫ I pretend to be lonely and sad ♫

504
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:08,790
♫ How do get through each moment through the late night? ♫

505
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,740
♫ The city lights confuse me ♫

506
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,480
♫ The coffee in my hands has become cold ♫

507
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,260
♫ I hope you can refill it with warmth ♫

508
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,440
Look. These flowers are alive again.

509
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,700
♫ There's no one like me ♫

510
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,510
Liao Liao,

511
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,690
can I be revived like them?

512
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,730
I believe in you.

513
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:19,340
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

514
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,150
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

515
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,990
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

516
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,550
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

517
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,530
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

518
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,490
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

519
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,920
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

520
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,120
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

521
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:54,010
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

522
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,910
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

523
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,080
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

524
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:19,290
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

525
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:40,720
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

526
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,750
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

527
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:49,230
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

528
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,070
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

529
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:57,030
♫ There is color all around you ♫

530
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,940
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

531
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:05,650
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

532
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:13,720
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

533
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:23,180
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

534
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,550
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

535
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:33,510
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

536
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:39,410
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

537
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,370
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

538
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:49,270
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

539
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:55,300
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

540
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,270
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

541
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:15,010
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
