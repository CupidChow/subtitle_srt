00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,400
♫ That line from the bottom of my heart. Nice to meet you ♫

164
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,200
♫ The confession is in your eyes,
almost bumped into you completely ♫

165
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,700
♫ Can you already tell?  ♫

166
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,400
Are these enough?

167
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,800
They are plenty.

168
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,000
But we don't have to eat here. I'll take you to a better place.

169
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Okay.

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,400
How about it? Isn't it good?

171
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,000
Our school is the kind that won't allow food being taken in.

172
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But the food stalls are right next to the school.

173
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How could I stand it?

174
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
I would go buy some during a break.

175
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,400
But the school's front entrance was here, and the food stalls were there.

176
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,800
Going there and back would waste too much time.

177
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,300
So my little head thought, "Between two points,

178
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,800
a straight line was the shortest."

179
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,800
You really got used to climbing over a wall.

180
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,900
Let me tell you. Climbing over a wall can not only get delicious food,

181
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,700
it can also let you enjoy great scenery.

182
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
Isn't it worth it?

183
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,500
When you mention climbing over the wall now,

184
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,980
are you still sad?

185
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,800
I can't say it's really sad,

186
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,400
but it's not happy either.

187
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,800
It's getting pretty late, let's go.

188
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,400
Wait.

189
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,100
Just five more minutes. Since it's almost midnight,

190

It's so inexplicable that I got kissed twice.

00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,560
When there is such a face sitting in front of you, who still cares about winning the game?

319
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,090
Open the umbrella.

320
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:32,570
I must defeat you this time, Jo Yeon Hoon.

321
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,450
How is it so coincidental?

322
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,320
So, you planned it long ago.

323
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,140
Planning what?

324
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,730
You are clearly pursuing Cheng Yi, yet you even found a chance to accidentally meet me and become friends.

325
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,490
No, Brother, you are the one who asked me to stay to eat when we first met. Right?

326
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,580
Who could have imagined that the two people who were cheering each other

327
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,160
actually end up liking the same person.

328
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,560
You should withdraw.

329
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,510
Do you know how negatively her drunken photo has affected her?

330
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,080
The funding for her new program was withdrawn and her new interviews were canceled.

331
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,420
She could have won an easy victory with this program.

332
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,740
Yet, you ruined her plan totally.

333
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,600
How can one photo ruin her?

334
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,020
What did we do?

335
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,540
An unmarried man and an unmarried woman, so what that we were drinking together?

336
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,740
Who hasn't been drunk before?

337
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,190
Aren't those keyboard warriors and anti-fans interfering too much?

338
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,110
Why don't you feel guilty at all?

339
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,510
I don't feel guilty! Not only that I don't feel guilty, I even feel angry!

340
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,570
I want to stand by her side, knock down those online trolls. Whoever doesn't accept it, just come at me.

341
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,900
Don't bully my goddess.

342
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,460
Are you going to continue to make a fuss?

343
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,070
Brother, I'm a free person.

344
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,630
I have my human rights.

345
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,960
Whatever I want to do, it's my own business.

346
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,930
You can't interfere.

347
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,460
But since things have gotten to this point,

348
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,820
it looks like we can't be brothers anymore.

349
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,240
Thank you for inviting me to drink wine.

350
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,970
I won't return the favor.

351
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:39,840
Mr. Zhang, after the incident occurred, may I ask why you didn't undertake effective communication?

352
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,570
Why do you care? It's an internal affair within my company. Quit asking.

353
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,390
Mr. Zhang, can we have a chat?

354
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,300
Don't keep following me.

355
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,900
- Mr. Zhang, it will only take a few minutes of your time.
- Go away!

356
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,840
No, Cheng Yi. You are a famous person after all.

357
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,520
There's a fire in your own backyard, but you are here to interview me?

358
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,370
You are a famous anchor hugging a young boy and drinking.

359
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,420
Aren't you embarrassed? Aren't you embarrassed?

360
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,060
Sister, are you okay?

361
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,410
Why are you here?

362
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,720
Was I wrong? You are inseparable like a person and her shadow.

363
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,990
How dare you push my goddess? I'm fighting with you!

364
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,350
- Just wait.
- I'm not waiting for you.

365
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,870
Besides, you took the initiative to push my sister goddess.

366
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,480
That's right. We filmed it all.

367
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,500
Sister, are you okay?

368
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,110
How did you find me here?

369
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,120
I called the TV station. They said that you were interviewing nearby.

370
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,320
It's lucky that I came in time. Otherwise that guy...

371
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,960
Right.

372
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,980
Can you quit being a busybody? I really don't want to make more trouble.

373
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,260
When you talk, why do you sound just like Xu Chi?

374
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,370
How do you know Xu Chi?

375
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,670
It's a long story. We are acquaintances.

376
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,460
Besides, we've already talked in the open.

377
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,700
We'll compete fairly.

378
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,410
Why compete? What is there to compete for? I'm not your private property.

379
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,960
Between romantic rivals, there is naturally a competition.

380
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,140
Have you two ever asked my opinion?

381
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,940
He is like family to me. What about you?

382
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,150
I'm just sympathizing with you.

383
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,710
What if...

384
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,510
sympathy turns into love?

385
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,400
Enough of that. I'm annoyed too much already.

386
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,310
You should quit making trouble.

387
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,340
I know that you don't live an easy life.

388
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,540
It's hard enough. Think about proper things to do. Learn GO well.

389
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,110
Don't forget why you came back.

390
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,820
Sister,

391
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,880
I love you.

392
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,740
Junior Sister, turn a bit then get close. May get you near,

393
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,090
but black turns and switches with white. No damage is done.

394
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,800
The black defender isn't satisfied.

395
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,950
Then what should you do?

396
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,100
Look at the third step.

397
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,380
First creep (into the opponents area) then, pinch (them between your two pieces).

398
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,040
If white (coming from their own area) rushes (at black's empty area), black can take advantage by parting white (into 2 different white areas).

399
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,640
If white connects, black parts first. Then go right or left.

400
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,360
What a brilliant combination move.

401
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,690
Not bad, Junior Brother, you're pretty good.

402
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:38,010
Junior Brother, between you and Jo Yeon Hoon, who's strategy is better?

403
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,440
- I think–
- Don't mention him again.

404
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,010
- What's wrong with Jo Yeon Hoon?
- I just don't like to hear the name.

405
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,220
Jo Yeon Hoon. Yeon Hoon-oppa.

406
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,170
- Yeon Hoon-oppa is my god.
- Xiao Lan, you're going overboard.

407
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,530
What are you being mean for?

408
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,480
- Senior Brother.
- Xiao Lan,

409
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,770
your favorite mangos.

410
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,370
Here, let's eat and discuss it.

411
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,800
Thanks, Senior Brother.

412
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,160
Master already decided not to attend the Four Countries Tournament.

413
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,800
Firstly, because all the competitors are his juniors.

414
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,230
Secondly, you're all aware that father isn't interested in this type of business competition.

415
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,260
Although he isn't participating, we need to do all the pre-competition preparations.

416
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,070
We need to understand and be up to date with how our competitors are doing.

417
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,300
Xiao Lan, this year you got the special invite as a female player.

418
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,270
Don't stress yourself out. Relax.

419
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,100
Thank you, Senior Brother.

420
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,420
Senior Brother, since Master isn't here,

421
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,640
why don't you share with us?

422
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,960
All right.

423
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,380
Let me share my thoughts.

424
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,030
- First, we must–
- I think the most important is

425
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,000
to not let Cao Xihe run into Jo Yeon Hoon.

426
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,040
When he runs into my Yeon Hoon-oppa,

427
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,010
he becomes numb and dizzy.

428
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,790
This is all decided by luck of the draw.

429
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,320
- I think–
- I think that my meeting Jo Yeon Hoon

430
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,030
is better than Ding Lan meeting him.

431
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,450
Between that Zhao guy and me, we still don't know who'll win or lose.

432
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,310
If Ding Lan plays him,

433
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:19,670
she'll only look at the face and not the game. Not only will she lose the game, but she'll also embarrass Jiuzhou Hall.

434
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,380
Who said I don't pay attention to the game?

435
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,680
Plus, I like to look at handsome men. How is that embarrassing?

436
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,910
Slow down, slow down. When playing GO, you should still watch the game,

437
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,860
not the handsome guys. For example, if you like to look at handsome guys,

438
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,890
you can look before the competition.

439
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,770
Xihe is pretty handsome, too.

440
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,230
You can look at him, right?

441
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,750
Right, Junior Brother?

442
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,790
Let's just stick to discussing the competition.

443
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,800
All right, then let's talk about Jo Yeon Hoon.

444
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,300
I-I meant to say, every player has his own habits.

445
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,350
These habits can be weaknesses.

446
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:59,140
For example, Jingchu. His habit is to hold The Book of Morality, right?

447
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,550
He flips through it before the competition and leaves it by his hands during the competition.

448
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,170
Otherwise, he'll feel uneasy.

449
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,960
Why does Senior Brother Jingchu always bring it?

450
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,110
Father actually gave him the book

451
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,090
when he was young. After all these years, he's used to having it.

452
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,530
That way, he can feel at ease.

453
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,790
Let me tell you. My Yeon Hoon-oppa is like that too.

454
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,990
My Yeon Hoon-oppa has a tiger-head peach wood amulet.

455
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,560
My Yeon Hoon-oppa always has it with him during competitions.

456
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,380
I heard my Yeon Hoon-oppa's Master gave it to my Yanxun-oppa.

457
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,300
My Yeon Hoon-oppa has always been serious about GO.

458
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,370
Let me tell you. My Yeon Hoon-oppa only cried once during an interview.

459
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,890
It was when my Yeon Hoon-oppa...

460
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,340
My Yeon Hoon-oppa had a weak body when he was young,

461
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,270
but playing GO also requires physical strength.

462
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,980
At that time, my Yeon Hoon-oppa started working out

463
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,260
just to play GO.

464
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,360
[GO Friends, GO Classroom]

465
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,240
Is GO too difficult

466
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,530
or am I not smart enough?

467
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,520
I'm not an expert. I won't be able to make the program good.

468
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,350
My disappointing brain,

469
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,670
why do I still think about that?

470
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:34,200
God, don't get mad. I didn't mean to offend you.

471
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,990
It's not that I have bad intentions.

472
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:40,420
At this point, I can only beg you to save me.

473
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,250
[God, the GO competition is right around the corner,]

474
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,640
[but I really don't know enough about GO.]

475
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,580
[Can I be a last-minute apprentice of yours to learn a thing or two?]

476
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,540
[I'm home. You can come over.]

477
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,890
[Okay.]

478
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,140
Hello, Teacher.

479
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,720
Hello, Classmate Cheng. Come in.

480
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,150
[History of GO]

481
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,850
You've prepared everything?

482
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,660
I'm a teacher. It's better to take it seriously.

483
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,200
While you were on your way, I took some screenshots from online.

484
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,640
That way, it'll be easier for you to learn.

485
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,730
A god is a god. So fast even in preparing the material.

486
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,950
Ready?

487
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,850
Replying to the teacher, I'm ready.

488
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,740
Let's start class.

489
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,180
What's wrong?

490
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,000
I thought it would be like school with you teaching at the front.

491
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,070
Then pretend I'm a private tutor.

492
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:28,290
There will be players from the Four Countries Tournament at the competition.

493
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:33,190
Those are China, Korea, Japan, and Singapore. I'll start by

494
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,830
talking about the GO history and development in these countries.

495
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,020
Then I'll talk about the players.

496
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,550
Okay, whatever you say.

497
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,900
The origin of GO is China.

498
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,420
Legends say Yao created GO

499
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
to educate his son, Danzhu.

500
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,570
GO came from the imitating of military strategy

501
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,090
to self-cultivation activities,

502
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,980
and then was redeveloped into a competitive sport for money.

503
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,800
In the game of the century between humans vs. computers,

504
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,040
this was humans only win.

505
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:31,900
The key was this tactic, "Bore." It was the turn of the game.
(TN: When the opponent is trying to achieve a single duo piece line up, bore in between the piece.)

506
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,250
- Did you get all of that?
- Yes.

507
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,420
Then let's take a break.

508
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,010
I'll go take a look at the greenhouse.

509
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,430
Okay.

510
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:37,170
♫ The wind blows,
The moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

511
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:41,100
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

512
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,890
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

513
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,510
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

514
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,420
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

515
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,420
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

516
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,840
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

517
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,940
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

518
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,910
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

519
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:17,490
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

520
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,780
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

521
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:36,310
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me

522
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:58,510
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

523
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:02,680
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

524
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,080
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

525
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,010
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

526
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:14,800
♫ There is color all around you ♫

527
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,820
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

528
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,420
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

529
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,980
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

530
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:41,280
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

531
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,230
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

532
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:51,300
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

533
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:57,110
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

534
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:01,220
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

535
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:07,200
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

536
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,340
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

537
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,240
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

538
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:32,820
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
