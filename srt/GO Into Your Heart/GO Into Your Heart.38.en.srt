[Episode 38]

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,330
Today, at the China-Korea Invitational GO Tournament, in the game between Xie Hanzhou 9th dan and Sheng Jingchu 9th dan,

19
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,450
the high-profile battle between master and disciple came to an end.

20
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,210
In the end, after having tied for the first two games with the score of 1:1,

21
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,290
Sheng Jingchu won the final round and became the champion.

22
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,200
Look, Master.

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,140
Even if it's aggressive to put it in this corner,

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,170
it's still too risky.

25
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,260
If you let the black stone come out here,

26
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,370
it can cause unnecessary conflict.

27
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,690
Unlike this large knight move.

28
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,100
It blocks off this point

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,150
and covers a large area here.

30
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,710
One of the two is guaranteed, from the left and to the right.

31
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,850
Plus...

32
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,310
the advantage accumulated from the first half, it's a smooth transition.

33
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,110
This way, it's a guaranteed win.

34
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,630
Well done.

35
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,500
Why didn't I think of this reverse strategy?

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,430
Jingchu, your GO skills have improved a lot.

37
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,640
Also, it's more comprehensive now.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,030
Look, no matter if it's a majestic, imposing move,

39
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,780
or a balanced, skillful play,

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,560
you can handle them all.

41
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,850
Thank you for your praise, Master.

42
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,780
I've never seen someone this happy doing the post-game analysis after losing.

43
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,720
It means that compared to some titles of champion,

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,790
he loves his beloved disciple more.

45
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,530
Don't say that.

46
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,440
It's not that Master prefers one over another.

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,970
I believe if I won, Master would be just as happy.

48
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,770
- Of course.
- Right?

49
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,500
The question is, can you beat him?

50
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,120
Senior Brother, what you just said sounds so—

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,370
There's still logic to what he said.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,700
That's right. That's right. I thought the same, too.

53
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,420
Lan Lan, do you think Senior Brother Jing and Master

54
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,240
won't end any time soon, right?

55
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,330
What do you mean?

56
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,700
I have to treat you two to lunch again, is that it?

57
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,760
Someone who's always losing at GO?

58
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,760
You're a second-generation GO player.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,130
You're not wrong.

60
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,710
- Let's go?
- Yay!

61
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,320
This way we can bring some takeout back for Senior Brother Jing and Master.

62
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,590
Let's not pack takeout for them. They're already winners. Do they need to takeout?

63
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,660
That's right.

The Taste of Memories made us cry so hard!

69

They turned out to be Senior Brother's fans!

73
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,760
I had thought he was going to die alone.

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,130
It looks like he can give love a go again in this stage of life.

75
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,300
Seeing Eldest Senior Brother this famous, do you feel a sense of loss?

76
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,900
No need to rush. No need to rush.

77
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,550
Wanting to be famous was a childish wish I had for years.

78

Now that I have you, you're enough for me.

this one dan is very meaningful.

I'm confident in myself.

Then, Master, could you share some of your confidence with me?

99

- For what?
- After receiving the award, I have something really important to do,

100
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,560
which requires enough confidence and courage. In fact, the more the better.

In the past, I set so many harsh conditions.

But Brother Xu Chi has been very persistent with you.

If I reluctantly agreed to be with him because of his persistence,

then I'd suffer every day after that.

146

He'd definitely be able to tell that I wasn't happy.

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,740
Hurry up, go check it. Stay close.

318
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:35,910
♪ Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. ♪

319
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,520
I know there's still a few hours until your birthday,

320
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,950
but I hereby represent everyone

321
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,170
to wish our New Year's baby, Sheng Jingchu,

322
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,940
- a happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

323
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,790
Master, hurry to make a wish and blow the candles out.

324
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,650
- I wish—
- You can't say it out loud!

325
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,860
It won't work if you say it out loud.

326
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,890
Thank you, everyone.

327
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,260
Take a seat. Take a seat.

328
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,050
It was all Sister Cheng Liao's hard work.

329
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,100
From the cake to this whole table of food,

330
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,020
she made them all by herself for you.

331
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,290
Master. Senior brothers.

332
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,640
Can we eat now? I'm so hungry.

333
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,690
Is that all you've got?

334
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,820
You should always let your master take the first bite,

335
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,770
no matter how delicious they are.

336
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,230
- Right, right.
- Eat, eat then.

337
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,220
It tastes great. Really great.

338
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,380
Mr. Xie, and everyone,

339
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,350
as Cheng Liao's family,

340
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,830
today I'm really honored

341
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,840
to be part of the Jiuzhou Hall family

342
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,930
to celebrate the New Year and Sheng Jingchu's birthday.

343
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,840
I'm very thankful for your support and care

344
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,070
for my sister, Cheng Liao, over the past year.

345
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,080
And I really hope we'll all have a better year ahead of us.

346
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,290
Happy birthday, Sheng Jingchu.

347
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,260
Happy New Year, everyone.

348
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,700
Happy New Year!

349
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,440
Happy New Year!

350
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,030
- Wait!
- What now?

351
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,310
It's such a good day today.

352
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,680
I'd like to announce something as well.

353
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,790
Someone else should hear this, too.

354
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,450
Uncle Cheng.

355
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,600
- Hello, Xiao Dada? 
- Hello.

356
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,630
Hey, Uncle Cheng, we're having dinner together.

357
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,890
It's a great day today,

358
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,910
and I'm here to announce something very important to everyone.

359
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,810
Which is, your daughter,

360
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,900
my goddess sister, Cheng Yi,

361
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,550
finally agreed to be with me!

362
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,620
- We saw it on the internet already.
- That's right.

363
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,720
Uncle Cheng, they were kissing passionately on the street!

364
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,890
I was so jealous that it made me want to be in a relationship!

365
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,350
What? When was that?

366
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,150
Xiao Yi, why didn't you tell me?

367
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,210
Zhiliao, you didn't tell me either.

368
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,080
Xiao Dada, you were so quick.

369
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,450
How dare you do that to my daughter behind my back. I won't let you off easy!

370
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,370
Don't think you've passed the test just because Xiao Yi said yes.

371
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,460
You have a long trial period with me here.

372
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,260
If you don't pass...

373
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,090
If he doesn't pass, then what?

374
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,960
He'll know what I mean!

375
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,620
Uncle Cheng, don't worry.

376
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,410
I'll definitely do well

377
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,690
and pass the trial period smoothly.

378
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,730
Dad.

379
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,600
Who are you calling "dad"?!

380
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,700
Be careful that Uncle Cheng... did you hang up?

381
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,450
- I hung up! I hung up!
- You did?

382
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,890
Tell you what, take three shots now

383
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,560
and I'll go explain to Uncle Cheng.

384
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,100
Drink, drink, drink!

385
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,810
Oh right.

386
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,760
Why didn't Xiao Ke come?

387
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,360
I called him.

388
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,940
He said he wasn't feeling well

389
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,040
so he wouldn't be coming. He doesn't want to spoil the mood.

390
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,230
Okay then.

391
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,430
Come, come! I hope that everyone

392
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,240
will achieve new and great things this coming year.

393
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,890
Here.

394
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,080
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

395
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,500
- Thank you, Master.
- Thank you, Grand Master.

396
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,200
Cheers.

397
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,610
Brother, it's going to be the New Year soon.

398
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,680
Can we forget about all those unhappy things from before?

399
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,620
We'll do better next year.

400
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,130
Xiao Pu.

401
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,620
Thank you.

402
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:09,220
You've worked hard lately.

403
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,520
Let's go eat.

404
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,690
What are you doing?

405
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,190
Waiting for you.

406
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,200
I was just getting some drinks for everyone.

407
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,630
I haven't seen you for a whole day,

408
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,910
all because you were preparing all this food and the cake.

409
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,400
Mr. Xie said

410
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,050
he wanted to try my cooking.

411
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,420
You must be tired, right?

412
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,370
I'm not tired. Being able to cook for you

413
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,520
and all these people I like

414
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,050
makes me so happy!

415
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,920
Also, I've thought it through.

416
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,740
From now on, every day on your birthday,

417
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,270
I'll always make your cake myself.

418
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,380
Liao Liao, this is the best birthday gift I've ever gotten.

419
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,130
Tell you what. There's something even better

420
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,340
coming!

421
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,060
It's time!

422
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,900
Five, four,

423
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,780
three, two,

424
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,270
one!

425
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,310
Happy New Year!

426
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,200
Happy New Year!

427
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,290
Happy New Year!

428
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,780
Happy birthday!

429
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,980
This is the first birthday since you've been able to see color again.

430
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,500
So I wanted to give you a sky filled with color.

431
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,480
Do you like it?

432
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,100
♫ Believing the whole world is a rainbow ♫

433
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,540
♫ But it's just black and white ♫

434
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,770
♫ Yet, you allowed me to see the dazzling twinkling  ♫

435
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,300
Look at that one.

436
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,160
This year, I'll become a better GO player

437
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,650
along with Ding Lan!

438
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,440
This year,

439
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,600
I'll also be a better GO player!

440
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,250
I'll also be a better boyfriend!

441
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,540
I'll also be a better boyfriend as well!

442
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,290
Could you come up with something yourself?

443
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,010
No!

444
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,770
I need more wishes!

445
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,510
♫ Sweet movements matching the other person ♫

446
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:50,880
♫ Can't help but protect happiness ♫

447
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,420
Dad.

448
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,440
♫ Suddenly the heart is moved ♫

449
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,100
♫ Go with you on a trip ♫

450
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,700
Here, let me help you with it. Let me adjust it for you.

451
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,670
- Liao Liao! Liao Liao!
- Yes?

452
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,570
Come here.

453
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,420
- Master.
- I have something to tell you.

454
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,910
Go ahead.

455
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,690
Now that Jingchu is with you,

456
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,130
I can really rest assured.

457
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,970
All this child would think about ever since he was little was playing GO.

458
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,730
His basic life skills were such a mess.

459
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,010
When he was a kid, he relied on me.

460
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,280
From now on, he'll rely on you.

461
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,100
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

462
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,930
You two need to support each other.

463
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,030
If he dares to make you angry,

464
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,840
come talk to me and I'll back you up.

465
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,670
Then he'll be done for.

466
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,260
Master, I just heard someone is done for.

467
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,080
Who's done for?

468
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,950
It's a secret.

469
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,430
Right! It's a secret.

470
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,540
Are you guys ready?

471
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,500
Five, four, three, two, one!

472
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,840
Happy New Year!

473
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,050
- Go see how it is.
- I'll go look!

474
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,770
- Let me check.
- Let's go.

475
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,220
- I'm going back.
- I will help you up.

476
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,940
- Dad! Dad!
- Master!

477
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,060
- Master!
- Grand Master!

478
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,720
Master! Master!

479
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,860
Hurry up and call the ambulance!
