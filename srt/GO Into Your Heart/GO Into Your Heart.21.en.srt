[Episode 21]

18
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,640
I still don't understand GO, but I know people.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,800
Sheng Jingchu seems to be very nervous right now.

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,440
I don't understand GO either. I don't understand the players either.

21
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,970
Old Cheng, your Son-in-law can't win.

22
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,510
He's hasn't made a move in a while.

23
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,040
Look.

24
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,310
- What did you say?
- Say it again.

25
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,140
You're the kind who sits and talks.

26
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,820
If you can do it, then you should go play.

27
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,360
You won't even let me talk. Just look.

28
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,580
You're infuriating. I'm not letting you drink.

29
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,760
Xiao Dada, clean this up.

30
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,800
Hey!

31
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,290
Hey, Old Xie, what do you say about that white piece?

32
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,490
- This one placed here gives the feeling.
- Right.

33
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,130
Look. It's difficult for the black piece to do both things.

34
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,580
If we base it on Xiao Ke's character,

35
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,670
he won't strike without preparing his weapons.

36
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,960
I'm telling you. Xiao Ke is a ruthless player.

37
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,920
Clearly, he's thinking about ending the game by making quick attacks.

38
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,170
However, the white pieces are connected now.

39
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,080
On one hand, you have to break through; on the other hand, you have to race through.

40
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
Can the white pieces be blocked?

41
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,030
Yao Ke of dan 9's move is very surprising.

42
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,790
One stone saves two. That was a risky move.

43
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,170
That play was excellent.

44
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,290
The black stone can protect 2 places.

45
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,680
- Xiao Ke already saw this step beforehand.
- Yes, yes.

46
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,780
This one stone saves two is a rare play in GO.

47
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,310
I'm telling you. That kid, Xiao Ke's acceptance of this challenge

48
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,180
wasn't done casually.

49
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,500
He worked hard to prepare for it.

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,680
Jingchu is in danger now.

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,840
It's quite suspenseful.

52
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,260
Yao Ke came up with a surprising move.

53
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,030
Is Sheng Jingchu going to lose?

54
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,630
This is just the first round; there are 9 more.

55
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,230
No. The first round is very important.

56
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,180
If you lose the first round, your momentum is cut in half.

57
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,940
Lower your voice.

58
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,390
Look around you.

59
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,050
Look how many people are hoping he'll lose.

60
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,860
Sheng Jingchu is in a trap. You can see he's thinking very carefully.

61
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,770
Yao Ke's waiting has made him a little impatient.

62
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,530
What is he going to do?

63
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,160
Senior Brother Jing's chances of winning are going down.

64
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,520
Is he able to predict what's going to happen?

69
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,450
I'm so nervous that I'm about to throw up. My heart's going to burst.

70
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,920
Go on back inside and watch the match.

I just need some fresh air. I'll go back in when the match is over.

Look at you being so worried.

75
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,770
It's my fault.

76
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,340
Your fault? How so?

77
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,610
All this time, I've been talking to him about going on a trip.

78
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,400
So, he's spent time doing the itinerary.

He didn't get to practice.

80

Before, beating Yao Ke wasn't so difficult.

81

I've been a burden to him.

That's superb. Jingchu's exchange

87
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,240
is for taking a breath and fighting against the black stones.

88

White is now ahead. Brilliant. This is so brilliant.

89

The game is pretty much determined.

90
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,400
Jingchu's calculation is simply too advanced.

91

Who could have guessed his intention?

92
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,540
He actually wanted to ambush from there to reverse and kill Black.

93
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,770
- This is so unexpected.
- Yes.

Sheng Jingchu's strength as a GO player is truly astounding.

was great.

99

However, he allowed White to take a breath.

100

One misstep turns into an eternal regret.

If this move can hold on to Whites' structure,

Then this game would have a different result.

Uncle Cheng, your eldest daughter Cheng Yi

161
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,430
is the goddess of my dream.

162
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,830
She is my ideal type.

163
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,660
I really, really like her.

164
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,180
Except for her, I can't even look at another girl.

165
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,500
I want to be with her for the rest of my life.

166
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,160
How about accepting me as your son-in-law?

167
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,350
Uncle Cheng, I am a dragon, too.

168
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,860
How are you a dragon, too?

169
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,600
- I really am one.
- Sure, sure, sure.

170
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,230
You are a dragon waiter. Come, get up.

171
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,060
Let me tell you. You are actually quite creative.

172
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,190
Do you like Xiao Yi? In your dream!

173
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,820
It's okay to think about it yourself. It's also fine to tell me, too.

174
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,140
But don't be an idiot and tell my eldest daughter.

175
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,660
You know her personality. If she does all that...

176
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,320
Really.

177
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,500
All of you look down at me.

178
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,430
That's because you don't know the kind of person that I, Jiang Yuda, am.

179
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,230
- I am—
- Don't keep dreaming!

180
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,330
- Continue washing the dishes.
- Coming.

181
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,190
This is the first time I have seen you so tired after a competition.

182
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,300
This game was very difficult and dangerous.

183
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,940
Yao Ke's one stone saving two was played beautifully.

184
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,560
I calculated many moves, but they were all disadvantageous to me.

185
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,680
I think he has been calculating in the middle,

186
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,670
so I tried a little bit elsewhere.

187
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,990
In order to take a breath, I battled against the other black stones.

188
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,090
But if he had held on calmly,

189
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,860
I wouldn't have been able to reverse the game.

190
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,990
This is why the 10 game GO match is both feared and admired by GO players.

191
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,020
Both sides understand each other more and more

192
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,030
and fight until there is nothing left.

193
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:50,760
Yao Ke is probably the GO player who understands me the most right now.

194
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,780
We didn't go anywhere for vacation. The Maldives under the shade of coconut trees

195
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,340
with white sands by the clear water is also not happening.

196
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,930
Isn't it a pity?

197
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,900
I don't think it's a pity.

198
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,190
The Maldives will always be there, but the 10 game GO match doesn't happen often.

199
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,650
I particularly enjoy watching you play a match.

200
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,360
It's just that I ache for your hard work.

201
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,680
But you worked hard to save those vacation days.

202
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,680
I'll save again for next year.

203
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,490
You should just stay calm to prepare for the competition.

204
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,920
I'll do a good job as the caretaker for the panda.

205
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,850
Travel is great happiness,

206
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,800
and staying at home is a small fortune.

207
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,730
I like them both.

208
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,770
As for you, hurry and close your eyes. I'll keep massaging.

209
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,600
Oh, right. Don't change your game uniform.

210
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,800
This is a victory uniform. (T/N: a play on his name)

211
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,980
You can't change it either in future games. Do you understand?

212
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,280
Xiao Pu,

213
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,790
I missed by just a little bit.

214
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,440
One stone's distance.

215
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,320
I lost by a little bit.

216
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,010
How can I be so stupid?

217
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,190
What did I underestimate the enemy at that time? I underestimated the enemy.

218
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,270
Older Brother, don't you have nine more matches left?

219
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,240
Just win it next time.

220
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,600
Next time,

221
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,540
I definitely won't give him any chances.

222
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,390
I definitely won't.

223
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,960
It's early in the morning and you are playing games. Can't you...

224
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,820
You are really studying.

225
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,740
One against three.

226
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,590
Your level is quite good now.

227
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,190
Ever since I came to the restaurant, I haven't lost.

228
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,990
Who are you playing against?

229
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,600
Amateur players.

230
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
I've thought it through now.

231
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,230
For now, I won't play against professionals.

232
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,430
You know yourself.

233
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,680
What's this?

234
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,070
Are you changing your field?

235
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,100
No. Our company is planning a foodie program.

236
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,880
Why are these all foreign delicacies?

237
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,950
The director wants to take the route of global vision.

238
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,350
Let me tell you. You mustn't do it.

239
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,460
I can't say how many, but I've been to several dozens of countries.

240
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,810
I've eaten delicacies from all those countries.

241
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,860
Such as French, German, Italian, Spanish foods.

242
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,810
Amer...

243
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,760
American food doesn't have too many delicacies.

244
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,700
If you are talking about delicious taste, nothing can really match Chinese foods.

245
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,750
Your director is strange.

246
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,550
She doesn't dig into the treasure that's at home but wants to pick up regular foods from foreign countries.

247
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,060
Have you really been to that many countries?

248
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,520
I don't look like it?

249
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:34,730
Of course, you produce the programs. I don't particularly understand it, so I'm just talking casually.

250
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,700
But speaking of cooking skills, that belongs to Chef Cheng.

251
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,410
He is really awesome.

252
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,110
You can stop joking in front of me.

253
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,830
I'm being serious. Believe me.

254
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,980
The experts are among the civilians.

255
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,410
You've definitely been won over by the expert among the civilians.

256
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,080
Oh...

257
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,240
I exceeded the time.

258
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,620
- Okay.
- I lost. I lost.

259
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,160
Study diligently. I'm going to work.

260
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,290
I've been practicing every day.

261
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,860
But it won't take away from the time to love you.

262
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,860
- I'm leaving.
- Wait.

263
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,750
- I have something for you.
- You're not giving a heart sign, are you?

264
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,280
How did you know?

265
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,320
I already know all your routines.

266
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,650
Replenish your energy.

267
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,130
Thanks.

268
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,290
Sis, take care!

269
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:12,130
♫ The rays of the little sun block the wind and rain for me ♫

270
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:18,820
♫ Let me rest here a bit, rest on your shoulders.
I suddenly think that a lifetime isn't very long  ♫

271
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:26,210
♫ Let me have a taste. The taste in your hands.
It's the sun you've given me  ♫

272
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,900
[Cute cute yogurt will warm your heart]

273
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,980
Emojis.

274
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,810
Go ahead and eat the happy one first.

275
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,680
You dare damage my work!

276
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,320
I spent all morning making them.

277
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,910
To tell the truth, I wanted to use this way

278
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:40,290
to make you eat everything in one goal.

279
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,750
If you choose and pick at the ingredients, it won't be tasty anymore.

280
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,760
Okay. I'll listen to you.

281
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,740
Liao Liao, my competition

282
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,360
has used up all your annual leave.

283
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,730
I feel very guilty.

284
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,270
Before the next match,

285
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:18,110
I want to take you to a place.

286
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,170
This place doesn't have a blue sky, white clouds,

287
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,490
or palm trees, but it'll be a memorable place for you.

288
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,250
Where is this?

289
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,950
A secret!

290
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:00,050
Dad, did you drink today?

291
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,270
I didn't.

292
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,440
My beloved Dad.

293
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,120
I've been busy at work that I haven't gotten a chance to talk to you. I missed you.

294
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,050
What do you want to buy? Tell me.

295
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,600
You've been using the same trick, do you think he is dumb?

296
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,040
That's when I was young, okay?

297
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,130
Since I started working, did I ask Dad for a dime? Never!

298
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,440
What's going on? Did you cause trouble?

299
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,800
No, I didn't.

300
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,980
It's just that...

301
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,440
I want to go on a short trip this weekend.

302
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,790
Where are you going?

303
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,120
I want to go on a trip with Sheng JingChu.

304
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,670
He...

305
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,940
You two already planning to go on an overnight trip together?

306
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,800
When you go on a trip, aren't you going to stay in the same room?

307
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,780
Zhiliao, going on vacation is fine.

308
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,430
But you can't stay in one room.

309
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,200
Even though we are staying at the same hotel,

310
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,540
we're not going to stay in the same room.

311
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,210
Oh my gosh. You scared me.

312
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:16,290
Okay then. Going on a trip is fine. Go ahead.

313
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,920
You agreed?

314
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,230
So I can go.

315
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,770
Zhiliao.

316
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,130
Please don't sleep in the same room.

317
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,000
139, 140,

318
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,900
141.

319

You've been too tired lately.

322
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,710
What are you doing?

323
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,740
Counting your eyelashes.

324
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,830
I read about a legend.

325
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,750
Once you know the other person's number of eyelashes,

326
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,800
once you are in the netherworld, tell the King of Hell.

327
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,140
If the King of Hell confirms it,

328
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,690
these two people won't need to drink the Meng Po Soup.
 (T/N: The drink that makes you forget.)

329
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,680
This way, you can always remember each other

330
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,400
and become lovers again in the next life.

331
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,950
- Then continue counting.
- I've finished counting.

332
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,180
Your left eye has 141 lashes.

333
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,320
The right eye has 142 lashes.

334
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,280
Close your eyes. Let me count.

335
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,890
You really believed it?

336
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,640
The left eye has 149.

337
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,820
The right eye has 150.

338
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,820
Such nonsensical stuff

339
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,910
is only worth doing with someone who is worth your while.

340
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm going to count them every day from now on.

341
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,880
You still haven't told me where we're going.

It's already been many years.

I brought you here to have fun. Be happy.

There is a small lighthouse over there.
