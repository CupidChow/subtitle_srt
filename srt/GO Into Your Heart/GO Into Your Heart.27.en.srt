However, there is one condition.

You have to take care of your body first. Don't overwork. Understood?

I shall see what you got.

Maybe you will get stuck in the audition and never get in.

I sliced it by accident.

Why were you so careless?

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,040
It must hurt so much.

This one takes 13 minutes and 14 seconds to finish one round.

Which means "one lifetime."
(1314 in Chinese sounds like "one lifetime".)

How could I go on it with some random person?

I know what it feels like to cook every day.

Every time you mention cooking, I feel so guilty.

If I didn't have time to take care of you when you were young,

you wouldn't have had to learn how to cook at such a young age!

Actually, even until now,

However, the dish that I made today

306
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:59,110
was actually what I secretly followed in a recipe book

307
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,980
and used grandma's leftover chicken in the fridge to make. It's also that dish

308
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,990

00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,950
insignificant rebellion

321
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,080
that has planted a force, a belief,

322
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,690
in my plain and little heart

323
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,490
to let me know that food can cure the heart, and

324
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:19,270
it can also let both the one who cooks and the one who tastes the food feel happy.

325
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,890
I believe everyone has heard

326
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:45,260
that I called her Zhiliao. That's right, she is my most beloved younger sister.

327
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,690
Cheng Zhiliao, to be able to stand here with you on the same stage,

328
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,290
it's really my happiest moment as a show host.

329
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,150
I think you said one thing wrong just now.

330
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,520
Actually, no matter what you like or what you want to do,

331
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,780
your family will support you unconditionally.

332
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,670
Because love is unconditional.

333
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,410
Sorry, I'd like to ask for forgiveness from the audience

334
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,210
as well as the audience in front of the TV.

335
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,130
Because, all of a sudden, I don't want to be this competition's host.

336
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,160
Instead, I'd rather be in the role of her older sister, her family,

337
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,430
standing by her side to be with her.

338
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,460
Cheng Liao!

339
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,180
Dad is here! Dad will always support you!

340
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,280
Slowly! Dad!

341
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,270
Your leg isn't healed yet. Why are you here?

342
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,110
Dad was wrong. I will always support you two!

343
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,520
Congratulations!
 (Spoken in Cantonese)

344
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,940
Sister Yi, congratulations. The food program's viewership has set a new record.

345
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,400
Congratulations!
 (Spoken in Cantonese)

346
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,660
Congratulations to the queen.

347
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,230
Why are you being silly, too?

348
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,100
Vice President Xu is right.

349
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,830
You are the queen of our company now.

350
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,190
Besides, you are the pearl in our palm.

351
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,700
Of course, Cheng Liao shares half of the contribution.

352
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,350
When the family love was exploding on stage,

353
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,790
it was so moving.

354
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,260
It's our honor to have both of you sisters in our company.

355
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,340
I am really short of vocabulary today.

356
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,440
No need to talk more. Come, applaud!

357
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
Stop! You all can go back to work now.

358
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,900
Thanks.

359
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,640
Miss Cheng, I reserved a Michelin 3-star restaurant with a French chef.

360
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,100
It's my treat today to celebrate your victory.

361
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,160
Director, I appreciate your thought, but let's do without the meal.

362
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,420
We are all still busy with a lot of work. Let's work.

363
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,740
- Thanks. I appreciate the thought though.
- Don't we need to eat?

364
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,930
You are in such a good mood. There must be something big that you want to tell me.

365
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,800
Guess.

366
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,660
Are you trying to do everything that I've done for you?

367
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,860
It's not that.

368
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,830
Take a look. Look what this is?

369
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,940
What is it?

370
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,520
Panda Bear (Xiong Mao) and Liao Liao.

371
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,270
The initials of our names.

372
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:43,340
This... Doesn't it mean extra-large?

373
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,470
Aren't you being too straightforward?

374
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,500
You are even laughing. Okay then.

375
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,160
If you think of it as extra-large, go ahead.

376
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,730
Then...

377
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,320
I want you to give me extra courage.

378
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,530
What is it?

379
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,280
Liao Liao, do you want to resign?

380
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,490
After participating in the cooking competition,

381
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,500
I seem to know more about what I want.

382
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,570
But I am the kind who weakens when I need to make a decision.

383
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,180
I am particularly worried that my sister will be worried

384
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,440
and that Dad will be upset.

385
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,960
Most importantly,

386
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,630
I'm afraid that I don't have real talent.

387
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,700
If I lose my current job,

388
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,560
I still may not achieve anything.

389
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,480
Achieve nothing? That's not so bad.

390
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,740
That will give me the opportunity to support you.

391
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,750
You look down on me. You think I will achieve nothing.

392
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,060
I just want to tell you.

393
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,340
Once you've thought it through, just do it.

394
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,030
You've already proven yourself.

395
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,460
Previously, you even consoled me to let go of the thought of winning and losing.

396
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,160
You also need to let go of success or failure.

397
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,380
You are not cooking in order to succeed.

398
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,990
It's for your passion.

399
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,280
Be brave. I'll be here for you.

400
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,850
Also,

401
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,150
I said I could support you.

402
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,130
I really mean it.

403
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,820
Except for me, who else can you support?

404
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,330
Hey, you are actually thinking about it.

405
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,230
I'm going to tie you up with me.

406
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,870
I'm not going to let you run away.

407
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,320
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

408
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,370
Where?

409
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:14,110
To make a Hongmen Banquet.
 (T/N: Historically referring to a banquet with a murderous plot.)

410
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,680
Slowly, Uncle.

411
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,010
Be careful.

412
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,080
- Uncle.
- Jingchu.

413
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,670
Come. This way, please.

414
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,620
Come. Please sit.

415
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,770
Jingchu, you prepared all these?

416
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,100
Too bad we have two chefs in our family,

417
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,120
one is single-legged, the other has a broken arm.

418
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,340
Panda especially found a top Chinese restaurant to order a feast.

419
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,330
You'll have to suffer through by tasting the cuisine made by a national-level chef.

420
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,400
- Jingchu, it's costing you. Thanks.
- You are courteous.

421
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,520
Uncle, sanitize before you eat.

422
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,590
- Can't I just go wash my hands?
- No need.

423
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,280
It's faster this way.

424
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,330
You are so thoughtful.

425
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,820
This dish looks great. Let's hurry. I'm about to starve to death.

426
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,010
You can eat then. I'm leaving now.

427
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,640
Isn't this to welcome me? Let's eat together.

428
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,120
- I'm not hungry.
- I'm really starving.

429
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,000
You are not hungry either.

430
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,360
Uncle, Xu Chi and I have to talk.

431
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,460
- We are leaving now.
- Why don't you eat first?

432
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,110
Can't we eat first before we talk?

433
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,010
Uncle, congratulations on leaving the hospital.

434
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,670
I think we should first–

435
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,890
I haven't finished talking yet.

436
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,520
Can't we eat first?

437
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,520
Wha-What's going on?

438
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,650
What exactly do you want to talk about? Can't we talk inside?

439
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,790
- I don't have anything to say to you.
- Then you... Are messing with me?

440
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,710
- You can't go inside.
- Why can't I—

441
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,280
Liao Liao needs to speak.

442
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,280
- She can speak even when I'm—
- If you are there, she won't speak.

443
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,010
- We are the same family.
- No.

444
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,660
- This is a family dinner.
- I'll invite you to eat.

445
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,930
I can walk myself. Can you not pull me?

446
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,860
- I'm really...
 - What is Jingchu doing?

447
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,880
Why do I feel this is like clearing the scene?

448
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,770
Dad, here, let me pour a cup for you first.

449
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,050
You can help us start an opening.

450
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,130
Here, you can get a cup too.

451
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,520
I haven't come home for a long time. I really missed it.

452
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,210
With this cup, I'll talk about two things.

453
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:57,150
First, we celebrate our Cheng Zhiliao

454
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,190
participating in a cooking competition for the first time, and injured her hand.

455
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,380
Under the circumstances,

456
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,400
you still got a good standing in fourth place.

457
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,220
A tiger father wouldn't have a puppy for his daughter. You shine on the first try.

458
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,100
Here, thank you, everyone.

459
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,970
Cheers.

460
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,360
Then, the second thing is,

461
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,270
Daddy needs to apologize to you. I used to object to you being in the kitchen.

462
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,110
I was too arbitrary.

463
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,800
- In that case, I should apologize too.
- Stop.

464
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,010
Dad. Sister. Actually, you don't need to apologize to me.

465
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,070
I know that you were doing it for my sake.

466
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:46,340
But I'd like to use this opportunity when we are happy

467
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,950
to discuss something with you.

468
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,630
Tell us. As long as it's something I can do within my power,

469
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,130
- I will agree.
- I want to resign.

470
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,660
What? It's not fun enough to be an amateur chef, you want to be a professional?

471
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,840
I really don't feel the interest to continue in media work.

472
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,290
I only want to return to the restaurant to help Chef Cheng cook among the smoke and fire.

473
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,460
Besides, that leg of yours hasn't recovered yet.

474
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,440
Let me give you a hand.

475
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,690
- Please?
- No.

476
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,400
You were just promising to help me.

477
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,920
- Sis...
- Don't look at me. That restaurant is his.

478
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,110
- My words don't count.
- The apology to me

479
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:36,090
is so quickly reversed. You change face faster than flipping a book's pages.

480
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,900
My guess is that Chef Cheng is thinking

481
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,260
- that it's not the right time yet.
- When will be the right time then?

482
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,840
At least wait until

483
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,500
when your hand doesn't tremble when you hold a knife.

484
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,160
I don't want to accept a disciple who is disabled.

485
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,110
Sis, does this mean the chef has agreed?

486
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,820
Dad was just worried that you'd be too anxious when your hand hasn't recovered from the injury.

487
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,720
- Chef, is what Older Sister said true?
- Didn't I already tell you?

488
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,040
As long as it's within my power to do, I will agree to whatever you want.

489
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,800
- Then the restaurant is mine?
- Of course.

490
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,600
Dad, I really

491
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,320
love you very much! Come.

492
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,060
I'll give you... drink up, I'll pour some more for you.

493
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,780
Here, here, here.

494
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,610
Just one cup. It's fine.

495
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,990
No, this is too much.

496
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,730
Cheng Zhiliao!

497
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,920
It's fine.

498
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,290
You really can't drink anymore.

499
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,150
What did the doctor say?

500
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,310
Enter.

501
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,300
Director.

502
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,130
Cheng Liao? Have you recovered from the injury already?

503
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,140
I'm recovered. Thank you, Director.

504
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,860
That's good. Next, you will settle down to work then.

505
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,290
It so happens that I have a very important assignment for you.

506
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,730
Super Slow GO Tournament Qingdao Site is about to start.

507
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:58,060
Need I say more?

508
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,410
Here.

509
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,350
