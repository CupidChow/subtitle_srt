Are you joking? I'm the European champion.

54
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,920
I went to high school abroad at the age of 14 and I was all alone.

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,900
So I turned to the traditional arts of piano, chess, calligraphy, and painting

56
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,270

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,710
be brave and be in love.

162
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,690
Hey, we are talking about you. How come you started feeding me chicken soup?

163
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,170
My business is not important. I'm not done yet.

164
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,600
Stop being so careless from now on. He is a public figure after all.

165
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,890
You guys can't clear things up and start another scandal,

166
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,170
and then confess in public. It's bad for his reputation, you know?

167
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,830
I didn't want to do that either.

168
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,560
I think you don't know how good you have it.

169
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,780
I'm not eating it. Take it away.

170
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,560
You are only eating this little?

171
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,730
Give it to dad.

172
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,250
Are you really not going to consider being with Brother Xu Chi?

173
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,960
It's adult business. Don't intervene, kid.

174
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,450
- I'm going then.
- See you.

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,180
Sister, don't tell dad about me and Sheng Jingchu.

176
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,030
How are you still hiding it from him? You guys are literally on the trending page every day.

177
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,240
Isn't that all a misunderstanding? Dad must know it's fake.

178
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,670
If he thinks it's real, he won't joke with me about it.

179
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,270
I'm just afraid that he will have a strong reaction when he learns that I'm in a relationship.

180
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,690
Great God, what should I do?

181
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,290
I haven't thought of how to repay you. My older sister

182
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,160
has already regarded you as her brother-in-law.

183
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,830
Great God, Great God, are you asleep?

184
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,530
Not yet.

185
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,860
That fast?

186
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,240
Not yet.

187
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,970
Even though I'm not rich at this moment,

188
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,610
but I have already thought of how to repay you.

189
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,170
Please let me use your kitchen.

190
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,010
Anytime.

191
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,920
[Sunac: A Tour Town, A Tour A Life]

192
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,080
I bought these from the supermarket this morning.

193
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,260
Let me tell you. I had to fight to grab this fresh fish.

194
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,400
Do you often buy groceries?

195
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,690
Although I'm not a professional chef, I'm a professional foodie.

196
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,740
If I want to cook something nice for you,

197
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,500
I must use fresh ingredients.

198
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,450
I have already thought of what to cook. I must cook the food that you remember.

199
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,340
Must you be that persistent?

200
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,790
This is the only way I can think of to repay you.

201
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,800
Who did you learn to cook from? Uncle Cheng?

202
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,410
I'm a natural chef. I taught myself.

203
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,530
I lived with my grandmother when I was young.

204
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,270
My grandmother's cooking...

205
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,500
Although it's not filial for me to say this,

206
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,830
after eating her food and surviving, I have a great life.

207
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,300
My father used to be busy with work and didn't have time to cook for us.

208
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,150
Fortunately, I have a sensitive nose. It was really easy for me to learn how to cook.

209
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,080
I secretly cooked and ate.

210
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,620
My older sister joined my rank later.

211
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,420
I secretly cooked and she ate on the sly.

212
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,550
And then the whole family rebelled

213
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,590
and took away the cooking rights of our grandmother.

214
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,790
The food in my family improved thereafter.

215
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,360
Hence, whatever I encountered later,

216
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,480
whether they are happy or unhappy, I would cook some nice food for myself.

217
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,970
Of course, I would regard it as a celebration if I'm happy.

218
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,480
If I'm sad,

219
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,090
I would regard it as an annoyance and finished it in a bite.

220
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,530
I would have the strength to fight again after I was done eating.

221
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,420
I'm going to start. Do you want to avoid this?

222
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,210
Can I stay here and secretly learn from you?

223
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,670
If you stay here like a supervisor, I will be nervous.

224
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,990
Try this and let me have your opinion.

225
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,240
- How is it?
- Not bad.

226
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,990
Is the taste similar to what you can recall?

227
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,380
This means it's still a little different.

228
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,720
The spoon... I...

229
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,520
It's fine. Let's eat.

230
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,130
So to say,

231
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,110
my problem is the procedure

232
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,410
or the ingredients?

233
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,380
Frankly, the taste is not bad.

234
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,650
Do you know comparing to sight,

235
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,970
the sense of smell and taste last longer.

236
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,310
Not to mention a great GO player with exceptional memory like you,

237
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,210
even patients who are demented

238
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,700
would remember things they'd smelled and tasted when they were kids.

239
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,360
I've heard similar theories.

240
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,210
That's why people say good food can really cure people's hearts,

241
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,170
but the taste has to be just right.

242
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,230
Even a little difference can erase the effect.

243
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,450
But I won't give up. Trust me.

244
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,170
I trust you.

245
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,670
Is this the yellowstone stamp that you retrieved?

246
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,560
The smell of this Agalloch is so strange.

247
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,340
The smell is lighter than other Agalloch,

248
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,650
but it lasts longer. It's calming.

249
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,870
If you like it, you can have it.

250
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,610
No need. I'm just smelling it.

251
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,670
Your garden is also special.

252
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,620
What's so special about it?

253
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,400
Other people's gardens

254
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,800
have flowers if they are going for elegance.

255
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,020
Or vegetables if they are practical. Your garden

256
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,130
just has one tree and grass.

257
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,900
It's such a waste.

258
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,510
GO God,

259
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,040
even though I don't know how to make Songsao Fish Porridge yet,

260
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,500
I now know another way to repay you.

261
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,070
That will do in the meantime.

262
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,510
What strange idea are you coming up with now?

263
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,450
You have such a wonderful space.

264
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,620
It's so dull of you for doing nothing to it.

265
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,950
Make this place a transparent flower house.

266
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,840
Plant flowers here in all seasons.

267
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,530
Wow, you will be living a god's life.

268
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,970
Since you said it,

269
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,070
please let me live like a god.

270
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,150
Really? Are you okay with it?

271
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,190
- I'm only worried that it will exhaust you.
- It won't!

272
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,670
You have no idea how happy it makes a gardener like me.

273
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,100
From now on, I will come every day after work and every weekend.

274
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,390
It should be done in no time.

275
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,580
In that case, you will be here often, right?

276
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,200
May I?

277
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,130
- It's settled then.
- Okay.

278
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,730
- Director Liu.
- Sit down!

279
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,340
Have some coffee.

280
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,790
Thank you, Director Liu.

281
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,720
You don't have to be so courteous. I'm not thirsty.

282
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,500
It's fine.

283
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,520
Liaoliao,

284
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,980
even though you are good friends with President Xu, I'm still the one in charge of the show.

285
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,450
I have to make my requests clear.

286
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,240
Please do tell. I will do all I can to fulfill them.

287
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,070
Since you are with Sheng Jingchu now,

288
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,140
I won't make up gossips about you.

289
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,730
You two will have your own space and be in a relationship like normal.

290
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:41,060
After all, we're all on the same team.

291
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,330
Thank you.

292
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,910
How are you going to repay me then?

293
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,430
Anything.

294
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,150
I just love your personality!

295
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,960
In this Four Seas Jiuzhou Cup, Jiuzhou Hall is the leader in to fighting against top players from different countries.

296
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,130
Before the competition begins, you go do an exclusive interview for me.

297
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,230
I can let Sheng Jingchu off, but the other players,

298
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,740
you have to find some big news.

299
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,610
How big?

300
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,600
If it attracts attention, don't let it slide.

301
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,660
Not even a single detail.

302
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,560

303
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,630
You what?

304
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,320
I will do my best.

306
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,600
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

307
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,340
I have high hopes for you. Fighting!

308
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,430
I have to go.

309
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,050
Go ahead. Wait. Coffee.

310
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,110
Drink this. It gives you energy.

311
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,640
- Thank you, Director Liu.
- You can do this!

312
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,580
- Goodbye, Zhi Liao. See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

321
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
If my older sister keeps rejecting you,

322
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
will you give up?

323
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No, I will keep pursuing

324
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,200
until she agrees.

325
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,080
But with my older sister's personality,

326
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,800
whatever she decides, it's often very difficult to change.

327
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,700
Now that I'm back, I don't want to miss her again.

328
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,600
I hope your effort will move her.

329
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,200
Good luck.

330
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm leaving.

00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,200
Sister Yi, you should take some days off and go relax.

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,600
If you are always feeling down, you may get sick.

335
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm fine. I'm feeling great.

336
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,400
I've been with you all these years, I can tell.

Even though I don't know how to console you,

338

I want you to be happy.

Don't worry. I know how to make myself happy.

What's wrong? Are you feeling down?

351

Today, I formally said goodbye to Brother Xu Chi.

352
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,480
Are you letting it go?

353
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,600
Sometimes I still think about it.

354
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,200
But since I already understand what his feelings are,

355
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,600
I should let it go no matter what.

356

Eat away the unhappiness.

Eat away the unhappiness.

But, actually, other than this,

359
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,000
I also have something else that makes me unhappy.

What is it?

Will you participate in the Four Seas Jiuzhou Cup?

I'm a member of Jiuzhou, of course I will.

363

The director wants me to do interviews at Four Seas Jiuzhou Cup.

364
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But there are so many GO players,

365
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,600
I don't know where to start.

- One more whiskey.
- Okay.

From now on, I will watch every episode of your program.

No.

No matter how bad a state you are in,

385

I'm certain I'm worse by 100 times.

386

I took a long trip to return and challenge famous GO halls.

387
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,000
I actually got crushed by a little female GO player.

388

I thought I was a genius.

392
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
But after I return to the country, I discovered that,

393
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,400
compared to these domestic GO players,

394
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I'm not even qualified to play GO.

395
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,400
I was humbled into the dust.

396
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,800
For people,

397
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,800
no matter how high a position you used to be in,

398
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
there will always be a day to be humbled.

399
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,600
I definitely won't give up GO.

400
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,500
Even if I work side jobs, I will persist in living.

401
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,440
I definitely will find a teacher and become successful.

It's good to be happy. Being happy is the most important.

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,220
When we play GO, we often see this kind of unusual formation.

411
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,230
It's a formation that can take away

412
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,260
each other's stone.

It's fine. That...

422

To let more people know about GO by promoting through media reports,

423
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,560
it's a good thing.

Besides, Jingchu came to the hall

you must not be restrained.

Okay, okay.

429
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,860
In the game of GO, there is a concept of occurrence.

430
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,860
Within a small board, from simple to complex,

431
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,170
you can see how things occur step-by-step.

432

For two stones that are far apart, how do they influence each other?

It's a simple chemical reaction. It may look to have a lot of changes,

437
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,810
but actually, it is only an immutable model.

438
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,610
How can it compare to the profound game of GO?

Little Senior Sister-in-Law, this is the power of celebrity.

440
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,130
GO is the same.

441
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:06,610
In other words, a portion of the outstanding GO players must become popular first.

442
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,480
Are you referring to GO players like Ke Jie and Sheng Jingchu?

443
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,470
But they are already famous.

444
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:20,100
That's why I'm saying to let a portion of the excellent players become popular first.

445
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,180
It's for sure not enough to have those two.

So, add Yao Ke?

- Will my face look big on the screen?
- It's not big.

448
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,990
Should I tie up my hair or let it down?

449
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,830
Tie it up, and you look neat. Let it down, you look adorable.

450
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,180
I'll tie it up. It makes me look independent and capable.

451
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,180
I want to use my idol as my role model.

452
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,970
Who is your idol?

453
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,620
It's also a female GO player, 9th Dan professional.

454
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,190
She is a living legend among us female GO players.

455
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:56,110
She is the one who gave me the confidence to feel that I can compete with male GO players.

456
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,690
I really wish that I can play a game of GO with her someday.

457
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,200
Therefore, I set a goal for myself.

458
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,950
I must be like my idol when it was years ago, treat GO as my number one.

459
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,710
Until I'm a 7th Dan professional, I won't fall in love.

460
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,960
What if... What if you run into someone you really like?

461
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,350
That's impossible. GO is the one I love.

480
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,690
♫ Gently moving about in my blue sky ♫

481
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:28,620
♫ Like the key to my dreams moving back and forth ♫

485
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,460
Hello?

486
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,990
Okay, I'll go down now.

487
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,700
The food you ordered.

488
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,730
Big Brother, I'm extremely sorry. I usually pass out flyers,

489
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,660
but the store is too busy, so the boss got me to deliver orders.

490
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,690
I was unfamiliar with the roads, so I got here late.

491
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,240
It's fine. It's a night snack, so it's good to eat it really late.

492
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,810
Thank you, Big Brother. I was rejected over ten times.

493
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,820
I'm really appreciative.

494
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,180
Big Brother, don't move. Let me.

495
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,950
I'm pulling the zipper. It's stuck.

496
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,660
Let me. Let me.

497
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,060
Let me. Let me.

498
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,370
This... This...

499
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,290
Big Brother, is your tie okay?

500
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,350
It's fine. It's not your fault.

501
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,630
I'm really sorry.

502
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,190
Bro,

503
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,920
are you free?

504
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,840
I asked her in front of everyone whether she wanted to be with me.

505
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,510
And then?

506
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,210
She refused.

507
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,500
What kind of woman is she?

508
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,030
Her standards must be too high. She can't even accept such an elite executive like you.

509
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,730
Many things depend on fate.

510
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Come, Bro.

511
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,010
At least you have someone to confess to.

512
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:20,310
Unlike me, I'm in much more pain.

513
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,500
You got refused, too?

514
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,840
By a woman with a story.

515
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,670
And then?

516
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,030
And then it was just an accident.

517
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,030
In her eyes, I saw sadness and loneliness.

518
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:40,360
These two things exist in me, too.

519
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,330
During those days when I was abroad, I didn't have any friends.

520
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,020
To resonate with that kind of gaze, it doesn't need any talking.

521
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,240
It can suddenly strike into my heart.

522
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,360
Before I had the chance to confess, she disappeared.

523
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,330
She didn't even leave any contact information.

524
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,480
You shouldn't give up either.

525
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,010
If the two of you are fated, you will see each other again.

526
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,980
But when you see her again, don't let her get away so easily.

527
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,410
Thanks, Brother. I never imagined...

528
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:25,050
that you are actually the person who is the warmest to me in this city. Here.

529
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,310
I hope you will successfully pursue your woman soon.

530
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,520
I hope you will successfully pursue your woman soon.

531
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,970
Did you sleep well?

532
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:53,030
How long did I sleep?

533
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,470
What time is it now?

534
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,140
11:30 p.m.

535
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,610
11:30 p.m? Why didn't you wake me up?

536
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,570
I saw that you were sleeping soundly, so I wanted to let you rest a little longer.

537
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,470
- Hello?
- You're not home in the middle of the night. Where are you?

538
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,050
I'm... at a friend's house.

539
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,090
This Yan Xiao is really something.

540
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,930
She wanted you to volunteer to work overtime?

541
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,900
This rain is too big. How about this? You should stay at her place tonight.

542
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,570
Don't come home. Be safe.

543
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,710
No, Dad. This...

544
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,960
My dad said...

545
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,050
I don't need to go home tonight.
