I've been to the hall so many times,

If I used these to decorate my family's eatery,

it would be a bit too extravagant. Right?

These are Yongzi. They're made in Yunnan Baoshan.

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,180
Baoshan was called Yongchang.

34
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,570
He was a Yongchang person from the Ming dynasty, Mr. Li Dezhang.

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,860
Using local southern red agate, jadeite jade,

36
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,240
and jade through extraction, he made these pieces.

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Because it was made in Yongchang, it's called Yongzi.

38

These really are quite exquisite,

61
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,480
why did you think of playing GO with me?

62
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,170
Jingchu, your GO style

63
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,300
has changed recently.

64
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,730
Especially the game against He Yu.

65
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,610
You were willing to give up a few areas

66
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,050
and build a wall outside

67
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,680
to surround the open space.

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,810
It looks like you've thought it through.

69
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,260
You're no longer quite so stubborn.

70
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,620
Master, I didn't think much actually.

71
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,330
I was only playing based on intuition.

72
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,340
You didn't have that intuition before.

73
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,550
You would do whatever it took to revive the dead areas.

74
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,320
You were never able to think this freely.

75
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,410
The way you play GO is a reflection of your heart and mind.

76
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,670
Your mindset has changed.

77

99
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,550
to discuss if I could attend as a male competitor.

It originally was Yao Ke but after the 10-Game GO match,

101
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,450
his condition hasn't been well.

102
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,650
He doesn't come out in the public often.

103

Neither does he compete in competitions.

104

I couldn't directly refuse the GO association's task.

105
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,420

That's why I recommended her to the head of the GO academy.

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,960
Psychology is just that magical.

166
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,250
When your mental problem is fixed,

167
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,950
this world is immediately filled with color.

168
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,920
But you can't stop taking the medication.

169
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,110
Right now, she's...

170
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,990
my girlfriend.

171
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,240
That's good! That's very good, Mr. Sheng.

172
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,950
It's like you brought the whole pharmacy to your house.

173
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,200
But did you tell her

174
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,580
that you can see her in color?

175
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,460
I've been meaning to tell her,

176
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,800
but I haven't found the right moment.

177
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,570
You can't delay it!

178
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,940
When it comes to this, it's better to take the initiative to tell them and do it sooner.

179
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,540
This, no matter if it's about your medical condition or your relationship,

180
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,990
will be beneficial. I mean, if you don't tell her now

181
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,120
and girls are quite observant,

182
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,300
she'll figure it out herself later,

183
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,890
when that happens, it'll be over. All the work you did will go down the drain.

184
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,150
At first, I wanted to tell her,

185
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,640
but I was afraid that she would find me weird.

186
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,120
And now,

187
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,900
I'm afraid she'd be upset,

188
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,280
so I don't know where to start.

189
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,170
You GO players,

190
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,060
overthink things too much.

191
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,960
When you're sick, you go to the doctor. When you have things to say, you tell the person.

192
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,350
It's the same thing. None of it should be procrastinated.

193
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,080
Okay.

194
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,810
Once I get back from the international competition,

195
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,890
I will tell her everything from beginning to end.

196
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,310
You need to get ahold of it. Speed is of the essence.

197
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,170
Dr. Chang Lai, will still need to come often?

198
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,220
Just remember my name is Chang Lai.
 (T/N: meaning: Come Often)

199
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,650
He Yu?

200
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,590
How did you know about this place?

201
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,100
You're Sheng Jingchu's girlfriend. There's gossip about you all over online.

202
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,510
It's not difficult to find where you are.

203
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,990
Do you need anything from me?

204
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,260
Are you not open yet?

205
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,800
Not yet, but soon.

206
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,410
Let's talk somewhere else then.

207
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,600
Thanks.

208
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,400
Can we talk now?

209
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,120
I thought you would come to find me.

210
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,390
Why would I come to find you?

211
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,200
Looks like you still don't know yet.

212
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,590
I'm the one going abroad with Sheng Jingchu to compete in the mixed games.

213
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,300
It really is you?!

214
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,010
It was assigned by the GO Academy. Usually, you can't refuse it,

215
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,830
unless there's an urgent situation,

216
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,510
such as illness or an unexpected event.

217
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,420
Therefore, I hope you won't interfere.

218
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,300
Don't have him pretend to be sick, even more so don't lie for him.

219
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,840
You're a good-looking person,

220
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,130
but why do you say such ugly things?

221
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,370
What's this interfering, pretending to be sick, lying?

222
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,790
You sure are good with these terms.

223
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,130
I just like being direct when I speak.

224
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,860
What a coincidence! I do too.

225
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,080
Since Sheng Jingchu has decided to compete,

226
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,970
I would never ask him to break his promise or hold him back.

227
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,410
Isn't it just going abroad to compete? Why would I stop him?

228
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,390
Your personality is pretty straightforward and generous,

229
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,480
looks like there are some good points to you.

230
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,790
Thank you.

231
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,680
However, that's not enough for you to be worth of Sheng Jingchu.

232
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
You can totally find someone at the same level,

233
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,290
who's also likable.

234
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,620
But Sheng Jingchu should belong to me.

235
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,470
I say you've gotten me so angry to the point it's making me laugh.

236
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,470
When I had Sheng Jingchu interview you last time, it was because the company gave me that assignment.

237
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,120
You don't think I really gave him to you, do you?

238
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,240
Hey, pretty lady, let me ask you this.

239
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,100
How many times have you met him? How many times have you spoken with him?

240
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,170
Why do you think he belongs to you?

241
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,490
I haven't seen Sheng Jingchu many times in real life.

242
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,280
But, in here,

243
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,460
we've already communicated countless times.

244
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,460
See the game and know the person. I've watched all of his matches,

245
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,250
countless games,

246
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,760
so I know very clearly

247
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,020
that he and I can be perfectly matched soulmates.

248
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,250
You've studied his GO games.

249
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,300
But he hasn't studied your games.

250
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,910
How did you two communicate?

251
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,390
I knew you wouldn't understand.

252
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,950
I don't need to understand.

253
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,860
Do you dare make a bet?

254
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,930
- Bet on what?
- Bet that, before the competition

255
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,920
and during the competition, Sheng Jingchu and I won't communicate,

256
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,690
but we can still coordinate on a tacit understanding.

257
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,410
If we win the competition,

258
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,690
it'll prove that I'm Sheng Jingchu's perfect partner.

259
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,240
At that time, he'll understand that clearly and choose me.

260
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,100
All you need to do is to accept that you lost the bet.

261
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,560
Leave him in a dignified manner.

262
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,340
I've noticed that there's something very similar between you and Sheng Jingchu.

263
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,560
Why are you both so childish when it comes to feelings?

264
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,120
Why should I bet with you?

265
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,860
If I lose,

266
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,980
I'll definitely disappear without a trace, and I'll never come to find you again.

267
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,220
Isn't this very fair? Why not take the bet?

268
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,340
Betting carries a risk.

269
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,270
Caution is required when entering the game.

270
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,750
Doesn't this mean you're not confident?

271
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,580
Did you come just to talk about these things?

272
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,120
I came to deliver a declaration of war.

273
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,660
Declaration of war? I think you're openly trying to steal.

274
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,750
In broad daylight, you want to rob someone?

275
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,630
Think whatever you want.

276
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,320
Let me tell you. I absolutely won't block him from going to the competition.

277
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,530
Furthermore, I'll definitely encourage him to go.

278
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,860
I understand my Panda Bear. You have no chance.

279
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,520
Looks like you'll be going with him then.

280
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,210
If I go, I'm a dog. Goodbye.

281
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,360
What's the matter? You look so bitter and resentful.

282
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,840
I've been robbed!

283
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,530
- What was stolen?
- Sheng Jingchu!

284
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,980
I know, that one called He Yu, right?

285
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,440
Right now, everyone in the world knows that she wants to snatch your boyfriend.

286
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,020
She actually came to find me today.

287
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,750
She's pretty enough,

288
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,050
but she talks so nastily.

289
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,400
Why do I hear words inside your words?

290
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,840
Is it that our little Zhiliao has grown up?

291
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,470
You're starting to get a sense of crisis and know to worry?

292
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,720
I'm not worried!

293
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,250
Our Panda Bear has many fans.

294
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,250
All together they're enough to circle the earth.

295
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,290
If I had to worry about each of them, wouldn't my hair have turned white already?

296
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,250
It's one thing that they are jointly competing in the mixed doubles,

297
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,320
but they are also going abroad.

298
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,940
When they go abroad, will they sit next to each other on the plane?

299
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,500
When they go abroad, won't they see each other every day?

300
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,160
Will their rooms also be next to each other?

301
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,060
Will they eat together every day?

302
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,980
When I think about all that, my head wants to explode!

303
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,260
It's okay.

304
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,000
You like Sheng Jingchu, that's why you're jealous. That's all normal.

305
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,040
But you know, when two people are together, the most important thing is trust.

306
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,160
As long as you know in your heart that he won't run away, that's enough.

307
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,800
Don't think wild thoughts, okay?

308
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,080
- Let's eat. Let's eat.
- Take it slow.

309
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,280
- Come, come, let's eat.
- Slowly.

310
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,210
How did our Astro Boy end up personally cooking today? What a treat!
(T/N: Astro Boy is a Japanese manga where humans exist with robots.)

311
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,650
My restaurant has been taken away.

312
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,080
I should practice with my hands and enjoy it at home. Right?

313
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,180
That's enough. Don't keep thinking about it. Eat.

314
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,520
I'm not eating. I'm going to find Sheng Jingchu.

315
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,020
Liao Liao, I'm going to ask the GO Academy

316
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,380
to replace me with someone else for the competition.

317
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,210
You can't. What are you going to tell them?

318
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,550
You can't say

319
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,190
that you're afraid your girlfriend will be jealous.

320
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,750
But I have conflicts with her.

321
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,320
I'm sure that will affect the game.

322
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,260
Why do you have conflicts with her?

323
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,570
She makes my girlfriend jealous.

324
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,800
Panda Bear, actually I really want you to go to this competition.

325
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,390
I want you to do your best and win glory for the county.

326
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:47,640
But... can you let Xiao Qi go with you?

327
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,650
Don't mention him.

328
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,430
His daughter is having a baby, so he can't get away.

329
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,930
He doesn't even have a girlfriend, where did he get a daughter?

330
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,650
His cat is having babies, so he's staying to take care of her.

331
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,830
Liao Liao, come with me.

332
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,390
Looks like you'll be going with him then.

333
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,900
If I go, I'm a dog. Goodbye.

334
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,410
I'm not going.

335
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,540
Why?

336
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,660
Because... I have trust.

337
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,380
Besides, there's a bunch of things I need to do with the restaurant.

338
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,350
I can't keep clinging to you, can I?

339
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,550
It's fine, as long as I know you're thinking about me.

340
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,250
I never would've imagined that I'd picked up such an understanding girlfriend from a public bus.

341
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,020
Then be good and wait for me.

342
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,630
I'll go win a champion's trophy for you.

343
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,640
Don't worry too much about the restaurant. Just wait for me to return.

344
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,450
Be at ease and go to the competition.

345
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,410
I'll wait for you.

346
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,050
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

347
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,350
- Mr. Driver.
- Yes, Mr. Sheng.

348
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,870
Take the luggage out. I'll call a car on my own.

349
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,180
Mr. Sheng, the GO Academy's leadership has ordered

350
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,380
that all itineraries will be uniformly managed.

351
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,110
Please don't make it difficult for me.

352
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,770
Get in, Sheng Jingchu.

353
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,300
Please, get the luggage out.

354
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,390
You should get in.

355
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,090
Good luck at the competition. I'll wait for you to return.

356
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,910
Go on. Go. Go.

357
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,010
Water?

358
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,410
No.

359
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,190
I brought you this, to use on the plane.

360
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,760
No need.

361
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,150
You don't dare look at me?

362
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,850
- I dare.
- Then, why don't you look at me?

363
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,780
I don't want to look.

364
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,160
I'm the same with others too, except for you.

365
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm not like this to the others.

366
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,070
Then I'm also an exception for you.

367
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,810
I'm happy!

368
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,700
Brother, it's straight ahead.

369
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,260
Yes, it's this one: the Changlai Psychology Consultation.

370
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,610
It's right inside.

371
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,330
- Wait for me here.
- Okay.

372
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,190
Hello.

373
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,150
Do you do psychological counseling?

374
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,690
Did you make an appointment?

375
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,710
Sorry, I didn't.

376
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,260
It's a bit sudden.

377
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,400
No-No problem. Sit, sit. Wait a moment.

378
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,130
This... is for etiquette.

379
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,620
You don't understand those of us that wear wigs.

380
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,410
I don't like wearing it. It's uncomfortable.

381
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,130
Okay then. Let's talk about your situation.

382
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,260
Don't worry.

383
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,410
I'm the same towards patients and friends.

384
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,630
Even if you don't want to get counseling,

385
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,430
you can still come often.

386
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,120
Doctor, actually I...

387
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,390
- can't see colors.
- Congenital color blindness.
- No.

388
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,140
I can only see white and black.

389
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,760
I think it's a mental issue. Can you cure it?

390
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,250
I sure can! I'm an expert on this issue.

391
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,520
Could be said that there are instant results, immediate cures.

392
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,210
I just cured a case. I understand this illness particularly well.

393
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,390
Have you ever been agitated

394
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,250
psychologically in a huge way?

395
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,950
- Yes.
- That's right.

396
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,540
Psychological agitation can be reflected physiologically in a person.

397
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,200
There can be some

398
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,300
barriers or things like that.

399
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,360
Doctor, what you say makes sense.

400
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,680
But recently when I saw someone, she was in color.

401
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,090
So coincidental.

402
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,350
What do you mean?

403
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,780
No, nothing. Don't mind me. Keep talking.

404
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,830
Okay.

405
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,370
Whenever I see this person, she's in color.

406
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,340
And only she's in color.

407
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,390
I've become especially excited. I don't know what to do.

408
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,590
All I can think of is how to see her again.

409
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,790
When you saw her again,

410
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,260
did you ever feel like the colored area was enlarged?

411
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,250
Yes.

412
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,020
Okay. Your illness is very simple.

413
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,370
Doctor, have you ever cured this kind of patient?

414
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,480
Of course.

415
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,130
My other patient has a similar situation as yours.

416
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,020
He... When he...

417
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,530
This-This involves a patient's privacy. I can't talk about it.

418
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,610
But don't you worry. If I lie,

419
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,380
may I never grow hair again?

420
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,530
I'm at ease then.

421
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,620
Brother, how did it go?

422
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,820
[Changlai Psychology Consultation]

423
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,620
Everything matched up.

424
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,940
This is great.

425
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,460
It proves that everything you heard before is all true.

426
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,220
That's right.

427
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,240
The doctor recommended that Sheng Jingchu get closer to Cheng Liao.

428
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,030
As long as Cheng Liao stays with him, the colored area that he sees will get bigger.

429
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,760
What? Isn't this too fantastic? Is this real?

430
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,320
That's why Sheng Jingchu really cherishes Cheng Liao. When I think of it more, Cheng Liao is quite pitiful.

431
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,520
Perhaps she's only a tool for Sheng Jingchu to cure his psychological problem.

432
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,120
This isn't love. It's a selfish desire.

433
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,140
But if Cheng Liao leaves Sheng Jingchu,

434
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,550
he'll collapse.

435
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,050
Then, Brother, what do we do next?

436
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,590
Send this flyer to Sheng Jingchu's home. And then...

437
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,950
invite everyone to dinner.

438
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,740
Dinner?

439
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,300
Times have changed.

440
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,170
Two little youngsters are showing affection in the hall.

441
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,700
We're not showing affection! We're just

442
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,770
fellow disciples in normal training.

443
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,360
Right, normal training.

444
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,940
Do you call this way of training normally?

445
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,500
- Yes.
- Is this normal?

446
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,460
What's not normal?

447
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,270
Is this normal?

448
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,580
Is this normal? Is this normal?

449
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,100
You're publicly showing affection.

450
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,710
It's normal.

451
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,890
It's very normal.

452
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,360
Oh my god, this is—

453
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,270
Wow, so lively!

454
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,480
It's Junior Brother.

455
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,760
Did you drink the health tea I gave you?

456
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,540
I drank it, Senior Brother.

457
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,020
- You look much better.
- Is that so?

458
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,460
Even your hair quality has improved.

459
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,040
Don't worry, Eldest Senior Brother.

460
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,520
I came over this time to discuss timing with everyone.

461
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,860
Tomorrow night,

462
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,080
I want to treat everyone to dinner.

463
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,990
Your treat? Great!

464
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,140
Panda Bear, have you eaten?

465
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,080
Not yet. I just got to the room and haven't put things away yet.

466
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,990
You just got there.

467
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,630
Your stomach and intestines probably aren't accustomed yet.

468
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,250
Don't eat too randomly.

469
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,230
Why aren't you saying anything?

470
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,450
I just want to have a good look at you.

471
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,790
Liao Liao, do you miss me?

472
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,670
I... don't miss you.

473
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,230
Then I can only...

474
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,940
You can only what?

475
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,680
Unilaterally say that I miss you.

476
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,390
Let me open the door.

477
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,710
- Why is it you?
 - I'm worried that you are not used to the food here.

478
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,610
I especially ordered Chinese food. Let's eat together.

479
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,380
No need. I don't want to see you.

480
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,350
This He Yu looks aloof and cold,

481
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,330
but why is she using the same trick as Zhang Lisha?

482
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,610
Always running to someone else's room to eat.

483
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,760
- Didn't I do well rejecting?

But you don't need to thank me. Because he'll be mine very soon.

He Yu, even though I don't know how to play GO,

487
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,590
but...

488
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,780
Isn't blind confidence a taboo for GO players?

489
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,410
Blind confidence and having a well-prepared plan

490
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,150
are two entirely different concepts.

491

- Hello, express delivery.
- Thanks, let's see what it is.

You have express delivery.

 - Mr. Sheng, come here please.
- Wait a moment.

Okay. Hurry and go.

Senior Brother Jing isn't here today.

I'll say something embarrassing.

Back then, I was full of self-confidence to sincerely

ask Senior Brother Jing to play the 10-Game GO match.

544
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,450
But in the end? It was a crushing defeat.

545
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,820
Junior Brother, wins and losses on the GO board

546
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,440
are very normal.

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,850
You're a 9 dan.

00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:55,170
We all know your strength. Isn't that right?

549
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,890
Senior Brother Jing is too strong. Don't mind it so much.

550
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,150
Senior Brother Xihe, I don't blame anyone for losing.

My own strength isn't good enough.

552
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,830
To tell the truth,

553
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,120
lately, I've really been particularly...

554
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,500
depressed.

555
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,000

Then the next second,

558
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,800
there are different types of comments putting me down online.

559
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,600
Ridiculing me.

560
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,600
I want to say honestly,

561
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,000
recently, when it came to attending competitions, even

562

563
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,100
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

564
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,000
I want to say honestly,

565
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I just can't undo the knot in my heart.

566
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,400
A heart knot...

567
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,400
I think everyone at the bottom of their heart has one.

568
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,500
Look at me. As a professional female GO player,

569
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,800
I was single-mindedly determined to advance to 7 dan.

570
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Yet, sometimes I feel

571
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
full of confidence, that I'm really good.

572
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,500
Yet, sometimes I feel that my skills are lacking. That I'm nothing at all.

Sometimes in the dead of the night,

when I'm alone,

575
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,400
worrying about the losses and wins gets really depressing.

576
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,700
Talking about depression. Recently, I...

577
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
My feelings are as if they were on a rollercoaster.

Clearly, what I want the most is right in front of me.

Once you reach out your hand,

580
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,800
she takes it away from you.

581
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,800
As you reach out your hand, she takes it away from you.

unexpected setbacks.

592
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,600
That'll leave behind some significant and difficult to put down knots in our hearts.

Then one day, you overcome the issue yourself.

Junior Brother, listen to me.

597

If you really think you have some kind of psychological problem,

598
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,060
you definitely have to go seek professional

599
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,300
help and treatment. You got it?

600
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,600
- Psychological illness?
- Right.

601
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,100
Psychological illness...

602
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,320
If you're sick then you have to get treated!

603
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
You have to find a doctor and get treated!

604
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,200
I recently met quite an impressive psychologist.

605
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,600
Our Mr. Sheng has seen countless

606
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,600
psychologists. Countless.

607
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,400
With one word, the psychologist cured him.

608
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,900
Panda's been seeing a psychologist?

609
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,900
What do I know about that?

610
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,000
Cheng Liao,

611
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,900
you already know about what happened to Jingchu as a child. Right?

612
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,700
I thought after he arrived at the hall,

613
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,400
he had Master and everybody here.

614
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,300
That he already...

615
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,400
Senior Brother Jing, doesn't often talk to us about his problems.

Sister-in-Law,

617
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,200
I grew up together with Senior Brother Jing.

618
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,400
I watched with my very own eyes,

619
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,400
how he covered himself tightly, layer after layer.

620
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,400
But there was just no way.

621
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,600
There was nothing you could try.

622
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,500
Cheng Liao,

623
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,600
Jingchu's personality is too restrained.

624
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,200
All these years, his heart's loneliness and fears,

625
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,000
no one but you has ever really touched it or resolved it.

626
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,570
Him going to see a psychologist,

627
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,000
must be because there's nothing else he can do.

628
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,630
I understand now.

629
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,800
I'll be there for him.

630
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,800
I won't let him suffer alone.

631
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,400
Liao Liao, what's wrong?

632
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,600
How come I feel that you're not very happy?

633
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,200
Is it because after I left, they bullied you?

634
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,600
No.

635
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,000
Then, why are you acting strangely?

636
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,500

I should have climbed into the suitcase and gone with you.

I regret it, too.

I should have brought you, little fox, with me everywhere.

642

In the future, when you encounter something,

643
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I'll always be there with you.

644
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,400
Okay, no matter what it is in the future, I'll bring you along.

645
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,900
Also, if something makes you unhappy,

646
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,400
you have to tell me right away. You mustn't hide it from me.

647
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,010
Liao Liao,

648
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,500
after I'm back,

649
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,600
will you find some time to chat with me?

650
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,200
Not just one day.

651
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Whenever you need me, I'll be there right away.

652
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,230
- Good night.
- Good night.

653
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,920
Bye-bye.

654
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,200
Sheng Jingchu, 9 dan. He Yu, 5 dan.

655
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,100
Thank you for accepting my interview,

656
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,600
as China's media representative for the Paris Mixed GO Competition.

657
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,000
You've both coordinated well with each other.

658
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Thank you.

659
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,620
Mr. Sheng, as usual, you treat your words like gold.
(T/N: a person of few words)

660
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,800
Then let's cut to the main topic.

661
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,600
As far as I know, you were put together at the last minute for the competition.

662
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,800
Then facing opponents who have prepared,

663
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,500
practiced together, and are well coordinated,

664
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,600
are we confident in winning the competition?

665
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,700
Of course, we are.

666
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,600
Because I believe that the degree of compatibility between people

667
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,600
doesn't only depend on the time spent together to be accumulated,

668
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,200
but similar levels of intelligence and cognitive levels are the foundation to

669
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,000
quickly understanding each other and building a tacit understanding.

670
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,200
Then let me wish you both overwhelming victories.

671
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,800
Can I bother the two of you for a picture?

672
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,600
Of course.

673
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,400
Three, Two, One.

674
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

675
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

676
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,800
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

677
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,200
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

678
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,200
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

679
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,400
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

680
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,800
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

681
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,800
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

682
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,800
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

683
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,800
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

684
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,900
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

685
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,200
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

686
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,400
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

687
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,400
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

688
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,000
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

689
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,800
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

690
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,800
♫ There is color all around you ♫

691
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,800
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

692
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,200
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

693
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,700
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

694
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,000
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

695
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,200
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

696
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:50,000
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

697
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,000
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

698
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

699
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,200
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

700
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,000
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

701
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,300
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

702
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:30,600
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
