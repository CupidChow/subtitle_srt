Senior Brother, the sponsorship is not going great.

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,200
Yao Ke is banned for life

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,300
which affects Jiuzhou Hall's business more or less.

21
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,400
Investors are being very careful nowadays.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,000
They don't want to offer money and resources hastily.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,220
Senior Uncle!

24
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,000
If they don't want to do it, someone will.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,700
I've brought the money god to you guys.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,800
What money god? Can you be any ruder?

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,400
And this is...

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
I hereby officially introduce

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,800
the biggest investor for Jiuzhou Hall from now on,

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
the famous entrepreneur, Mr. Jiang Bancheng.

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
My dad.

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Hello, everyone.

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,300
Thank you.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,700
Senior Uncle.

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
I will call you how Yuda calls you.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Okay. Sure.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,500
Yuda had shown me this plan a few days ago.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,000
How should I put this? It's detailed and practical.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,600
I and some of my friends who are interested have discussed it.

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
We think investing in the GO industry

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
is very valuable and it has potential in the market.

42
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Money is not a problem, but it has to be operated by professionals like you.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,200
Okay.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,300
That's all there was to it.

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,500
Senior Uncle, as the CEO of Jiuzhou GO Club,

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,800
I hope you will lead these professional players

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
and achieve great things.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
Thank you,

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,300
Father Jiang.

50
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
GO is a national treasure.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
To be able to contribute a little to GO

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
is also my pleasure.

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,600
And there is...

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,200
our little brat Yuda. He hasn't made your lives easy.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
No, he's fine.

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
How's this? We shall have dinner tonight.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
Okay, okay.

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,700
Oh no,

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,800
we can't have dinner today. I was being overexcited.

61
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,200
- I still have something important to do.
- What is it?

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,700
Don't you know?

63
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,000
- We shall meet another time.
- Okay.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
Next time.

65
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,100
- What? Wait.
- Come with me.

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,300
What is it?

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,400
- Dad.
- Uncle.

68

Sit.

71
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,650
Thanks.

72
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,800
Cheng Yi, I came to see you in a hurry

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,100
because I need to ask you for a favor. I hope you can help me.

74
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,000
Uncle, please tell me.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
You need to tell me what the favor is

76
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
before I can make the promise.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,800
No matter what it is,

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,400
you will have to do it, it seems like.

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
Dad, what are you talking about?

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,200
Did I allow you to speak? Can't I have an individual word with our guest?

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
- No.
- Why not?

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,200
- She's not our guest.
- Who is she then?

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,600
- She's my girlfriend.
- Did I agree to this?

84
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I don't care if you agree or not. She is my girlfriend.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Why are you so rude now?

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,000
That's not how your mom and I taught you.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Since when did you and my mom teach me anything?

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Didn't we teach you?

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,700
- Ever since I was a kid, we...
- Shut up, Jiang Yuda!

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm sorry, Uncle.

91
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,890
Uncle,

92
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,800
I actually was able to guess why you invited me here.

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,500
I know that I'm a few years older than him.

94
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,800
Maybe our relationship

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,200
is not blessed

96
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
by others or by you.

97
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,300
However, what I want to say is, when it comes to love,

98
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,100
we are the only two who would know if we are the right fit.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,800
After meeting him,

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,000
I suddenly started to have courage.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,300
It's the kind of courage to break all rules.

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,100
Therefore, I want to use this courage

103
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,200
to ask you

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
to allow us to be together.

105
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I want to be with him

106
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,400
for a very long time.

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,300
You're very logical and straightforward.

108
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,000
I like it.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,400
Actually, that is what I wanted to talk to you about.

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,300
His mother and I haven't been

111
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,100
taking good care of Yuda since he was little.

112
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
This kid never listens to us.

113
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,400
He always draws himself into random things, just like when I was his age.

114
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,300
But Yuda has changed these days.

115
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,000
He grew into a mature man from a careless boy.

116
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,000
I think it must have something to do with you.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You helped Yuda change a lot, which I'm very thankful for.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,600
Also, Yuda is getting so good at playing GO.

119
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,460
I'm proud of you two.

120
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,790
So what I want to say is,

121
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,300
I hope you two will be together.

122
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,300
- Do you agree?
- Of course.

123
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,200
Did I ask you?

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,400
Uncle, we didn't expect that you

125
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,500
were going to make this speech today.

126
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
Since you've already said it,

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,200
we will have to agree.

128
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Deal.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,800
However, I still have to remind you

130
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,600
that Yuda only listens to himself.

131
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,300
He doesn't care about what others do.

132
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,100
You are a little older than him. Keep him in line.

133
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,100
If he dares to bully you, tell me. I will deal with him.

134
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,800
Don't worry about that. He wouldn't dare.

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
I've heard.

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,700
- Thank you, Dad.
- Why are you so excited?

137

It's all thanks to my father, Xie Hanzhou.

Actually, he's been there all along.

Senior Brother Jing, when did you get here?

159

Before the ceremony started.

160

Why didn't you cut the ribbon with us?

We've been looking for you.

I'm now, not only

165
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,600
the senior brother of Jiuzhou Hall,

166
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600
but also the CEO of the new Jiuzhou GO Club.

167
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,100
The reason for me saying that

168
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,800
is I want to talk to you about both titles.

169
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
I hope you can reconsider it.

170
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,400
And we all want you to play for us

171
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,400
as one of our team members of the newborn club.

172
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Even if you were like me

173
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
and lose every game, it's fine.

174
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Because I believe as long as you are persistent,

175
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
everything will be fine.

176
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,090
Senior Uncle.

177
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,610
You're here, Yuda.

178
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,520
Are you leaving?

179
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,100
This city no longer has a place for me.

180
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,800
Do you still call me Senior Uncle?

181
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,080
Master said you are still the disciple of Master Xie Hanzhou.

182
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,330
No matter when, you will always be his little senior brother

183
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,510
and my senior uncle.

184
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,280
- Did Jingchu send you here?
- Yes.

185
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,090
Master told me to bring you home.

186
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,780
So you really...

187
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,350
can't play anymore.

188
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,900
If you need others to practice with you,

189
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:10,200
I can do it for as long as you need me until you are recovered.

190
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,020
Or you can have me do anything. Just ask.

191
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,910
I just hope...

192
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,270
I can make up for the mistakes I made.

193
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,260
I will see it...

194
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,610
as my redemption.

195
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,400
In the past,

196
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,480
I always thought we are very alike.

197
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,630
GO was all we saw and all we thought.

198
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,450
Including our desire for winning

199
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,390
were identical.

200
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,890
It's not wrong when picking up a stone,

201
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,350
but you were too obsessed

202
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,870
and you put the stones in the wrong places.

203
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,550
I've never seen you as my enemy,

204
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,100
because both of us are deeply in love with GO.

205
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,110
I didn't want to come here today.

206
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,980
I feel guilty.

207
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,960
However,

208
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,060
I still owe you an apology.

209
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,220
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,490
Even though you are no longer qualified for playing,

211
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,950
but we were still taught by the same teacher.

212
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,400
I actually asked you to be here to apologize to you.

213
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,460
I said many things I wasn't supposed to say

214
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,510
in order for you to tell the truth.

215
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,260
Those words must have been hurtful to you.

216
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,630
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,110
I made the mistakes first.

218
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,740
I deserved it.

219
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,330
Junior Brother Yao Ke,

220
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,670
I've never doubted your passion for GO.

221
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,040
Although you can't compete anymore,

222
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,300
I believe that when it comes to teaching students

223
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,930
and passing down GO,

224
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,440
you can find yourself

225
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,660
and your passion for GO.

226
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,730
Can I really come back?

227
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,390
Of course.

228
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,770
You will always be our little junior brother.

229
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,180
When letting go of the burden of winning,

230
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,960
you must be the best teacher in Jiuzhou.

231
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,850
Senior Brother,

232
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,740
thank you.

233
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,050
[Jiu]
(nine)

234
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,240
Panda, we've done a lot of important things

235
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,990
on this trip.

236
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,780
It's time for us to relax.

237
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,960
I want you to experience the fun and relaxation of cooking.

238
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,620
Could you help me cook, please?

239
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,970
Okay.

240
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,120
Panda, those tutorials are

241
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,850
for the simplest dishes and are beginner-friendly.

242
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,270
How about we make the beef like last time?

243
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,170
You should know how to make it.

244
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,380
Capture in one instance.

245
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,370
Capture by surrounding.

246
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,040
Connect and die move.

247
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,320
GO can be an art

248
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,840
in cooking.

249
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,110
You actually haven't really given up on GO.

250
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,060
Since that's the case, we will face it with courage.

251
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,670
Don't be afraid of the hardship. The more you are afraid of it,

252
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,290
the more you need to practice.

253
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,390
Just see it as desensitization therapy, how's that?

254
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,000
You just keep playing GO,

255
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,050
to the point where you can face your opponent with confidence.

256
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,470
Are you cooking for Jingchu?

257
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,540
Senior Brother, are you still sad?

258
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,590
I... Why would I?

259
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,090
I'm so happy to see Rumei doing so well.

260
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,700
- Really?
- Cheng Liao,

261
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,800
sit and chat with me for a minute.

262
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,670
Do you know why people cling to things for a long time?

263
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,700
Because of regrets

264
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,360
and the feeling of emptiness.

265
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,510
This is also why

266
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,670
I never let go of missing out on Rumei.

267
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,410
Are the regret and the emptiness gone yet?

268
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,370
I waited for Rumei for ten years.

269
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,080
We still couldn't be together in the end.

270
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,290
But the day when you restored Macheng Fish Noodles,

271
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,220
after taking the first bite,

272
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:22,020
the taste in my memory had already filled the regret in my heart.

273
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,160
- The taste in your memory?
- Yes.

274
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,930
This power made me stop living with regrets.

275
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,790
It's all thanks to you.

276
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,750
Hello?

277
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Okay.

278
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,570
What would you like to eat for dinner tonight?

279
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,110
Okay, I'll go pick you up right now.

280
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,730
I have to go. Thank you, Cheng Liao.

281
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,510
You are welcome.

282
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,520
Please, sit down, sir.

283
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,200
Welcome to my Little Fox Private Eatery.

284
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,330
This is a nutritious meal customized just for you.

285
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,170
Thank you for doing this for me.

286
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,880
It's my pleasure.

287
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,120
Remember what I told you?

288
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,720
To be able to cook for the people I love,

289
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,260
to me, it's the happiest thing.

290
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,680
Panda,

291
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,730
this time just like

292
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,000
the time when you were searching for colors.

293
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,250
You just need to let go of the issue in your heart.

294
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,580
This is a marathon, not a 100 m dash.

295
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,820
You must be lonely

296
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,940
in this race,

297
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,120
and it's hard for you.

298
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,790
With you here, I don't feel lonely.

299
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:33,350
But I can't help you win the race.

300
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,730
That's why I can only do what I can

301
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,190
to make you more energized.

302
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,910
Have some fish. It's nutritious and it's not greasy.

303
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,010
Is it good?

304
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,640
I'll cook it for you every day then.

305
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,440
Liao Liao,

306
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,510
I really don't know what to do now.

307
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,510
You just said it's just like searching for colors,

308
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,780
they are all about letting go of the issues in my heart.

309
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,930
But I think they are very different.

310
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,380
When I was searching for colors,

311
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,610
I always felt like

312
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,970
there was a vague direction ahead of me

313
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,440
and lead me to where I was supposed to be.

314
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,860
But now I'm very scared.

315
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm afraid that once I walk out of the pain,

316
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,310
I will forget

317
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,160
my memories with Master,

318
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,310
just like how I forgot the taste of the fish soup my mom made.

319
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,730
Memories will fade bit by bit.

320
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,080
Do you know why people can't let go of things?

321
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,710
Because of regrets and the emptiness, like there's a hole in your heart.

322
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,610
Panda,

323
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,090
do you remember what I said to you?

324
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,380
People's memory for tastes

325
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,560
sometimes

326
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,230
are more accurate than we imagine.

327
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,920
Maybe you can't tell why,

328
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,160
but when you think it tastes wrong, it is wrong.

329
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,290
It also means that

330
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,170
you have never forgotten

331
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,440
the taste of the fish soup

332
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,490
and your memories of your parents.

333
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,330
Is that true?

334
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,810
Believe me.

335
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,860
I will definitely find the Songsao Fish Soup

336
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,170
from your memory.

337
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,780
♫ The world suddenly became calm ♫

338
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,390
♫ You walked past me ♫

339
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:44,100
♫ Disappearing quietly, your back only a silhouette ♫

340
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,940
♫ Falling into your eyes ♫

341
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,810
♫ Nowhere to hide from the longing ♫

342
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:59,600
♫ Waiting for that moment when the wind blows, bringing something to place your hope on ♫

343
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,510
♫ Please forgive my weaknesses ♫

344
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,620
♫ For cowering over and over again ♫

345
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,850
♫ Missing it over and over again ♫

346
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:15,570
♫ I pretend to be lonely and sad ♫

347
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:22,810
♫ How do get through each moment through the late night? ♫

348
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,620
♫ The city lights confuse me ♫

349
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,200
♫ The coffee in my hands has become cold ♫

350
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,850
♫ I hope you can refill it with warmth ♫

351
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,090
♫ The moment I think about you, I tremble all the time ♫

352
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,780
♫ There's no one like me ♫

353
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,540
♫ Who would go through fire and water for you ♫

354
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,130
♫ Checkmate my sincere heart and break it open ♫

355
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,100
♫ How do get through each moment through the late night? ♫

356
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,970
♫ The city lights confuse me ♫

357
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,410
♫ The coffee in my hands has become cold ♫

358
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,300
♫ I hope you can refill it with warmth ♫

359
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,200
♫ The moment I think about you, I tremble all the time ♫

360
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,130
♫ There's no one like me ♫

361
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,520
♫ Who would go through fire and water for you ♫

362
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,560
Panda, I'm very confident this time.

363
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,220
Are you ready?

364
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,900
Mind the steps.

365
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,380
Liao Liao,

366
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,010
let me taste it again.

367
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,710
Okay.

368
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,310
You finally helped me find it.

369
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,210
Panda.

370
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,540
Even the most important people in life...

371
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,410
have a time for them to leave us.

372
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,480
Sometimes...

373
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,490
we might put aside the memories we have about them.

374
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,110
But it doesn't mean that we forget about them.

375
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,700
As long as we still have memories of them,

376
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,730
they are always there for us.

377
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,920
Just like when you thought you started to forget about the taste of Songsao Fish Soup,

378
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,390
but it's just like your parents,

379
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,280
the memories of them have always been

380
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,380
stored in the most precious part of your heart.

381
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,660
I believe that GO is the same.

382
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,970
Every time you hold the stones,

383
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,790
Master is there right next to you.

384
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,280
Could you teach me how to play GO?

385
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,210
Jingchu, you came.

386
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,820
Master,

387
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,750
I finally understand it now.

388
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,480
Life...

389
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,130
is a continuous process of winning and losing.

390
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,810
However, the things that we lose...

391
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,320
won't really disappear...

392
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,760
without leaving behind any traces.

393
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,430
All the experiences

394
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,550
are carved into your life.

395
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,850
In your heart, it becomes a signal that never dies.

396
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,450
Master.

397
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,220
I will carry along these beautiful memories...

398
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,930
bravely...

399
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,220
continue living on.

400
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,050
Jingchu, this last assignment,

401
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,940
you have completed it very well.

402
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:21,480
I can now... go without worries.

Welcome to everyone watching Yan Xiao's Talk by Pinecone Video.

411

New Chinese comics Swordsman's heart is already at the far corners of the world.

412
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,150
This show is brought to you by the new Swordsman mobile game.

413
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,660
It is officially authorized by Jin Yong. It has a stunning and charming Chinese style.
(TN: Jin Yong is a pen name of a famous novelist.)

414
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,980
Hello, everyone. I am your host, Yan Xiao.

415
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,730
Today, we're happy to be able to invite two guests.

416
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,030
First, congratulations to our legendary Sheng Jingchu.

417
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:08,980
This time Jiuzhou Hall under your leadership and a new appearance has won the competition's

418
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,990
grand slam. Congratulations.

419
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,550
Also, thank you this time for bringing

420
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,550
your fiancée, Miss Cheng Liao, to

421
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:20,830
our exclusive interview by Pinecone Video Yan Xiao's Talk.

422
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,510
It is our honor.

423
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,750
It is ours as well.

424
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,920
Mr. Sheng Jingchu as a legend of GO,

425
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,050
and your fiancée was once an ambassador of flavor seeking.

426
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,380
You both participated in the Pinecone Video's show, The Taste of Memories.

427
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,590
I know your Uncle Cheng's Restaurant has become a popular restaurant to netizens.

428
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,800
Both of you have become known to netizens as a "Match made in Heaven" couple.

429
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,060
Moreover, a lot of netizens support your relationship.

430
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,070
So on behalf of the netizens, I want to ask Miss Cheng Liao.

431
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,610
The first time you met the legendary Sheng Jingchu,

432
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,870
what was it like? Can you describe it for us?

433
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,220
Do I need to say it? Don't you already know all of it?

434
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,080
I'm doing my job.

435
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,260
The first time I met him...

436
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,100
it was... At that time, I had an interview.

437
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,810
I was chasing the bus and then...

438
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,900
Then, I just...

439
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:19,440
We met for the very first time

440
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,310
when I was six years old

441
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,370
at the hospital.

442
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,850
I was crying and...

443
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,350
she gave me a piece of pomelo candy.

444
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,840
Then, Mr. Sheng Jingchu,

445
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,420
can you use one phrase to describe

446
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,240
your relationship with your fiancée, Miss Cheng Liao?

447
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,170
"With everything I have,

448
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,920
I will do as you wish."

449
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:58,070
Then, do you have anything else to tell each other?

450
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,740
I won't let you listen to it.

451
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,530
Panda,

452
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:13,270
our memories of when we first meet

453
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,020
probably aren't the same.

454
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,690
But I want to tell you,

455
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,700
that day on the bus, tightly holding on to you was

456
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,540
the most accurate decision that I made in this lifetime.

457
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:31,270
♫ Just like that, I suddenly thought of loving you ♫

458
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,850
♫ Believing the whole world is a rainbow ♫

459
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,420
♫ But it's just black and white ♫

460
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,470
Liao Liao...

461
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,130
even crossing over many mountains and hills
(T/N: a long and difficult journey)

462
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,410
and the blue seas changing into mulberry fields...
(TN: Figurative way of saying the time changes.)

463
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:51,000
♫ You're like the gentle breeze in my face ♫

464
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,960
...you still came to me.

465
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,060
♫ Like the key to my dreams moving back and forth ♫

466
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,100
♫ That romantic universe ♫

467
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,310
Your arrival made this dull and lonely life

468
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,450
became more colorful.

469
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,870
You arrival into this silent world

470
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,030
made it more lively.

471
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,090
Your arrival like the spring breeze

472
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,290
bloomed bright and beautifully.

473
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,530
Traveling through a crowd,

474
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,500
the one I can see and only ever will see is you.

475
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:44,380
[The End]

476
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:07,200
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

477
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,220
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

478
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,930
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

479
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,590
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

480
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:23,630
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

481
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,470
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

482
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:32,010
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

483
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,050
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

484
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:41,790
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

485
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,950
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

486
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,970
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

487
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,260
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

488
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:28,590
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

489
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,680
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

490
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,190
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

491
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,960
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

492
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,030
♫ There is color all around you ♫

493
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,890
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

494
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,470
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

495
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,650
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

496
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:11,400
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

497
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,460
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

498
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:21,320
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

499
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:27,320
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

500
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,370
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

501
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:37,270
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

502
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:42,190
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

503
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,210
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

504
00:46:54,690 --> 00:47:02,350
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
