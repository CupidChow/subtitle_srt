00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 8]

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,440
My older sister treats me the best.

19
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,570
She would never let me suffer any bullying.

20
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,880
She's beautiful and she studies well.

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,190
She is the top example for every family's children.

22
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,110
Someone like her

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,340
should be with Brother Xu Chi; childhood sweethearts and a match made in Heaven.

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,200
Do you think,

25
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,090
as a regular person on Earth,

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,810
should I not have had such a fantasy?

27
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,450
I don't know what's been wrong with me lately.

28
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,480
I fought with my life's force to be with Brother Xu Chi.

29
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,480
Then it turns out,

30
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,950
I ended up in romantic gossip with a GO God like you.

31
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,010
How can I describe my latest emotional state? It's...

32
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,460
It's really frustrating and sad.

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,850
Let me tell you.

34
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,010
I've always thought that Brother Xu Chi and I

35
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,620
were a match made in Heaven,

36
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,350
childhood sweethearts.

37
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,410
Do you know when I started to like him?

38
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,320
Say something! You haven't said a word, leaving me all alone.

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,160
Nag, nag, nag,

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,730
as if I were drunk.

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,820
Okay. When?

42
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,700
In 7th grade.

43
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,760
The school was inspecting our appearance and clothing,

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,380
and... we were forbidden to have long hair. Our school's dean

45
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,780
caught me at the entrance of the school.

46
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,720
The second day, at school,

47
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,590
I climbed over the wall to get into the school.

48
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,080
You can climb over walls?

49
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,330
However, as I was going up the wall...

50
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,290
I was able to get on the wall...

51
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,230
but I couldn't get down.

52
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,890
Did Xu Chi help you get down?

53
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,140
I remember it. I remember, that day,

54
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,790
he was wearing a black suit,

55
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,240
the suit had buttons in the front.

56
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,440
At that time, he stood

57
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,590
at the bottom of the wall. He looked at me.

58
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,050
He said to me with a smile,

59
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,090
"Zhiliao, come on down.

60
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm at the bottom. I'll be like this... I'll be like this...

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,280
I'll catch you like this."

62
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,760
The way he was smiling at me, I thought he was especially handsome.

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,490
And then I took the initiative,

64
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,140
just like this,

65
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,160
I jumped into his embrace.

66
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,520
But I didn't jump well,

67
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,860
so we both fell. I thought his immediate reaction

68
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,220
would be... to push me away.

69
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,590
And then, he didn't do that. He hugged me tightly.

70
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,720
And then,

71
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,960
he told me, "Zhiliao...

72
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,840
Zhiliao, are you in pain from the fall?"

73
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,770
After all these years,

74
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,590
that one sentence,

75
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,430
I've always remembered it.

76
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,870
Every year, he would come back for the holidays

77
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,960
and take me out to have fun.

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,040
And whatever requests I had,

79
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,440
any requests, he would always say yes to.

80
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:10,850
I really didn't expect that it was my older sister he loved.

81
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,780
Why?

82
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,800
Why wasn't it me that he loved?

83
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,880
Why my sister?

84
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,560
Miss, I can't believe you're up.

85
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,780
Are you hungry? I can make some food for you.

86
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,730
Dad, I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

87
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,440
What celebration party were you at yesterday?

88
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,380
How did you get so drunk?

89
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,500
How did I get back?

90
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,990
You came back by yourself.

91
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,590
You knocked on the door so hard that you almost woke up the neighbors.

92
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,550
I came back by myself?

93
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,180
You came back by yourself!

94
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,430
- Nobody brought me back?
- Nobody brought you back.

95
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,350
Hungry? I'll go make you some food.

96
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,370
My brain...

97
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,210
I'm hungry.

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,540
Is this your home?

99
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,550
This is bad! Very bad!

100
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
- Hello?
 - Hello, GO God.

101
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,710
You're awake. Does your head hurt?

102
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,870
A little. Not a big problem.

103
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,690
Have a cup of honey water.

104
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,830
How did I get home last night?

105
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,100
I brought you home.

106
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,610
But when I got to your door,

107
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,550
you pushed me out and insisted on knocking on the door yourself.

108
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,160
Daddy, open up!

109
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,420
Open up!

110
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,890
Did I say anything weird?

111
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,480
No.

112
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,170
Except for telling me the whole story

113
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,330
of how you fell in love with Xu Chi.

114
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,520
Everything that happened yesterday can only be our little secret.

115
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,590
You can't tell anyone else.

116
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,300
Okay.

117
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,250
GO God, thank you for coming to my rescue yesterday.

118
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,910
And also thank you for listening to me talk so much. I have a question.

119
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,760
Other than that, what other embarrassing things did I do?

120
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,620
You threw up everywhere in my house.

121
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,150
Does that count?

122
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,550
I... I'm sorry.

123
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,760
And you...

124
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,340
Okay, we're even now.

125
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,950
Too much had happened last night and I don't know if I can go to work today.

126
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,620
It wasn't that bad. I was messing with you.

127
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,140
There's something else.

128
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,590
From other people's perspectives,

129
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,130
you've accepted my confession of love.

130
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,720
So you're my boyfriend now.

131
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,320
Can I trouble you again to clear this up?

132
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,420
Clear it up again?

133
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,240
It's fine for an ordinary person like me.

134
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,380
I'm afraid it might ruin the reputation of a celebrity like you.

135
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,470
It's not good for either of us if we keep clearing up everything.

136
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,090
I think we should just leave it as it is.

137

Then... okay.

138

Can you pretend to be my boyfriend for a period of time?

Don't worry, I won't do anything that embarrasses you.

Xiao Ke.

147
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,400
You didn't expect the white stone would jump, did you?

148
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,440
The black stones are doing a connection

149
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,470
to prevent being cut off by the white stones.

150
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,280
Do you see that?

151
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,540
On this battlefield,

152
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,980
it looks like the black stones are taking the initiative,

153
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,640
but actually, they've neglected to see the positions of the white stones.

154
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,370
The black stone makes the connection.

155
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,200
The white stone cuts off the connection.

156
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,510
The black stone can't connect.

157
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,430
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

158
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,300
Yes. Look, the white stone jumps now

159
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,140
and maximizes the effect.

160
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,900
The white stone looks like it's moving slowly,

161
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,250
wandering in the garden built by the black stone,

162
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,030
but this is actually a very significant, profound

163
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,200
strategy to both attack and defend.

164
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,130

324
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,800
Why?

325
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,150
Because you owe me a favor.

326
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,760
I don't want to wait too long.

327
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,940
Do you really have that little patience?

328
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,780
I'm afraid I won't be able to wait until that day.

329
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,010
It's tomorrow. Consider that the way to pay me back.

330
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,240
All right, Mr. Scrooge.

331
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,070
What would you like to eat?

332
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,320
Fried noodles with beef okay?

333
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,660
You haven't been here in so long and you still remember my favorite?

334
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,960
I remember all your favorites.

335
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,790
Hello.

336
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,150
This one and this one.

337
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,320
- Thank you.
- Just a moment.

338

Old Xu.

339
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,540
We grew up together and we're brothers; buddies.

340
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,630
You did that thing to me last night...

341
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,520
I almost strangled you right there, I was so angry.

342
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,880
Why would you confess to me, are you nuts?

343
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,760
When I met you the very first time, I knew I liked you.

344
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,600
But our gap was too big at that time. I had no opportunity to approach you.

345
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,200
That's why I played the role of your friend all these years.

346
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,010
I've been working so hard to become the person that you like.

347
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,460
I know this is the only way to be worthy of you.

348
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,490
You know we both...

349
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,490
is not because of whether we're a match or not.

350
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,450
Do you know how I feel?

351
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,570
It feels like a close relative

352
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,920
or some cousin came to me and confessed.

353
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,880
That feeling is just too weird, too creepy.

354
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,340
I understand. It's really hard for you to accept me so suddenly.

355
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,110
But I believe you'll think it through one day.

356
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,580
I'm the one who suits you best, understands you best.

357
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,860
Then, what if I can't think this through?

358
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,830
It's okay, I can wait.

359
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,160
I've been waiting for all these years, I can keep on waiting.

360
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,320
Because my name is Xu Chi.
(T/N: "Chi" means "late")

361
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,180
It will never be too late for you to agree to be with me.

362
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,500
Food's here, let's eat first.

363
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,800
I'll take you home after.

Why are we meeting so early?

367
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,320
What are we doing at my junior high school?

368
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,560
- I wanted to see it.
- See it?

369
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,740
Have you seen my social media feed?

370
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,770
The movie we saw,

371
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,080
the cheesecake we ate,

372
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,350
and now revisiting my junior high school were all on my previous social media posts.

373
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,270
I was thinking if I could fulfill all your wishes,

374
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,280
it would improve your mood.

375
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,820
Please lead the way.

[Our hundred-year plan, education is the principle]

378
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,020
This building... was our classroom building.

379
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,880
My classroom was on the 4th floor.

380
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,300
I was always late to class because those four flights of stairs were nothing to laugh about.

381
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,320
It was worse during lunchtime,

382
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,720
everyone rushing and flooding into the cafeteria.

383
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,240
As for me, by the time I got there,

384
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,290
there were only vegetables left.

385
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,250
I couldn't find a single piece of meat.

386
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,320
I'm telling you, all those food stalls nearby were so good.

387
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,190
I visited them every day after school. I never got tired of the taste.

388
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,270
- I'll take you there next time to try it.
- Okay.

389
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,330
That's the noticeboard that posted our exam results.

390
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,980
I was never brave enough to check my scores.

391
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,670
Look over there. That's our school auditorium.

392
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,990
Over there was where Brother Xu taught me basketball.

393
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,820
He laughed at me for my three-step layup.

394
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:47,030
This is where Brother Xi caught me from the wall.

395
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,840
I just wanted to make you happy.

396
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,160
I know.

397
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,990
But at the moment, you don't look happy at all.

398
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,690
How come?

399
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,550
You can watch a movie by yourself,

400
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,690
you can also eat a cheesecake by yourself.

401
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,300
If you think of your school, you can come back at any time.

402
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:28,030
But I just didn't watch it, eat it or come here.

403
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:34,370
These things are the same as how Brother Xu secretly bought those matching items for my sister.

404
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,630
Hoping one day, that person will notice,

405
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:42,190
and then you can tell them, "Let's be together."

406
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,490
Are you really disappointed

407
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,000
that I'm the one who came with you?

408
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,710
No.

409
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,690
I shouldn't be telling you all these things. It makes me seem so immature.

410
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,520
Do you know how to make someone in a bad mood cheer up?

411

I'm sorry you need to work overtime on the weekend.

478
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,110
That's my job. The guest list and the script for the next episode of Cheng Yi Conversation need to be finalized.

479
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,500
The reason I wanted to see you was because of that.

480
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,790
Our main sponsor has decided to withdraw their sponsorship.

481
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,360
There will only be three more episodes of Cheng Yi Conversation,

482
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,590
consider it a finishing touch.

483
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,000
Think about how you want it to look and feel.

484
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,320
I know talk shows are becoming harder to produce.

485
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,750
But it doesn't mean they should pull the investment just like that, right?

486
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,460
Can we look for other sponsors? I can negotiate with them myself.

487
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,010
It'll be difficult, the ratings are the hurdle.

488
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,860
We've talked to a few companies, they don't like the numbers.

489
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,260
After these three episodes, we'll pause the production temporarily.

490
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,970
Also, there's a surprise interview tonight,

491
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,060
I'll have someone send you the information in a bit.

492
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,210
It's a group interview.

493
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,390
Take the crew to CBD.
(T/N: Central Business District)

494
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,570
Station Chief Gao, now you want me...

495
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,680
to do outside reporting?

496
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,040
Xiao Cheng, it's temporary.

497
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,280
We're short of staff.

498
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,370
I can only trouble you to do some outside reporting.

499
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,530
I believe in your experience and your ability.

500
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,210
You perform your best no matter what assignment you have.

501
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,570
Okay, I got it.

502
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,640
What made you think of exchanging them for a big one?

503
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,650
This little fox reminds me

504
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,500
of the emoji you shared.

505
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,180
It's really cute.

506
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,150
What makes a boy like you become so good at the claw machine?

507
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,630
That... is because of Xihe.

508
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,870
He liked my agarwood and yellowstone seals.

509
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,870
But I didn't want to just give them to him.

510
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,950
So he tried different ways...

511
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,960
to lure me to the arcade to get plush toys.

512
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,270
And use that as a bet.

513
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,890
- You lost, didn’t you?
- Yes.

514
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,620
I lost my seals to him.

515
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,660
But I hate losing, so I practiced some more.

516
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,900
Then I used those seals as bait,

517
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,680
and won them back.

518
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,130
Why are you guys so childish?

519
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,270
Because we were young then.

520
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:36,600
You're not much older now.

521
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,880
GO God,

522
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,040
today,

523
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,630
I was really happy.

524
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,090
That's good.

525
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,900
No need to thank me.

526
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,390
Thanks!

527
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,770
You saw through me so quickly.

528
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,140
There is a bug in your hair.

529
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,720
Bug? Where?

530
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,390
Where are there bugs! I'm scared of bugs! My god!

531
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,170
Slow down!

532
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,420
The bug has flown off already!

533
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,480
- It's flown away? I don't believe you.
- It's gone!

534
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,140
Oh.. card... card... card.

535
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:21,920
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

536
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,830
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

537
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:30,560
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

538
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,880
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

539
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,060
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

540
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,600
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

541
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,580
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

542
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,630
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

543
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:56,710
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

544
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:01,950
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

545
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,000
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

546
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:20,460
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

547
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:43,310
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

548
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:47,290
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

549
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:51,760
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

550
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,750
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

551
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,590
♫ There is color all around you ♫

552
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,580
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

553
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,300
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

554
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,910
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

555
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:26,050
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

556
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,980
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

557
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:35,850
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

558
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:41,700
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

559
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,910
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

560
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:51,730
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

561
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:57,070
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

562
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,030
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

563
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:16,470
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
