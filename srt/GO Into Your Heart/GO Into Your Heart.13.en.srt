17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,000
[Episode 13]

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,430
GO God!

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,200
I was so scared just now!

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Even though I don't understand GO games,

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
but I heard the commentator keep saying

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,600
that Sheng Jingchu was losing. I should have gone up to turn off his mic.

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Are you feeling better now?

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm fine now.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,600
GO God is truly the GO God. It was like you were in a Hollywood movie.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
At the last second, you reversed the loss to win.

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,700
If Katou Kiyomasa didn't make a mistake, I wouldn't have been able to reverse the game.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,610
Is that book especially important to you?

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,400
Your mood is still down?

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,300
I was hugged by someone before the game, so my mood relaxed a lot.

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,400
I just didn't know how to help you at that time.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,200
Let's go eat cake tonight.

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,400
You played all day, you must be tired, and your mood is down.

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Let's eat together after you've won the competition.

35

Cheng Liao,

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,600
phone call from Director Liu.

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll go answer the call first.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
Let's eat together after you finish the competition. Do you best! Rest well!

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,000
How are you? Can you talk about the situation at the competition?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Hello, can you talk about it?

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,700
Mr. Sheng. Mr. Sheng.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,400
Mr. Sheng, please tell us.

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm sorry, what was your move just now?

44
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,800
Jo Yeon Hoon, winner.

45
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,700
Oh yes, Mr. Cao.
 (speaking in Korean)

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,400
No.

47
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,800
Mr. Cao,

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,200
I've been feeling curious. You kept staring at me during the game.

49
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,600
What exactly were you looking at?

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,300
I'm not used to it.

51
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,000
Not used to it?

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,900
Not used to looking at it?
 (Idiom: Can't stand someone.)

53
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Forget it.

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,600
Don't be angry anymore.

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Is it worth a stupid book?

56
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Besides, it's not anything expensive.

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I didn't keep it for myself. I just threw it away.

58
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
It's technically not stealing.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,300
Even now, you still don't think you made a mistake?

60
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,200
If it's not stealing, what is it?

61
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,400
I did it for your sake.

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,200
This is how you help me?

63
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,500
Sheng Jingchu's condition was indeed worse than before.

64
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
I know that, of course.

65
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,800
But is this what I want?

66
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
I've already told you many times.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,300
I want to defeat him with my own ability.

68
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,300
I know that you will defeat him sooner or later.

69
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300
I was just thinking of making it sooner as much as possible.

70
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,400
So you stole it?

71
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,800
When your parents entrusted you to me years ago, is this what you've ended up learning?

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm not that way.

73
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
You're still arguing?

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,400
Fine. Fine.

75
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
Go home then. You should buy a ticket and go back home right now.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,200
I can't control you.

77
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,200
Older Brother,

78
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,000
why don't you understand me? Didn't I do it for your sake?

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I couldn't stand Sheng Jingchu early on.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Go out, go out.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
- Older Brother, don't be upset.
- Leave!

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Brother, I know I did wrong.

83
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,700
I've seen how you've won here and there all these years,

84
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,000
but you'd lose whenever you meet Sheng Jingchu.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Because of that Sheng Jingchu, you lost a lot of championships.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,800
You'd lock yourself inside all day,

87
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,300
not eat well and not sleep well, and would practice like crazy.

88
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,800
For me, I feel bad when I see that.

89
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,600
Older Brother, don't make me leave. Okay?

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,900
Let me stay with you. I'll do anything.

91
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,400
Brother,

92
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,100
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,770
Get up.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Little Jingchu.

95
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Little Jingchu,

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,900
what do you think of this book?

97
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,300
Master, I can't understand it.

98
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Of course, you can't understand it.

99
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
I gave you this book

100
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,800
so that you can read it slowly when you grow up.

101
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
How about I tell you a story?

102
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,500
Okay, Master. Tell me.

103
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,000
The author of this book is Laozi.
(A famous Chinese philosopher.)

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,600
When Laozi was about your age, he studied under a scholar

105
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,400
as his master, whose name was Shang Rong.

106
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
One day, Laozi asked his master a question.

107
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,800
Unexpectedly, his master couldn't answer it.

108
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Without the answer,

109
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,600
Laozi was very nervous and blamed himself.

110
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,800
He felt that he shouldn't have asked that question.

111
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,000
However, his master didn't blame him and happily told him,

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,400
Master leads you to study, but growth relies on the individual."

113
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,000
If you don't have the answer, it doesn't matter.

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Perhaps, this is the direction that you will seek and explore from now on.

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,100
Someday you may have the answer,

116
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,800
you'll be stronger than Master at that time.

117
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Master, can I surpass you?

118
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Of course. You'll definitely be strong than I am in the future.

119
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Will you be unhappy?

120
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Why would I be? I'll be so proud.

121
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,300
Okay, I will definitely surpass you.

122
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,400
Okay, it's a deal.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
[Competition Room B]

124
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,100
Make way please.

125
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Mr. Zhao is here.

126
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,200
Mr. Zhao, are you confident about this game?

127
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Mr. Sheng,

128
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,570
you didn't sleep well?

129
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,570
Senior Brother Jing's condition still doesn't look good.

130
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,800
Didn't you go stay with him yesterday?

131
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,000
I saw that he wasn't in a good mood yesterday, so I didn't dare to bother him.

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Besides, didn't he win yesterday?

133
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,800
Katou was being careless yesterday.

134
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,800
The important thing here is that Jo Yeon Hoon has comparable strength,

135
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
and he is especially adept in mental battles.

136
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,400
He is more difficult than Katou to deal with.

137
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,200
If I had known, I should have gone to eat cakes with him yesterday.

138
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Don't worry.

139
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,500
I'll bet on him. Sheng Jingchu is GO God after all.

140
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,640
We can see my Senior Brother Jing is still full of vigor.

141
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,150
It's just that there seems to be a little bit...

142
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:25,580
Are you thinking that he is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and his thought process seems to be conflicted?

143
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,310
I wouldn't say that. You are exaggerating.

144
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,890
Look! My Senior Brother Jing's condition is still very good.

145
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,810
It's just that, compared to some of his previous conditions,

146
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,790
it is a little bit less, just a little bit.

147
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,450
It's clear to see.

148
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,840
These two moves he made are obvious mistakes.

149
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,420
Sometimes that's how it is. The outsiders can see it clearly.

150
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,310
If I were playing this game,

151
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,790
where it's difficult to play, I would play elsewhere.

152
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,210
This move, I would place it at star position 3, 3.

153
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,720
This way, the state of the game would be totally different.

154
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,040
Xiao Jingchu is in danger.

155
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,720
He's in danger. What will he do?

156
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,710
30.

157
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,960
Jo Yeon Hoon, winner.

158
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,230
Sheng Jingchu.

159
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,300
What's wrong?

160
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,120
It's nothing. It's just the breeze is a little strong.

I'm gluttonous and want to eat.

Okay.

eating sweets will make people happy?

175
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,710
Okay, I'll do as you say.

176

Liaoliao,

177
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,180
why were you crying?

178
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,940
I saw you when you stopped the clock and conceded the game, you were looking at the ceiling,

179
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,430
and I felt bad.

180
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,440
No one wins all the time.

181
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,660
Even though it feels bad to lose a game, but it's something that every player has to face.

182
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,200
But you shouldn't have lost.

183
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,260
If that book wasn't lost,

184
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,900
or if I had come to eat cakes with you yesterday,

185
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,110
chatted with you, or if

186
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,230
I cooked some food for you, perhaps your mood would have been better.

187

That's why, at the beach today,

I was particularly feeling guilty and couldn't hold the tears in.

189
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,420
Losing a game is my own fault. It's has nothing to do with you.

190
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,880
Don't be silly and blame yourself.

191
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,870
Even though that book is very important to me,

192
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,280
but I can't carry it with me all the time.

193
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,310
This would have happened sooner or later. When Master gave me the Book of Morality,

194
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,280
he wanted me to ignore winning and losing.

195

"The best goodness is like water. It is beneficial to all things and all people without being in conflict.

196
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,800
It stays in lowly places where people despise. Therefore, it is very near Dao."

197
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,360
Even though I understand the book, but it's still difficult to achieve.

198
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,020
I just lost the game,

199

so I still can't let it go right now.

I even made you blame yourself.

201

It's not for you to worship. Get it?

Mr. Sheng! Mr. Sheng, wait.

323
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,300
Can I have a few minutes of your time?

324
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Your hotel's insulation is really substandard.

325
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's made me lose sleep every day and I didn't win the game.

326
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,600
How will you handle this matter?

327
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,700
We just arranged for you on the top floor at the Shangri-la Hotel.

328
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,800
The insulation is excellent there. You can rest easy.

329
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,600
The top floor? I have fear of heights.

330
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,200
Which floor is suitable for you? We'll change right away for you.

331
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
There is no suitable floor.

332
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,410
The color scheme of that hotel is too dark.

333
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,600
It affects my mood.

334
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,400
This hotel looks good. It's a lower building, has a warm color scheme,

335
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,800
and it's quiet around it. It matches all of your requirements.

336
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,000
It doesn't match my requirements at all.

337
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,800
See? This is a problem.

338
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,000
This skyscraper next to the hotel

339
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,200
is huge. It blocks all of my luck.

340
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,200
- Are you implying that I can't escape a calamity?
- Mr. Zhao.

341
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
The two of you keep discussing the hotels.

342
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Why did you ask me to be here?

343
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,800
Actually, it's Mr. Zhao who... who...

344
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,200
Well said. I've been waiting for you to speak.

345
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,900
I want to live in your house.

346
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,350
Does living in my house help you play better?

347
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:39,320
Actually looking at me this way. (muttering in Korean)
Of course.

348
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,050
I beat you in the first game.

349
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,750
I lost this game because I didn't rest well, so it was a mishap.

350
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,210
Before you played the first game and beat me, you were staying in the same room.

351
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,870
Tell you what, the influence will build up.

352
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,280
I'm at my limit already.

353
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,240
It's only fair if our sleeping conditions are the same.

354
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,350
You live at your home, while I live in an underqualified hotel room.

355
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:12,810
You didn't win fair and square. How does that make sense?

356
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:26,090
Okay, I will beat you with fairness then.

357
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,160
Nice.

358
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,160
Very nice house.

359
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,030
Put it down.

360
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,570
This is famous.

361
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,280
I was originally going to attend.

362
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,690
This. This is...

363
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,980
Hey. Sit over there.

364
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,700
Okay.

365
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,670
Let's watch TV.

366
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,510
Okay. Start.

367
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,800
The most fantastic...

368
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,350
Hey, you came to watch TV as well. What's good to watch...

369
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,850
You can't watch TV after 9:00 p.m.

370
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,570
So boring.

371
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,840
Okay.

372
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,900
I'm so bored.

373
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,510
I'm hungry!

374
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,870
Let's see what it has.

375
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,540
This fridge is like a convenience store.

376
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,040
What is this?

377
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,440
You scared me!

378
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,190
You scared me, Sheng Jingchu!

379
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,690
Why did you suddenly jump out?

380
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,130
What are you doing?

381
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,330
Go buy your own food.

382
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,180
Can't I just buy them from here?

383
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,100
I have cash, Alipay, and WeChat.

384
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,590
Everything here is not for sale.

385
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,240
You can't buy anything here with money. I asked you to buy them outside.

386
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,750
But I treat you as a friend. You are being so extra!

387
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,800
I didn't invite you here. You invited yourself.

388
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,190
Hey, Sheng Jingchu!

389
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,940
It's fine if you don't want me to touch your stuff.

390
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,060
I can't touch your chess board! I can't have any food! Isn't that mean?

391
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,730
I see you as a really good friend!

392
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,810
So are you staying?

393
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,510
Of course! Where?

394
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,350
Are you making me sleep on the couch?

395
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,730
That's right.

396
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,030
Don't you have a guest bedroom?

397
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,620
I don't.

398
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,650
- Isn't that the guest bedroom?
- Don't move.

399
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,660
It's for special guests. Not for you.

400
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,430
Fine.

401
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,860
It's fine.

402
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,460
I love couches. It's comfortable. Not bad.

403
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,600
Good night.

404
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,350
Good night?

405
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,480
Wait a second!

406
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Are we going to bed this early?

407
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,550
What time is it?

408
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,880
Where's the bathroom? Are there any towels? I want to take a shower.

409
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,780
So, Jo Yeon Hoon is really staying at your place?

410
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,880
Your final game is tomorrow. Wouldn't it affect you?

411
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,940
He's asleep now and he's very loud.

412
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,940
Wouldn't it bother you?

413
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,660
To be honest, a little.

414
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,900
What should you do?

415
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,920
How about this? I will climb to your house through the wifi and take Jo Yeon Hoon away.

416
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:58,580
How's this? I will do a magic trick and you will go to bed after that.

417
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,190
Okay.

418
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:08,940
A long time ago, there was a tiny little bird in the castle.

419
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,150
She is the youngest princess of the king and the queen.

420
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,050
She didn't know how to fly after having hatched a long time ago.

421
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,990
But her parents and friends never failed to encourage her.

422
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,330
She wants to fly.

423
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,970
Fly up and she shape-shifts!

424
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,190
♫ You can see through my thoughts ♫

425
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:34,420
♫ It's as if the sweet pomelo candy is about to speak ♫

426
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:39,630
♫ Quietly telling me it likes me ♫

427
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:45,770
♫ Let me secretly guess
Are you looking forward to it too? ♫

428
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:50,900
♫ That line from the bottom of my heart. Nice to meet you ♫

429
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,920
♫ The confession is in your eyes
Almost bumped into you completely ♫

430
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,270
Biu-biu-biu. She flies away!

431
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,630
I haven't got to the little sheep yet

432
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,020
and you are asleep already.

433
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,760
Okay, then. Good night.

434
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,520
Stop swaying. You are making me dizzy.

435
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,150
Would you like some heart attack pills?

436
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,980
Do you have any?

437
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,280
Stop pretending. I know you have it.

438
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,060
Look at you. Can't you have some faith in your boyfriend?

439
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,720
My boyfriend? He's not.

440
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,980
Have some faith in Sheng Jingchu.

441
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,540
Although Jo Yeon Hoon is a great Korean GO player, and your Sheng Jingchu is also...

442
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,890
Shut up, okay? Thank you.

443
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,170
Have some confidence in Sheng Jingchu. He is our legend of the GO world.

444
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,590
Even though he lost the first game, that was only him being polite. He will catch up.

445
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,030
He will definitely win the final round.

446
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,280
Be confident in him.

447
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,730
Of course, I have confidence.

448
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,400
Who is he? He is Sheng Jingchu.

449
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,620
Can he lose? No, he can't.

450
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,680
You are confident about this?

451
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,170
You look like you grew nails under your butt.

452
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:25,860
♫ The wind blows,
The moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

453
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,650
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

454
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:34,370
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

455
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,110
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

456
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,860
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

457
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,950
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

458
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:50,420
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

459
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,480
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

460
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,480
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

461
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,430
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

462
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,610
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

463
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:24,310
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

464
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:47,180
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

465
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,210
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

466
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,590
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

467
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,540
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

468
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,480
♫ There is color all around you ♫

469
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,390
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

470
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,980
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

471
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,060
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

472
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:29,790
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

473
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,870
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

474
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:39,810
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

475
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:45,770
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

476
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:49,850
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

477
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:55,780
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

478
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,760
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

479
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,540
