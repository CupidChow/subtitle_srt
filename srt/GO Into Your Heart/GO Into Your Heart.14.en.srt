Do you want to compete against yourself?

It's not certain that you'll beat me.

You'll have to defeat yourself first.

Jo Yeon Hoon is too cunning.

40
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,770
The two previous games were won by the White player.

41
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,810
He knew about Senior Brother Jing's habit of taking a black stone at the starting guess.

42
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,260
So he took a white stone to make Senior Brother Jing take Black.

43
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,570
See? Now he's playing an imitation game.

44
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,820
So what if he plays an imitation game. You're free on the GO board.

45
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,350
Imitating your opponent's game doesn't violate any game rules.

46
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,950
My Yeon Hoon-oppa can certainly play it.

47
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,010
What's an imitation game?

48
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,590
It's when one side follows the other side symmetrically to place the stones.

49
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,050
Just like how it is on the board now.

50
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,490
So, Jo Yeon Hoon's

51
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,360
white stones are placed by copying Sheng Jingchu's moves?

52
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,030
That's right.

53
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,790
However, usually, only the white will play the imitation game.

54
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,830
Because, if Black does imitation moves,

55
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,840
both sides will have the same-sized territories.

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,510
But Black must gain a 3.75 lead,

57
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,260
or it'll always be at a disadvantage.

58
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,440
Once you get to this point, you can be sure

59
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,520
Jo Yeon Hoon's white stones will continue to imitate.

60
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,040
Sheng Jingchu, you told me to go to bed early last night, but what did you go do?

61
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,540
Why don't you pursue and attack? You look so exhausted.

62
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,420
A trap of this level

63
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,720
is too immature, don't you think?

64
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,760
If you don't come up with a new strategy,

65
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,900
you'll fall behind!

66
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,050
The white stones have a clear advantage now.

67
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,470
Senior Brother Jing put a lot of effort into creating a ladder in order to break the imitation strategy.

68
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,370
In the game just now, if Yeon Hoon-oppa hadn't stop imitating in time,

69
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,790
Senior Brother Jing would have been able to use the ladder to capture the white stones.

70
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,390
Just based on the vigilance involved in this game, you can tell how amazing my Yeon Hoon-oppa is.

71
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,350
Little traitor.

72
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,890
At the current moment, Jingchu is clearly taking much more time to think than Yeon Hoon.

73
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,590
After all, he has to come up with a counter-strategy to break the imitation.

74
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,520
Whereas Jo Yeon Hoon only needs to be careful to not be captured.

75
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,800
All he needs to do is imitate Jing Chu's tactics.

76
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,390

It's all right. Senior Brother lost a lot of black stones this round;

80
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,740
however,

81
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,040
over here the black stones can take over the white stones.

82
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,520
The remaining territory will be open for the black stones.

83
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,810
Since the start of the game, Senior Brother Jingchu and Jo Yeon Hoon

84
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,280
have been fighting hand-to-hand combat. Really intense.

The black stones are struggling.

86

The white stones are readily prepared and constantly attacking.

Now the black stones are trying to reverse the play,

but the white stones are still better off. Eldest Senior Brother look,

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,720
We can eat now!

163
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,250
Let's see.

164
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,350
How is it? Doesn't it look pretty good?

165
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,050
What is this?

166
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,380
This is authentic Korean bibimbap.

167
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,290
It's perfect.

168
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,130
I meant...

169
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,050
this.

170
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,310
I picked it from your greenhouse.

171
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,990
How is it? Really luxurious right?

172
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,480
Wait! Wait!

173
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,220
Why are you doing this?

174
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,290
Hey, wait!

175
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,510
Sheng Jingchu, what are you doing?

176
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,160
Open the door! Sheng Jingchu!

177
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,750
Why did he get so mad?

178
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,500
Wait, why? W-W-Wait.

179
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,000
Why are you doing this?

180
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,380
Isn't there a Chinese saying,

181
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,030
"Borrow flowers and offer them to Buddha"? Did I offer it wrong?
(T/N: Means to win favor using something that's not yours.)

182
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,100
You didn't.

183
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,080
You borrowed the wrong flowers.

184
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,370
Wait! You have so many flowers!

185
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,810
Sheng Jingchu!

186
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,570
You're not keeping your promise!

187
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,530
I'm homeless! Where do I go?

188
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,650
[Director Liu]

189
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Hello? Director Liu, hear me out.

190
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,700
This time I planned to wait

191
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,860
until after the competition to interview Sheng Jingcchu.

192
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,530
- But Sheng Jingchu–
- It's all right.

193
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,130
Cheng Liao, I was just about to praise you.

194
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,840
The tournament and all that isn't important. You don't need to interview Sheng Jingchu.

195
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,660
All of the cameras already got you hugging Sheng Jingchu.

196
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,410
You don't need to find news for me. You are the news!

197
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,650
The situation isn't like that.

198
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,110
- Listen to me explain.
 - You don't need to explain.

199
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,930
I saw everything. You did very well.

200
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,460
I'll ask the boss to reward you.

201
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,520
Keep working hard!

202
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,280
You keep stirring the pot. I'm not twice-cooked pork!
(T/N: play on words)

203
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,600
Everyone is your tool for stirring up drama.

204
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,830
[Sheng Jingchu]

205
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,110
"GO God"?

206
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,970
Cheng Liao?

207
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,750
Mr. Sheng.

208
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,650
Mr. Kiyomasa?

209
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,730
Mr. Sheng, please give me some beer.

210
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,380
Mr. Kiyomasa, can I invite you for a drink another day?

211
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,530
This is the most important thing in my life,

212
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,800
so I need to be tipsy before I can tell you.

213
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,020
Beer, please.

214
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,050
Thank you.

215
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,280
Please.

216
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,200
One more.

217
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,050
Please.

218
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,370
What's wrong with Mr. Kiyomasa?

219
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,880
Don't mind him. Go see the flowers first.

220
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
What's wrong with the flowers?

221
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,490
Take a good look at them.

222
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,930
Plants have emotions, too. If they see a fellow flower get plucked,

223
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,300
they'll be sad and die from depression.

224
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,540
Take a good look.

225
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,670
Who did you hear that from?

226
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,830
I found it online.

227
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,490
You're too cute.

228
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,650
It's fine. The flowers are doing great.

229
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,960
So, you chased out evil-flower-plucking Jo Yeon Hoon?

230
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,150
He's not familiar with this place, where will he go?

231
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,210
Jiuzhou.

232
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,650
The series of traps set by Mr. Zhao in the middle was ingenious.

233
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,920
What's so great about that? He lost anyways.

234
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,080
Senior Jing's calmness in the midst of adversity

235
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,350
is what's worthy to be learned by us, understand?

236
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,470
If you were to play against Yeon Hoon-oppa, you would've lost early on.

237
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,580
- I...
- You guys are talking about me?

238
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,690
Oppa!

239
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,860
I'm sorry. The door was unlocked, so I came in.

240
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,000
Wait.

241
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,080
What are you doing here? May I help you?

242
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,070
- Mr. Jo, welcome. Have some fruit.
- Thank you. You're too polite.

243
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,910
Let's eat and chat. If that's not enough, there's more.

244
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,000
Why are you feeding him? I haven't been fed yet. What are you doing here so late?

245
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,170
Actually, I've been sad about losing to Sheng Jingchu this time.

246
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,790
I've heard a lot about Jiuzhou Hall's fame, so I'm here to learn.

247
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,290
Welcome. Welcome.

248
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,000
You came to learn from us in the middle of the night with a suitcase. What? Are you staying overnight?

249
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,720
I can! I can stay here, of course!

250
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,810
This idea of yours is great, Mr. Cao!

251
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,580
I'm just wondering if it's okay with you all?

252
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,830
It's okay! It's okay! We really welcome you!

253
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,340
Stop messing around here.

254
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,950
Our... Our master isn't here. We can't make the decision.

255
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,690
Our master is not here, but Eldest Senior Brother can make a decision.

256
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,150
- Really?
- Eldest Senior Brother must be...
- Great! We welcome you!

257
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,410
- Thank you so much!
- Yes! Yeon Hoon-oppa, I'll take you to the guest room.

258
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,570
Xiao Lan!

259
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,330
- This way.
- This way, please.

260
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,620
- Come, come.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Cao.

261
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,140
- Senior Brother.
- This way.

262
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,350
You brought a wolf into the herd!

263
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,610
No, our country values etiquette and manners.

264
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,380
You should even more so build friendships with fellow GO players.

265
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,530
Jo Yeon Hoon came this far, we have to welcome him.

266
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,500
Be more generous!

267
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,290
Mr. Jo, would you like to try my health tea?

268
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,390
Jo Yeon Hoon... I'll...

269
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,980
Jo Yeon Hoon...!

270
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,670
Hangover tea.

271
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,220
Mr. Sheng, you need to take care of me.

272
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,600
For what?

273
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,120
My lifelong happiness. You need to take care of me!

274
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,800
Sheng Jingchu, what did you do all night?

275
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,260
I didn't do anything to him.

276
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,100
My girlfriend

277
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,040
is also from Binhai. Her name is Xiao Kong.

278
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,460
I've decided a long time ago that she's irreplaceable in my life.

279
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,010
I planned on dedicating the trophy to her

280
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,650
and then at the award ceremony

281
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,430
propose to my dear Kong.

282
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,380
But he ruined my plan

283
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,640
for the proposal.

284
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,660
Ruined?

285
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,050
That's right!

286
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,160
Ruined!

287
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,000
I didn't have a Plan B.

288
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,160
I couldn't come up with a more romantic way to

289
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,490
propose to my dear Kong.

290
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,340
Mr. Sheng, it's all your fault. My lifelong happiness

291
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,920
is your responsibility. You have to take complete responsibility.

292
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,980
Mr. Katou,

293
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,210
I don't know how either.

294
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,650
I don't care. I don't have other friends in China.

295
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,190
You two have to help me!

296
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,760
I'm not good at being romantic.

297
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,140
Don't push me!

298
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,870
For my lifelong happiness,

299
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,170
I will do anything!

300
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,250
Mr. Katou, please calm down.

301
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,550
Just one second.

302
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,290
I believe Mr. Katou is dead set on you.

303
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,780
How about we think of something for him?

304
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,170
Jo Yeon Hoon was first, and then him.

305
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,600
My plan was completely ruined.

306
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,910
What plan did you have?

307
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,640
Nothing. Let's deal with him first.

308
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,600
[Jiuzhou Hall]

309
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,820
So you agreed to help him propose?

310
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,550
Please help me, everyone.

311
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:36,120
Or else, I don't know how to face Xiao Kong. Please, I beg you.

312
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,270
That's not necessary. That's not necessary.

313
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,880
Let's think of something.

314
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,090
Yes, let's.

315
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,820
Think.

316
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,960
Why are you looking at me?

317
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,350
I don't have experience with that either.

318
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:57,290
That's right. None of us have that experience.

319
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,470
To be honest, everyone in this room,

320
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,070
except for Brother Jing and Sister-in-Law,

321
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,130
are single.

322
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,210
We don't have that experience.

323
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,370
How's this?

324
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,140
Jiuzhou has a principle around helping others.

325
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,380
We will definitely help Mr. Katou with his goal.

326
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,450
Thank you. Thank you so much!

327
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,020
Don't mention it. Since we don't have the experience,

328
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,910
I think we should discuss it together.

329
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,050
What do you think? Discussion always solves the problem.

330
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,000
With years of experience of watching dramas,

331
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,860
I think girls like romantic, dreamy proposals.

332
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,190
That's nice, but I think on top of being romantic and dreamy,

333
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,380
you need to add some practical elements. What do you think?

334
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,710
Mr. Katou, I think nostalgia is more of an appropriate style for you.

335
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,350
I think being international is also important.

336
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,780
International won't do. Won't do.

337
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,640
Why not?

338
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,970
You need to go with our traditions, right? This is China.

339
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,880
You need to put some Chinese elements into it.

340
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,440
With your taste, you should give less advice!

341
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,770
What's wrong with my taste? Look at my sweater.

342
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,430
I have... I have... dogs.

343
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,590
Your hair is also problematic. It's like a pot lid.

344
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,980
Your hair is problematic! You look like you are from the 80's and you're talking about me.

345
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,180
You look like Runtu.
(T/N: Runtu is a character in Lu Xun's novel "Hometown".)

346
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,000
I look like Runtu? Do I look like Runtu?

347
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,970
Don't be mad and have them laugh at us.

348
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,480
Let's just discuss the matter and solve the problem. Don't bicker.

349
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,750
- What are they talking about?
- They were just joking.

350
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,580
Don't worry, Mr. Katou. Everything can be solved with some discussion.

351
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,980
Mr. Katou, how about I show you around?

352
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,640
- How's that sound?
- Okay, okay.

353
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,790
- They'll discuss and come up with something.
- All right.

354
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,320
I have a book. In the book...

355
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,440
You all keep discussing.

356
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,350
Do I look like Runtu? Is my hair not cute?

357
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:08,000
It's cute. It's cute. We were talking about the proposal.

358
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,700
Let's be energetic, okay?

359
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,670

He just doesn't sing much, so no one knows about it.

364
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,980
My master said that if someday he doesn't want to play GO anymore,

365
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,850
he can sing on the street and still make a living.

Xiao Kong, I hope you can marry me.

378

I want to take care of you for the rest of your life.

379
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

380
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,400
Oppa, is there a game that you really like to play?

381
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,900
If so, we can play the game together later.

382
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,000
The New Swordsman mobile game? I don't play very well.

383
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,700
But if you play it with me, I think it'll be a lot more fun.

384
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,000
Really? I've been looking for someone to form a team with.

385
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,600
Then let's play it together.

386
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,700
Excuse me.

387
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,300
Here, have a drink.

388
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,800
I quit drinking.

389
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,800
I'll drink it then.

390
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,430
Well...

391
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,600
We came to help Mr. Katou with his proposal today.

392
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,700
But actually, every single person has found something that they wanted to do.

393
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,180
The matter has finally been resolved.

394
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,360
Do you still remember our promise?

395
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,400
What promise?

396
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,800
To take you for a ride.

397
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
A ride?

398
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,400
Seriously? Only you would call this "a ride."

399
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,400
The first time I saw you was on this bus.

400
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,800
Come on.

401
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:31,000
♫ The little sunshine never retreats.
Dispelling all the confusion  ♫

402
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,600
♫ The little sunshine is here every season.
The power in believing  ♫

403
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:43,400
♫ The little sunshine brightens up the road.
We'll tackle all the problems together  ♫

404
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:50,000
♫ Let me think a minute. Think about what tomorrow is like.
The future with you everywhere  ♫

405
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,400
♫ Let me make a scene. Hide in your embrace.
Love is like the never changing sun ♫

406
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:04,100
♫ Half of you, Half of me. As the years quietly trickle on  ♫

407
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:09,200
♫ Not disappointed, not depressed.
The radiance of the two of us ♫

408
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Listen to some songs.

409
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,400
♫ Your bright smile ♫

410
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,100
♫ My heart beats follow ♫

411
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:51,600
♫ Why did I suddenly think about the future? ♫

412
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,500
♫ When we intimately say hello ♫

413
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,200
♫ Our eyes meet ♫

414
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,800
♫ Just like that, I suddenly thought of loving you ♫

415
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,500
♫ Believing the whole world is a rainbow ♫

416
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,800
♫ But it's just black and white ♫

417
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,800
♫ Yet, you allowed me to see the dazzling twinkling  ♫

418
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,200
♫ You're like the gentle breeze in my face ♫

419
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,000
♫ Gently moving about in my blue sky ♫

420
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,800
♫ Like the key to my dreams moving back and forth ♫

421
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,800
♫ That romantic universe ♫

422
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,200
♫ Has given me something completely different ♫

423
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,000
♫ The restless desire of love ♫

424
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,800
♫ Sweet movements matching the other person ♫

425
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,400
♫ Can't help but protect happiness ♫

426
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,400
♫ Suddenly the heart is moved ♫

427
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,000
- Cheng Liao.
- Yes?

428
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,600
Got it.

429
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,780
I have something to tell you.

430
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,200
Go ahead.

431
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,220
Every moment with you...

432
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,400
I feel like time flies by.

433
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,390
It's never enough.

434
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,800
I want to be with you every single moment.

435
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,480
I want to be close to you, to understand you more.

436
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm a boring person. The person you see right now...

437
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,800
isn't perfect. But thankfully, life is a long journey.

438
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,600
I have enough time to better myself.

439
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,200
Perhaps...

440
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
Even in the end, I won't be able to become the person you want.

441
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,010
But I'll try my very best.

442
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,010
Liao Liao.

443
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,300
I...

444
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,950
I've never liked anyone before.

445
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,460
But right now, I'm absolutely sure that...

446
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,380
I like you.

447
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,000
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

448
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

449
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,800
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

450
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,400
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

451
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,400
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

452
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,200
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

453
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,800
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

454
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,800
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

455
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:47,800
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

456
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,800
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

457
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,800
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

458
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,800
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

459
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:34,400
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

460
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,400
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

461
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,000
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

462
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,800
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

463
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,800
♫ There is color all around you ♫

464
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,700
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

465
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,400
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

466
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,400
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

467
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,000
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

468
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,200
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

469
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,200
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

470
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,200
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

471
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,000
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

472
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

473
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,200
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

474
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

475
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:08,000
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
