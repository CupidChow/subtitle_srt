[GO Into Your Heart]

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,000
[Episode 36]

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,980
At this moment out of the four matches, only the match between Cho Shen Woo 9 dan, and Sheng Jingchu 9 dan remains ongoing.

19
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,180
Korean Master Cho Shen Woo's GO style is unexpected and dangerous.

20
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,640
If the opponent gets slightly distracted, they will fall into a trap.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,070
Originally, a highly winnable game becomes a badly lost game. His style is known as the Blade of the Ghost.

22
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,450
Zhiliao, after watching so many Sheng Jingchu matches, this game is a nail-biter.

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,980
Look at this old Korean, his face looks so fierce.

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,860
Lately, Sheng Jingchu has insisted on trying out different game styles.

25
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,790
The reasoning is to become more balanced and not have any shortcomings,

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,360
but the result hasn't been great.

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,980
Zhiliao, why are you practicing yoga during the competition?

28
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,350
I'm saying young lady prayers right now!

29
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,480
If you're so anxious, why don't you go to the venue?

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,560
Do you think I don't want to go? He wouldn't allow me to go!

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,930
Maybe Cho Xianluo has studied Sheng Jingchu's recent matches.

32
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,200
He hasn't been giving Sheng Jingchu any opportunity to show off his strengths.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,270
Up to this point, Sheng Jingchu also hasn't shown any of his strikes or counterattacks.

34
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,400
He's very passive at the moment.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,880
Currently, Cho Xianluo is leading this game. According to the AI's prediction,

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,200
the black stones have an 80% chance of winning. If Sheng Jingchu can't think of any ideas

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,540
then he'll be out in the first round once again.

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,670
The black stones are taking all the white stones.

39
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,680
Cho Xianluo is very confident in his own game strategy.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,550
His game will determine the life and death of this match.

41
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,890
It looks like Cho Shen Woo was blinded by this two-step move that blocked all the black stones.

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,080
Sheng Jingchu used this unbelievable move

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,610
that showed incredible skill and turned the game around.

44
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,490
The move happened quietly and miraculously.

45
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,270
The scale between winning and losing has become more balanced.

46
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,390
Sheng Jingchu, 9th dan wins!

47
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,730
He won! He won! He won!

48
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,030
Sheng Jingchu finally won! He found his own way to win the match!

49
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,730
My son-in-law is so awesome! He really didn't let the Chinese people down!

50
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,950
Let me prepare two dishes and deliver them to him right away.

51
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,210
Dad, don't go. I've already thought of a way to celebrate.

52
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,080
Because of this move, every move with your white stones came into effect.

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,580
Sheng Jingchu, you played very well here.

54
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,520

In order to celebrate your triumphant return, applause!

65
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,030
It was difficult to make, wasn't it?

66
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,940
Not hard! You just sprinkle the pea flour evenly on top of the shaved ice,

67
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,610
and then you draw the squares with chocolate sauce.

You can even play a few moves before you eat it.

69

I've decided to name it...

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,580
"Prosperous Tian Yuan."
(T/N: The center point on the GO board.)

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,120
Of course not!

75
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,070
Isn't that what dating is?

76
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,090
Things that you clearly can do yourself,

77
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,120
but you only feel happy when the other party does it for you.

78

You played GO the whole day today. Your hands are tired. You have to rest.

By the way, Cao Xihe.

85
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,620
I've thought about this a long time, but I couldn't wrap my head around it.

86
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,530
When you'd compete with me in the past, you'd always lose inexplicably.

87
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,960
How were you so good today?

88
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,930

What are you guys doing?

90
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,300
Because when I competed with you in the past,

91
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,370
I put all my focus on your face. I wasn't even paying attention to the GO board.

92
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,970
What's wrong with my face?

93
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,020
You were my number one virtual crush in the past,

94
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,680
so whenever he saw you, he'd study your face to try and understand what there was to like about it.

95
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,780
- You knew about this?!
- Of course.

96
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,060
Then, why didn't you help solve this problem for me earlier?

97
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,360
Before, I thought you were in weird spirits,

98
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,280
so even though I knew about it, I didn't know how to help you solve it.

99
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,150
Then am I in better spirits now?

100
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,490
Now, you're the number one boyfriend in the world.

101
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,760

Jo Yeon Hoon, I beat you to today.

112
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,300
You wouldn't dare look down on me in the future, right?

113
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,250
Actually, I was aware of your strength a long time ago.

114
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,360
But I didn't know why every time you encountered me, you were like a...

115
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,190
like a...

116
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,910
- A fool?
- Fool?
(T/N: He said "fool" in Korean.)

117
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,050
- Fool.
- Fool.

118
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,590
You're the one who's a fool! A big fool!

119
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,770
I know that one.

120
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,560
So every time before a match, I would...

121
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,260
What's that in Chinese again?

122
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,510
To provoke you! So I could bring out your fighting spirit!

123
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,980
Chinese is way too hard.

124
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,490
So every time you irritated me it was for my sake. Looks like I should thank you instead.

125
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,670
Of course, you should thank me. You improved a lot.

126
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,100
- Should we reconcile?
- Hold on.

127
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,810
Jo Yeon Hoon, you kept hiding that you had a girlfriend before. How are you going to account for that?

128
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,120
That's a misunderstanding.

129
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,220
Xiao Lan, perhaps a young girl like you wouldn't understand.

130
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,720
But I was protecting my girlfriend.

131
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,420
As you know, a guy as handsome as me,

132
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,170
tall... and with a great physique,

133
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,940
and rich...

134
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,170
If my superfans were to find out that I had a girlfriend, then my girlfriend would get attacked.

135
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,480
How sad would that be? What a headache? So I'm protecting her, understood?

136
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,040
Understood?
(T/N: speaking in Korean)

137
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,050
I think I understand a little bit. But can I believe him?

138
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,620
I believe him.

139
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,190
All attractive and popular idols like us encounter problems like these.

140
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,660
Xiao Lan, I'll definitely protect you well in the future.

141
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,560
I'll thank you then.

142
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,850
Come. We're reconciled.

143
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,210
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

144
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,160
This is so nice.

145
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,340
When I see them, I'm reminded of our past.

146
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,790
Rumei, shall we find our missing time from the past?

147
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,920
Here, cheers.

148
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,360
What's so funny?

149
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,900
The meat is ready, eat. Hurry up.

150
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,160
Xie Chang'an is the GO Love God. Today was a day full of miracles.

151
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,980
In the first round match at the China-Korea GO Invitational Tournament, there were a lot of reversals in strategy.

152
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,580
The biggest upset of the one who waited 10 years for his love to return,

153
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,480
which reinvigorated and led him to a victory over Yao Ke, 9th dan,

154
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,510
which was Jiuzhou Hall's Senior Brother Xie Chang'an.

00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,730
Brother, stop sitting on the floor. It's cold on the floor.

156
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,570
Xiao Pu...

157
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,530
I actually lost to Xie Chang'an.

158
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,950
Stop thinking about it! This match was just an outlier, that's all.

159
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,130
Xiao Pu, do you know?

160
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,930
For the past few hours,

161
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,370
I've been reviewing the journey of my professional career.

162
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,140
Before, I'd found glory on the GO boards,

163
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,230
I had maintained years of consecutive wins.

164
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,820
For all the young GO players, I was an insurmountable hurdle,

165
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,740
someone they couldn't touch.

166
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,000
- I know, Brother.
- Until Sheng Jingchu showed up.

167
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,140
He's just like a barrier,

168
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,150
stubbornly blocking me!

169
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,540
But recently, recently he's had consecutive losses.

170
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,550
I know I have a chance now. I have a chance to overcome this barrier!

171
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,060
I can reach my peak. I'm this close. This close, Xiao Pu.

172
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,500
- Brother, don't be like this. I know. I know, I know it all.
- Xie Chang'an.

173
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,960
Xie Chang'an.

174
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,010
The one who had been eliminated in the first round of all major competitions in the past ten years,

175
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,870
Xie Chang'an.

176
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,530
Brother.

177
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,870
Timing, fortune, and luck.

178
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,500
At Jiuzhou, in the world of GO,

179
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,090
my image and my dignity

180
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,810
have been completely exhausted.

181
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,670
But Jingchu, why is Sheng Jingchu able to win against Cho Shen Woo?!

182
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,770
Why are the heavens doing this to me?

183
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,260
Xiao Pu, tell me. Why? Why?!

184
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,600
Tell me!

185
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,570
Brother, don't be like this.

186
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,580
Liao Liao, I have a really important interview tomorrow

187
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,680
that I need to go to. I just wanted to let you know.

188
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,360
Didn't you say you'd only take my interviews? Why are you still going to someone else's?

189
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,500
- You're fickle.
- This person,

190
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,380
you wouldn't let me go.

191
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,470
- Who?
- Your older sister.

192
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,540
In regards to your consecutive losses in the prior period,

193
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,230
your GO admirers and fans were all quite shocked.

194
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,330
The outside world also had many differing opinions.

195
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,000
So, Mr. Sheng, what do you have to say about it?

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,020
Since I was young, my objective in GO had been simple.

197
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,180
Win against those who are better than me.

198
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,580
But now, I've changed my perspective.

199
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,160
Instead, I think GO should elevate your personal state.

200
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,730
It's the most direct expression of your frame of mind.

201
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,890
You can't only think about winning or losing.

202
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,210
So I've been trying out a new way of playing GO.

203
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,620
So the previous mishaps were also due to your self-introspection?

204
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,990
Then for this invitational, you won against Cho Shen Woo, 9th dan,

205
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,930
and successfully entered the top 4. Can we understand this as

206
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,750
you have successfully completed your inner search?

207
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,910
On this point, my master helped me a lot.

208
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,500
He let me find a new direction and showed me what paths to take.

209
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Actually, GO isn't just a game between two players.

210
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,600
There are many other factors that may influence a player's state of mind.

211
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,210
If you care too much about winning or losing, you could lose even more quickly.

212
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,080
I've found something very interesting lately.

213
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,130
Recently on the internet, people have been saying that you've changed.

214
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,900
Maybe before, the vibe you gave off

215
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,150
was more cold and distant.

216
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,420
But now after dating, you've become more and more down-to-earth.

217
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,730
Some people even ridiculed you by saying that you're a loving brain.

218
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,560
Have you heard about this?

219
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,730
What's a "loving brain?"

220
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,200
It means someone who, after beginning a relationship, will put a lot more energy

221
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,610
and time into their significant other

222
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,270
and then neglect a lot of other things as a result.

223
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,700
Such as your competition, for example.

[Pinecone Video]
[To be ambitious and unafraid is the counterattack of some talented GO players]

225
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,880
Then I am a "loving brain."

226
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,810
He owns up to his actions. A real man.

227
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,230
We already discussed before he left

228
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,870
to not directly answer relationship questions.

229
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,920
Why isn't he answering as we rehearsed?

230
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,900
It could be like everyone's saying, I'm not as cold as I was before.

231
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,620
Because someone appeared in my world.

232
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,760
She used her enthusiasm

233
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,360
to warm me up, to change me.

234
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,270
A lot of people say that dating has hurt my performance.

235
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,580
It's not like that.

236
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,740
That I'm able to win

237
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,840
is in large part due to my girlfriend.

238
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,710
When no one else believed in me,

239
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,460
she firmly supported me and stayed by my side.

240
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,760
Even though she received a lot of hate on the internet,

241
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,920
she would pretend like she was okay.

242
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,070
She would use her most brilliant smile

243
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,460
to encourage me to stick to my beliefs.

244
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,620
No matter whether if I won or lost, she would make me lots of elaborate and delicious foods.

245
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,750
The food she makes has the power to heal hearts.

246
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,320
She's helped me experience happiness.

247
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,190

Mr. Sheng, good work today.

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,170
I won't say much more.

257
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,890
I sincerely thank you for accepting our interview.

258
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,130
And thank you for letting me say the things I've been wanting to say.

Why did you come here?

260
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,660
She definitely didn't come to pick me up.

261
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,530
What? I just borrowed your boyfriend for a few hours to record a show, that's all.

262
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,910
You couldn't help it, and came to pick him up?

263
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,630
The next time you take him, let me know first.

264
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,900
Let's go.

265
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,640
We're going. Bye-bye.

- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

267
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,910
They're really a young couple that's easy on the eyes.

268
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,860
Zhiliao being able to find someone so genuine and devoted to her is wonderful.

I'm happy for her.

Anchorwoman Cheng isn't bad, either.

271

With your talent, why don't you find someone to be by your side as well?

Vice President Xu, stop teasing me.

273

It wasn't until I came to Pinecone Video that I realized just how many girls are secretly crushing on you.

274
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,680
Why don't you pick one of them?

275

Don't try to redirect the topic to me.

Sheng Jingchu’s live interview, the viewership once again reached a new high.

281
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,880
You're definitely the golden headliner at our Pinecone Video.

282
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,440
It’s because Sheng Jingchu decided to share his heartfelt emotions on the show.

283
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,410
The viewers were moved by Zhiliao and his love story.

284
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,690
This interview is meant to be explosive.

285
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,720
There's very little to do with me as a host.

286
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,940
But without you, Sheng Jingchu wouldn't appear on Pinecone Video's platform, right?

287
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,930
Let say I took advantage of Zhiliao‘s connection.

288
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,730
- That’s not what I meant.
- It’s not a big deal even if it was.

289
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,310
The fact is, Sheng Jingchu is my sister’s boyfriend.

290

Also, Zhiliao and I being able to help each other out

291
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,450
is a good thing.

292
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,320
Xiao Yi, I feel like you're somewhat…

293
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,290
different.

294
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,680
What’s different?

295
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,790
I can’t put my finger on it. I just feel like...

296
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,060
you're more open and direct.

297
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,050
It feels like the person who was always wound up and on alert for anything

298
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,450
has completely relaxed.

299
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,010
Really?

300
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,520
I don’t remember a time when you'd rely on your sister and so willingly, too.

You should go home and get some rest.

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,570
Have some.

312
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,410
Why don’t you eat?

313
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,350
I'm seeing stars after working all day.

314
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,480
Now seeing you here, I instantly feel so much better.

315
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,780
Do you know why…

316
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,530
your brain hurts?

317
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,610
You're hungry. Hurry up and eat.

318
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,230
Here.

319
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,950
Whenever I focused on GO, I forgot everything else.

320
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,540
How are the results from your recent competitions?

321
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,870
5 consecutive wins.

322
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,260
It's going pretty well!

323
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,290
It's not smooth though.

324
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,480
Each opponent is particularly strong and talented.

325
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,330
My physical and mental strength are both being attacked.

326
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,430
But I can't be a disgrace to my master.

327
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,270
What's more so, I can't let you down.

328
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,990
But today, you being able to eat with me,

329
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,280
just with this one meal,

330
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,650
I'll definitely be able to keep going.

331
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,250
Eat slowly. Nobody's fighting you for it.

332
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,090
The more I say, the more excited you're getting. Slow down.

333
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,820
What are you doing?

334
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,750
I liked to eat cotton candy a lot as a kid.

335
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,480
I remember every time we went out to play, my dad would always buy me some.

336
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,910
Sorry, sorry.

337
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,450
We didn't want to bother you.

338
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,720
However, the two of you together were so sweet. We couldn't help it.

339
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,920
I'll delete it right now.

340
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,780
- Okay.
- It's al...

341
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,390
It's all right. If you took the picture, then go ahead and keep it.

342
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,190
Just don't post them online, all right?

343
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,890
Don't worry! I'll treasure it for myself. I definitely won't spread it.

344
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,330
Yuan Bao, after I saw the interview today, I realized that Cheng Liao really treats you well.

345
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,970
You mustn't let her down.

346
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,460
Of course.

347
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,090
Bye-bye.

348
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,490
Why didn't you go with what we discussed?

349
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,580
Didn't you say, we were going to dodge those dating questions as much as possible?

350
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,460
You were going to talk about how you were intensively studying a new GO style

351
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,760
and the efforts you put into improving your GO patterns and level.

352
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,690
Because of them.

353
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,990
You're saying because of your fan's comments.

354
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:47,300
I thought I had excellent acting skills trying to pretend that I was okay.

355
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,500
Your acting skills are indeed good.

356
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,680
It was just that little bit and I was almost fooled by it.

357
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,030
How did you find out?

358
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,480
Hey!

359
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,040
I was only training GO in seclusion, I didn't go back to the Stone Age.

360
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,430
Moreover, the first thing I do every morning

361
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,560
was watch your video.

362
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,910
To see if the views increased.

363
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,620
So then those bullet comments and online messages, I naturally saw them.

364
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,400
Then, I really did miscalculate it.

365
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,260
I had thought I had excellent acting skills.

366
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,740
But I didn't expect that the acting emperor was right here with me.

367
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,910
But aren't you also the same way?

368
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,880
Afraid that I would lose focus and be worried, so you pretended as nothing happened.

369
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,620
I should award you a small gold person.
 (T/N: Referring to the Oscar.)

370
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,740
Actually, I saw them a long time ago already.

371
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,130
The online criticism and slander towards you.

372
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,220
But if I told you before the competition,

373
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,640
you'd probably be worried about me and blame yourself.

374
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,570
So I pretended that I didn't know anything.

375
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,040
So why didn't you keep pretending you didn't know?

376
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,850
On the program today, you even said...

377
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,420
said you were a loving brain.

378
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,490
What if they didn't understand?

379
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,230
How can I watch you be treated unfairly and not say anything about it?

380
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,220
So I had to tell them.

381
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,590
Even if they don't understand,

382
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,280
they wouldn't be able to blindly blame you.

383
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,560
Eat some sugar.

384
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,210
Why is my head so dizzy? It's too dizzy.

385
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,510
Too dizzy.

386
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,680
Where are you dizzy? Where is it hurting? Let me know so I can massage it for you.

387
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,090
My head is dizzy. My neck really hurts. My neck can't exert any strength.

388
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,080
Your neck, right? Okay, let me massage it for you.

389
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,670
Ahh, it hurts, it hurts. You're killing me!

390
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,540
Are you awake now?

391
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,940
- I'm awake. 200% awake.
- Are you still feeling dizzy?

392
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,010
I'm feeling really refreshed and alert. I can even play a round of GO right now.

393
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,440
See if you dare drink that much next time.

394
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,180
You can't blame it on me.

395
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,320
Jo Yeon Hoon was getting all worked up because he lost the game.

396
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,570
I beat him in GO. I can't lose to him drinking, either. Whose afraid of whom?

397
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,470
Childish.

398
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,100
How can you say I'm childish? Last night's hangover was so uncomfortable,

399
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,700
but it didn't stop me from getting my beloved girlfriend a spot at an online trending cafe.

400
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,800
Where can you find such a good boyfriend? You should be satisfied.

401
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,720
All right, you're the best.

402
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,580
It wasn't easy to beat Jo Yeon Hoon, it's possible you'll make the semifinals.

403
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,790
During your rest and recovery period, you're not allowed to drink anymore. Got it?

404
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,090
I got it.

405
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,440
Hey, who do you want to play against during the semifinals?

406
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,930
When it comes to Master, the later in the finals I can play him the better.

407
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,940
- Then, Eldest Senior Brother?
- Forget it, forget about it.

408
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,580
Sister Rumei is back now. His seal is finally removed and he can even beat Junior Brother Yao Ke.

409
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,880
If I play against him, I won't be able to predict his tactics.

410
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,310
It would be better to play a game against the adjusting and unstable Senior Brother Jing.

411
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,050
Senior Brother He, do you want to consider switching jobs and becoming a fortuneteller?

412
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,700
Why?

413
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,660
Just because you jinxed yourself.

I'm looking for a store.

Actually when it comes to Rumei,

420
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,530
my heart has always had a big regret.

421
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,580
How do I get you to meet me

at the point that I'm the most attractive?

423
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,360
For this, I've already been praying to Buddha for over 500 years.

424
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,250
For Buddha to let me tie the knot on an inseparable bond.

425
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,470
As a result, Buddha turned me into a tree

Each flower is a yearning of my past life.

I was planning on the next day

446
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,950
to confess to her with the trophy at the noodle shop. But I didn't expect

that I missed Rumei's call.

448

00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,790
[Jiuzhou Hall]

468
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,540
Sister Cheng Liao, I think our eldest senior brother

469
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,340
is too pitiful.

470
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,570
Sister-in-Law, we've thought it over and over,

471
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,640
but this is about food,

472
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,270
so we still need to ask you for help.

473
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,230
Too pitiful. Ten years.

474
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,010
How many ten years can one have?

475
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,540
- Are you two trying to bribe me?
- No, no.

476
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,710
You even play a sad drama.

477
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,280
Isn't it just a bowl of Macheng fish noodles? Does it have to go this far?

478
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,850
During this time when the semifinals are taking a break,

479
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,570
I'll take care of it beautifully.

480
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,860
Make sure that Eldest Senior Brother can compete without distraction.

481
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,140
You can eat it.

482
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,550
- I'm leaving.
- Sister Cheng Liao, you're so righteous!

483
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,450
- I'll give you a ride.
- Take this!

484
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,440
- That's how you took this matter on.
- Yes.

485
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,100
- But...
- No more buts. Think about it.

486
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,290
First, I can help Eldest Senior Brother fulfill his old wish.

487
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,580
Second, I can help Macheng fish noodles revive themselves.

488
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,220
Third, I'll have learned a new dish.

489
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,330
Kills three with one stone. Isn't it that good?

490
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,980
It's truly killing three with one stone, but you also should consider the overall situation.

491
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,000
First, who can you learn noodle making from in such a short time?

492
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,750
Second, even if you learn how to make noodles,

493
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,730
how can you guarantee that it'll taste the same as the original?

494
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,180
Third, the noodle house is already gone.

495
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,800
How will you help Eldest Senior Brother find the original ambiance and feelings?

496
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,400
The ambiance is easy. Remember who I am now.

497
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,740
I'm the second-generation owner of the Cheng Restaurant.

498
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,710
I can restore my restaurant to the original look anytime.

499
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,750
As for who to learn from,

500
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,390
I'll just use my network connections, that's all.

501
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,890
Little girl Cheng, this one's truly difficult this time.

502
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,510
I used my primordial energy to find

503
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,120
the photo of the original look inside and outside of the restaurant.

504
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,050
I even found the old boss' photo.

505
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:53,040
But about the boss, there's no clue as to where to find him at all.

506
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,640
Here, Yan Xiao. You worked overtime and haven't eaten, right? Eat some dumplings.

507
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,520
Thanks, Uncle.

508
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,430
It has a vegetarian filling. Don't look down on it, it's especially delicious.

509
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,740
- If you eat one, you'll want to eat two. When you eat two, you'll want to eat three.
- I really like eating these.

510
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,530
Zhiliao, you eat some too.

511
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,100
Encyclopedia, if we take

512
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,600
these photos to ask the old neighbors nearby,

513
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,590
would they know where he moved to?

514
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,480
I think it's been too long already.

515
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,350
Isn't that Old Fang?

516
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,390
Dad, you know him?!

517
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,930
That's right, Old Fang.

518
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,690
He used to run the Macheng Fish Noodle restaurant. That store was very popular at that time.

519
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,210
In today's term, online trending store. I especially went there and stood in line for a whole afternoon.

520
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,570
I almost passed out in line. I really remember this well.

521
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,430
Uncle, in order to eat good food you're quite persistent.

522
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,380
You're joking. How else did our Zhiliao get her foodie genes?

523
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,500
Listen. I wanted to learn at that time.

524
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,180
But after I ate it, I still didn't learn anything.

525
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,600
But, Dad, why did such a popular noodle shop close up later?

526
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,350
Old Fang... later... got Parkinson's disease.

527
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:59,370
Uncle, is there a way to find him?

528
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,530
Let's do this. I'll wield the power of my old friend's circle.

529
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,190
Let me help you look. Wait a moment.

530
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,850
Thank you!

531
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,260
Yan Xiao, why are you here?

532
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,860
Sister Yi.

533
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,260
So that's what it's about.

534
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,420
Sis, don't you think,

535
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,740
for such a touching love story,

536
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,350
shouldn't we help Eldest Senior Brother no matter what

537
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,080
to fulfill this void in his heart?

538
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,510
I'll join your plan, too.

539
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,800
Does your reaction have to be so exaggerated?

540
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,870
I said I want to join. It's not a sudden impulse or joining in for fun.

541
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,540
I'm being serious.

542
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,390
Actually, I originally came to Pinecone Video

543
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,840
to give Cheng Yi Conversation a good ending.

544
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,610
Now, the program has officially been over for a while.

545
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:16,390
I've been wanting to plan a new program that belongs to me at Pinecone Video.

546
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,890
I just haven't found the appropriate theme yet.

547
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,820
I understand.

548
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,690
Eldest Senior Brother's story has inspired you.

549
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,370
You'll do something that's about love and food.

550
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:32,700
Actually, to be more accurate, it's your Mr. Sheng

551
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,990
who gave me inspiration when he spoke in that interview.

552
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,030
I suddenly realized that food, feelings,

553
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:45,060
memory, between the three of these things, there's a subtle and close connection.

554
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,670
There's a feeling of... the power of healing.

555
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,950
I was still thinking about this when I was working overtime.

556
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,800
I also thought of a good name on the way back.

557
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,500
What's the name, Sister Yi?

558
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,550
The Taste of Memories.

559
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,830
It just happens to perfectly match Eldest Senior Brother Xie Chang'an's story.

560
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,660
I think this new program,

561
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,610
if it gets broadcasted,

562
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,590
the first ideal guest of honor will be him.

563
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,310
That's good, but Eldest Senior Brother might not want it to be so public.

564
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,690
- We must think of a way.
- Zhiliao.

565
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,420
Zhiliao?

566
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,190
- I've found it!
- Really?

567
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,980
- Let me see.
- Look, look.

568
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,140
Come see. Is that the one?

569
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,370
Wow, Dad, you're too amazing!

570
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,340
You're good, Chef Cheng!

571
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,660
Zhiliao, starting now, we'll handle two different operations.

572
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,650
You should immediately learn cooking from Master Fang.

573
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,900
Yan Xiao, the two of us will immediately start working on the plan for the new program.

574
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,210
Yes, Sir, Madam!

575
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,450
And the most important matter is,

576
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:52,020
persuade Eldest Senior Brother Xie Chang'an to appear in our program.

577
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,660
Yay!

578
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,710
Okay.

579
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:38,100
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

580
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,150
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

584
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,530
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

585
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,850
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

586
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:07,030
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

587
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:12,830
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

588
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:18,080
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

589
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,860
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

590
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:38,220
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

591
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:59,630
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

592

♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

593
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,150
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

594
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,970
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

595
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,840
♫ There is color all around you ♫

596
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,850
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

597
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,390
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

598
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,550
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

599
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:42,280
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

600
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,290
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

603
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:02,250
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

604
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:08,110
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

605
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:13,320
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

606
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,150
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

607
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:35,740
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
