[Episode 34]

18
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,480
Today, the national GO tournament has started in Nanjing.

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,990
All the well-known players in the country will be at the match.

20
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,690
This is Sheng Jinchu, 9th dan, and Yao Ke, 9th dan...

21
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,460
Zhiliao, you don't go along to Sheng Jingchu's matches anymore?

22
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,700
Our panda has great prospects now, he doesn't need me to worry about him.

23
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,450
Also, this is a team competition.

24
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,700
There definitely won't be a problem.

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,840
But before, you didn't miss a single competition of Sheng Jingchu's.

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,150
In just this amount of time, your relationship is already in a dull stage?

27
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,270
The two of us are not in a dull stage.

28
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,540
Can't you see that I'm working on my own career?

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,560
I have to become an independent woman.

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,980
Okay. Go for it!

31
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,430
Dad, shouldn't you support me somehow?

32
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,160
Take those family recipes and transfer them to me?

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,150
No way. A man can't pass them to a woman.

34
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,540
What do you mean by that?

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,440
I want to teach Sheng Jingchu how to cook. So that he can make food for you.

[National GO Tournament - Nanjing Competition]

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,570
You must maintain your morale.

38
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,740
Don't worry, Senior Brother. I've smashed the fifth dan, a sixth dan is just around the corner.

39
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,660
- Soon, soon, soon.
- Soon, soon!

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,600
Xiao Ke, don't feel too burdened. Loosen up.

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,590
- Relax, relax, relax.
- Relax, relax.

42
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,810
Hey, Senior Brother.

43
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,640
More than our Junior Brother Yao Ke, the person who worries us most is you.

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,710
Oh, please.

45
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,040
Good luck!

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,260
What are you doing?!

47
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,690
I... I just want to beat some vitality into him.

48
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,600
You didn't beat vitality into him, you knocked the vitality out of him.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,560
Okay, enough. I'm fine. I'm fine. Same as always...

65
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,000
Sheng Jinchu, 9th dan's opening move today is extremely interesting.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,570
This unrestrained move is very imaginative.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,200
The white pieces have gained quite a bit of territory.

68
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,920
The black pieces are exerting influence on the outside, quite magnificent.

69
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,540
If I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes, it would be hard to believe that it's Sheng Jingchu playing GO.

70
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,630
The current situation for the black pieces is very difficult. Sheng Jingchu remains in a precarious position and continues to persist.

71
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,540
No way. He's...

72
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,690
Why is he playing like that?

73
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,880
He's going to lose?

74
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,490
Hey, Senior Brother. You finished your game quickly.

75
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,780
Why is Senior Brother Jing's match like this, so passive?

76
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,440
This pace of opening isn't the way that Jingchu is good at.

77
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,370
It's like he's physically sitting there, but his mind isn't there.

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,200
It's not the Jingchu we're familiar with.

79
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,060
The way I see it, this time Senior Jingchu is searching for something different than before.

80
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,000
He's focusing on developing the center area, but on a large scale, resisting the other side.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,540
Maintaining a complete balance.

82
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,550
Yao Ke, you're worthy of being a 9th dan. You talk just like Master.

83
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,420
Oh, by the way,

84
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,580
Master just called me and especially asked me to watch the two of you.

85
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,900
He wants you two to focus are your own matches. Whether there's a win or not,

86
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,130
no one is allowed to run to Jingchu to bother him with questions. Got it?

87
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,370
Did you hear me?

88
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,520
- Oh no! He's really going to lose!
- He lost!

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,200
Liang Jinyuan, 5th dan, wins.

90
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,510
He really lost?

91
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,910
Old Cheng, isn't your son-in-law supposed to be quite amazing?

92
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,240
Why did he lose? And when he lost, he didn't seem all that upset.

93
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,680
His smile seems perfectly natural. Look.

94
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,660
Did he underestimate his opponent? Isn't taking this competition seriously?

95
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,620
That's not possible. Sheng Jingchu is also human.

96
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,250
So what if he loses occasionally? Who hasn't had a strange day before?

97
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,830
I just think it was too strange.

98
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,900
- Right?
- Yes.
- Just like that rigged football game.

99
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,680
What are you saying?! Do you know that you're insulting the art?

100
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,430
Tell me. Can't you be more tolerant and forgiving?

101
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,100
Don't you know that in ancient times, GO was an art form,

102
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,880
in the same rank as playing the zither, calligraphy, and painting?

103
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,000
GO players were all artists!

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,190
Master would never take his own craft and turn it into a sham.

105
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,530
Master might lose a game of GO,

106
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,730
but I believe Master would spare no effort for GO and for this competition.

107
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,310
- I won't let you drink here.
- Hey, hey.
- Same with you guys, don't drink anymore.

108
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,850
- Hey.
- Why is he acting like this?

109
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,470
You brat. Why are you talking like you ate gunpowder?

110
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,340
Old Zhang, I'm not trying to criticize you.

111
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,270
Why do you always have to say so much?

112
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,210
- I beat Sheng Jingchu!
- Sir, what are you thinking right now?

113
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,970
- You're so happy. How did you beat Sheng Jingchu?
- I'm so excited. Really.

114
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,270
What are your plans now?

115
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,010
- Mr. Sheng.
- Mr. Sheng.

116
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,650
- Your normal style is to fight a quick battle and win quickly, why did you suddenly use a method you normally don't use?
- Hey!

117
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,820
Can you tell us the reason?

118
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,560
Mr. Sheng, today when you started this game,

119
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,910
you made unexpected plays. Is that because of some external factors that influenced you and caused you to make mistakes?

120
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,350
Losing is just losing. There are no external reasons.

121
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,800
- Mr. Sheng!
- Mr. Sheng!

122
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,270
Liao Liao.

123
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,950
Panda, did you sleep poorly or not eat properly?

124
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,170
You just wait. I'm about to buy a ticket and come see you.

125
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,300
What do you want to eat?

126
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,460
Orange soda cake? Or Sister-in-Law Song's fish stew?

127
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,440
I'm fine.

128
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,780
You lost and you're still saying you're fine.

129
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,070
Didn't you say that you wanted me to be calm?

130
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,200
It's no big deal if I lose.

131
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,390
I can eat cake as usual. At worst,

132
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,890
you can turn into my fox.

133
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,480
This time, your opponent wasn't someone high ranked.

134
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,640
Even the commentator said so. You didn't play that game like you usually do.

135
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,960
Panda,

136
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,980
if something's happened to you, you have to tell me.

137
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,160
You can't hide it from me.

138
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,120
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

139
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,660
Liao Liao, what they said is true.

140
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,310
I didn't play that game like I usually do.

141
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,960
The Sheng Jingchu you originally knew could have indeed won that game easily. But the question is...

142
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,610
my current state of mind is completely different from before.

143
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,520
Because... I met you.

144
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,450
Me?

145
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,160
Yes.

146
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,340
You opened my heart and mind.

147
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,420
You took me by the hand and pulled me out of that sealed-off circle I lived in.

148
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,790
You let me see all the colors in this world again.

149
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,320
If they say life is a game of GO,

150
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,950
then before I met you,

151
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,880
my GO board only had GO pieces;

152
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,610
only wins and losses.

153
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,900
I stubbornly believed that if I lost, I'd have nothing left.

Fortunately, his team chose a round robin instead of elimination style competition.

169
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,570
I believe after adjusting his thinking, Sheng Jingchu, whose abilities can't be doubted,

170

will behave as the pillar of the team and lead Jiuzhou to victory.

- Grand Master.

 (T/N: You really know how to jinx things.)

307
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,040
Eldest Senior Brother,

308
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,580
this is too difficult.

309
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,130
Maybe this is Heaven's trial for you.

310
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,720
And Xiao Lan?

311
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,630
She definitely won't want to see you right now.

312
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,380
Let's go.

313
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,750
Enough, enough. Let's go practice GO.

314
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,260
Okay.

315
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,110
You won't feel bad when you start practicing GO. Let's go, let's go.

316
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,380
- Let's go.
- Eldest Senior Brother.

317
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,020
Eldest Senior Brother, who have I offended?

318
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,180
It wasn't easy to finally see Xiao Lan getting close to becoming a 7th dan.

319
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,380
But she had to run into me for the quarter-finals.

320
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,610
What kind of difficult trial did Heaven have to choose?

321
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,870
So what do you want to do then? You're not going to deliberately go easy on her, are you?

322
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,580
If I lose one game, it doesn't mean I'm deliberately going easy on her.

323
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,340
You're still talented, but you lose often, too. Right?

324
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:24,080
My loss is really from me fighting against myself.

325
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,290
I can't concentrate when I compete.

326
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,230
But I don't neglect the spirit of the game of GO in the slightest.

327
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,110
I certainly don't deliberately want to lose to the opponent.

328
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,120
It's because I know everyone has trained hard.

329
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,450
Only when you apply your full strength to compete, that's giving the highest respect to the opponent and to yourself.

330
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,330
Otherwise, regardless of the reason,

331
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,970
you're only being condescending and arrogant.

333

He appears to be in danger.

This is a crucial time for you to die and for me to live.

- Cao Xihe,

348
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,970
you'd better get clear on this. We're competing right now. I'm your opponent.

But I'm feeling frightened.

Give me a bottom line so that my heart can prepare.

Who are you looking down on? Do you think I'll surely lose?

I didn't mean that.

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,700
To make time go by slower.

464
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,790
Indeed you look quite young.

465
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,600
I drink nurturing teas.

466
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,000
But I've thrown them all away already.

467
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,430
All these years...

468
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,050
my heart has always been a mess.

469
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,930
I didn't know when I'd see you again.

470
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,440
I was afraid that when I saw you again,

471
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,090
I'd be so old beyond recognition.

472
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,680
What about your GO game?

473
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,460
Is it still like before?

474
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,660
When you were invincible in all the matches?

475
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,830
Eat some fruit.

476
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,680
- You can ride a bicycle now?
- My teacher taught me well.

477
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,020
Get on.

478
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,280
Sit tight.

479
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:33,830
♫ The wind blows, the moonlight breaks
through the sea of clouds ♫

480
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,780
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

481
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,210
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

482
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,980
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

483
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,930
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

484
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,880
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

485
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,400
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

486
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,620
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

487
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:08,460
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

488
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:14,350
♫ That life is like a butterfly,
breaking out of the cocoon and flying far because of your talent ♫

489
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,600
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

490
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:33,800
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

491
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:55,140
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

492
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,190
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

493
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,660
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

494
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,490
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

495
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,540
♫ There is color all around you ♫

496
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,400
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

497
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,000
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

498
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,200
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

499
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:37,680
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

500
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,000
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

501
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,880
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

502
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,600
♫ That life is like a butterfly,
breaking out of the cocoon and flying far because of your talent ♫

503
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,890
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

504
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:03,750
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

505
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:09,970
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

506
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,630
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

507
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:29,660
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
