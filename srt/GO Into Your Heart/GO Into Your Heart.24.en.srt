00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,600
Wow.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,100
There really is good tacit understanding!

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,440
Sorry, you can't enter.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,560
Hi, can you give this medicine to Sheng Jingchu? He's got a bit of an allergy.

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,860
- Okay.
- Thanks.

24
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,190
Hi, she said that you're allergic and wanted you to take some medicine.

25
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,370
Superb! Sheng Jingchu is truly amazing.

26
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,760
Previously it was one stone relieves two stones from peril. Now it's one stone to determine the kingdom.

27
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,660
This move helped two of Black's key stones.

28
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,720
Yao Ke must feel really bad right now. If I were White, I would feel bad too.

I really ache for 9-dan Yao Ke.

31
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,720
I salute both players here.

32
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,450
Thank you for presenting a fantastic battle.

33
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,890
Victory!

34
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,320
Victory!

35
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,500
Wonderful! Wonderful!

36
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,330
What are we celebrating? Yao Ke is also our fellow disciple.

37
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,880
We should feel sad, right?

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,890
I was just following Xiao Lan.

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,140
I saw Senior Brother He jump up just now.

40
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,840
So I jumped up too.

41
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,830
I heard Eldest Senior Brother shout, so... I couldn't help it.

Mr. Sheng, look this way.

44
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,780
Mr. Sheng, can you tell us what you're planning to do next?

45
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,550
Miss Cheng Liao from Pinecone Video, is there anything you'd like to ask me?

46
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,540
Just now, you used one stone to decide the game.

47
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,730
I'd like to ask, Mr. Sheng Jingchu,

48
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,510
when did you think to use

49
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,940
this crucial move?

50
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,240
After a little fox

51
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,320
sent me some medicine, I thought of it.

52
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,310
You're actually flirting openly with one of Pinecone Video's female interviewers. Answer the question seriously.

53
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,690
Long before I used one stone to relieve two stones from peril,

54
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,980
I had already calculated everything.

55
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,490
Now that you've won this game, what do you want to eat tonight to celebrate?

56
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,900
You decide.

57
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,520

All Uncles and Aunties, you can eat well and drink well today,

60
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,210
eat anything and drink anything. Uncle Cheng's treat!

61
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,920
- Good, good!
- Except for hot dishes, eat whatever you want!

62
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,460
Eat the candy, you'll be happier.

63
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,050
Panda Bear, I feel especially guilty now.

64
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,870
I used this pillow before,

65
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,010
I thought it was really comfortable.

66
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,630
But I didn't think that you'd be allergic to it.

67
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,790
It caused you to almost lose the game.

68
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,870
I don't blame you.

69
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,230
It's because my body is too weak.

70
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,430
How about I go to the gym and get some exercise in?

71
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,770
No need.

72
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,910
I think you are fine just like this.

73
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,770
My dad just sent me a WeChat.

74
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,970
He said you should come to our house to eat tonight.

75
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,660
He's making his best dish, braise Lion's Head.
 (T/N: Braised Pork Meatballs in Brown Sauce)

76
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,370
I'm never picky about food.

77
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,430
What are you picky about then?

78
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,900
I'm only picky about people.

79
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,850
But you don't get to pick anymore.

80
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,650
Then... let me get a good look.

81
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,790
It's all your fault. Making trouble.

82
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,180
Sorry. I know it's not your fault.

83
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,350
Perhaps between the two of you,

84
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,970
you and Panda Bear just jinx each other.

85
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,940
So I can only ask you to suffer and stay here for now.

86
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,860
Hopefully, a kindhearted person will take you in.

87
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,310
- Let's go.
- Wait.

88
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,440
This is my first time formally eating with Uncle Cheng.

89
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,160
This clothing is too casual.

90
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
It's not too casual.

91
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,660
The people in Tian Shui Alley are modest. You know that.

92
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,780
If you're dressed up too formally,

93
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,640
other people would think that I was getting married.

94
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,070
I don't want people to misunderstand.

95
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,940
What are you thinking?

96
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,720
I'm not thinking anything. I'm going to change into a suit.

Uncle, who are you trying to scare in broad daylight?

101
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,130
Who told you to put the flour up there?

102
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,520
Isn't it because I didn't see any room on the counter.

103
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,090
Flour cannot be put up there. It's a rule in the kitchen!

104
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,350
Oh, oh. I'll pay closer attention next time.

I'll help you clean up.

Don't blow! I'm waiting to marinate the meat.

109
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,540
Marinate the meat? Are you making something delicious for me?

110
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,310
Yes, yes, I'm making something delicious for you. Hurry and go!

111
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,060
Uncle Cheng, the way you look now,

112
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,010
is the most handsome than I've ever seen you.

113
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,910
- Handsome? Really handsome?
- Yes.

114
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,810
Come! Come!

115
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,070
Stinky rascal. Would I cook something delicious for you?

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,360
In your dreams! I'm cooking for Sheng Jingchu.

117

There's no cutting point here. You've lost this round.

118
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
A true gentleman doesn't talk when he watches a game.

119

This is the same here, too.

If you go this way, you'll only get squeezed.

121
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,180
Are you good at playing GO?

122
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,240
Of course. I can even let you have quite a few stones first.

123
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,260
This move of yours isn't good.

You can jump, or capture a stone.

Friend, can you play GO, too?

126

We're all in the same class and taking lessons at the GO club straight ahead.

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,230
Want to play a game?

128
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,550
I haven't played against real people for a long time.

The teacher won't allow it.

Don't panic. It's fine, it's fine.

Don't be anxious. Listen to me. The operation went smoothly.

154

It's nothing too serious.

155
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,620
He just needs to recuperate for a while and then he'll be okay.

- Thank you, Doctor.

161
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,090
It's fine.

162
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,930
Doctor, I'll take care of the process.

163
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,940
This way.

164
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,840
- Dad.
- Dad.

[Emergency]

166
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,720
What are you doing here?

167
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,010
You can leave. There's nothing for you to do here.

168
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,750
Sister...

169
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,480
I'm sorry.

170
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,650
I know that you don't want to see me right now.

171
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,770
I don't even want to see myself either.

172
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,390
If I weren't greedy over having fun,

173
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,580
I would've bought the stuff earlier and nothing would've happened to Uncle Cheng.

174
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,550
This is all my fault.

175
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,410
I'm sorry.

176
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,760
I'm solemnly apologizing to you.

177
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,700
Once Uncle Cheng wakes up, I'll apologize to him too.

178
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,080
I don't dare ask for your forgiveness,

179
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,720
but can you let me stay to help you do something?

180
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,120
I'll say it again. Get out.

181
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,170
I'll wait outside the door then. If you need anything, you can—

182
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,910
Get out!

183
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,390
Uncle Cheng, the way you look now is the most handsome than I've ever seen you.

184
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,820
Handsome? Really handsome?

185
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,250
- Yes.
- Come! Come!

186
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,630
Dad.

187
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,290
Dad, are you awake?

188
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,210
How do you feel?

189
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,260
What is this place?

190
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,170
This is the hospital.

191
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,880
Who are you?

192
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,350
Dad, don't scare me.

193
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,760
Don't you recognize the two of us?

194
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,500
I was joking with you.

195
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,210
My daughters are still so pretty.

196
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,080
You scared us! Oh, I didn't do it deliberately.

197
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,750
Are you okay?

198
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,890
Slowly. Slowly.

199
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,140
Why don't I feel much pain?

200
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,870
They gave you some pain killer shots. So the sense of pain isn't that acute.

201
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,390
Here, drink some water.

202
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,370
Dad, if you feel unwell anywhere, hurry and tell me.

203
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,970
We'll get the doctor to come.

204
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,320
I feel okay. I don't feel bad anywhere.

205
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,080
I was really scared at that time.

206
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
I was afraid that kid would get hit.

207
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,960
Why didn't you think about yourself?

208
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,630
Aren't you concerned that we'd be afraid of you getting hit?

209
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,630
I'm an adult. Oh, right! How's that kid?

210
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,660
The child is fine. His parents picked him up.

211
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,900
Before they left, they said to me that they'll come another day to thank you specifically.

212
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,270
No need, no need.

213
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,260
Right now, I'm just

214
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,460
feeling...

215
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,480
How are you feeling?

216
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,350
Hungry.

217
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,440
All right, it looks like you really are okay.

218
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,280
Just wait then. I'll buy some porridge for you.

219
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,910
- Drink some water.
- I'll drink some water.

220
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,430
All right.

221
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,810
These two are from the Traffic Management Bureau.

222
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,400
- Office Luo and Officer Ji.
- Okay.

223
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,990
You all talk then.

224
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,290
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem, no problem.

225
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,870
- Hello.
- Hello.
- We came to see Mr. Cheng understand more about the situation.

226
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,560
Okay. It so happens that he just woke up. Come this way.

227
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,830
Dad.

228
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,360
Are you Mr. Cheng Fengshou?

229
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,220
Yes.

230
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,510
Has the driver that committed the mishap surrendered?

231
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,770
Not yet. So we hope that you can provide us with some clues.

232
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,220
But don't worry, we're taking this case very seriously.

233
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,620
Mr. Cheng.

234
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,840
When the incident happened, did you see the license plate of the car?

235
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,140
Or the appearance of the driver?

236
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,290
No, I didn't see it.

237
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,680
- This...
- There's nothing that we can do.

238
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,260
He didn't see the driver.

239
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,220
Please wait a moment.

240
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,170
May I ask, are you having difficulty in finding the driver that committed the mishap?

241
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,360
Here's the situation. We got the security monitoring video.

242
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,270
The vehicle involved in the accident has a license plate that's been smudged by mud.

243
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,080
And the driver was wearing a hat and mask, so his appearance cannot be seen clearly.

244
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,870
So there's definitely some difficulty.

245
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,760
Can I take a look at the security monitoring video?

246
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,110
Perhaps I can help.

247
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,640
Please play it again.

248
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,080
Play it again.

249
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,130
Play it again.

250
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,470
Even though the license plate was covered with mud,

251
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,930
thankfully, there are a few areas where the mud is thin.

252
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,980
From certain angles, under light, we can make out some of the shapes.

253
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,330
We made out one number and one letter.

254
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,210
In "All-Around Challenge" did you use the same method as with the fingerprints?

255
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,100
Essentially the same.

256
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,530
But according to Officer Luo,

257
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,030
even so, the investigation will still be difficult.

258
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,520
It may be hard to track down the driver who caused the accident.

259
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,050
There's definitely more than one clue. I'll continue looking.

260
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,420
After I take you home, I'll sub in for Xu Chi at the hospital.

261
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,110
You work too hard.

262
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,540
Uncle Cheng has limited mobility.

263
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,930
Both you and Cheng Yi are girls. You're not strong enough to help him move around.

264
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,590
Xu Chi and I already agreed. We'll take turns every other day.

265
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,900
But you're about to compete! This is going to impact your state of mind too much.

266
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,090
With Uncle Cheng injured, seeing you upset...

267
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,160
makes my heartache.

268
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,440
But you've already won five rounds.

269
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,250
If you win just one more round, you'll win the match. I really don't want this to affect your competition.

270
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:37,220
Liao Liao, your matters and your family's matters

271
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,570
will always be more important than winning a match.

272
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,940
It's so nice having you with me.

273
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,350
Senior Brother.

274
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,650
- Jingchu.
- How come you're here?

275
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:20,060
I had originally invited Cheng Liao to play a murder mystery game at my friend's place. She told me everything.

276
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,790
This is for Uncle Cheng.

277
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:26,200
Senior Brother, patients with bone fractures aren't allowed to drink tea.

278
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,960
This is melon peel and egg drop soup.

279
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,200
Patients with bone fractures can't take tonics in the first one or two weeks. They must eat only light and bland foods.

280
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,750
This soup can help with encouraging absorption of the extravasated blood.

281
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,980
This is for you.

282
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,750
Staying up all night is bad for your health.

283
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,530
There's a chrysanthemum, osmanthus flowers, goji berries, cassia seeds, and burdock in here.

284
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,500
- Drink it when you're thirsty. It should at least make it a little easier for you.
- Okay.

285
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,170
I asked Junior Brother to come, but he didn't pick up my call.

286
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm guessing he's not in a very good mood, so I didn't tell him much.

287
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,370
Tell him to concentrate on preparing for the match and not get distracted.

288
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,740
Senior, how about this, why don't you go home?

289
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,690
I'll watch over him for you. You can be at ease knowing I'm here.

290
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,090
Not you.

291
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,560
Why not? I'm still decent at taking care of people.

292
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,320
Uncle Cheng can't move right now.

293
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,070
You have to help him go use the bathroom.

294
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,100
It's not that I can't do it.

295
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,530
It's just that Uncle Cheng and I don't know each other very well. I'm worried it'll make him feel uncomfortable.

296
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,280
Go home. I'll be okay.

297
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,760
Jingchu, we know that no matter how much we try to urge you, it's useless.

298
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,290
How about this? If you need anything at all, call us the first chance you get. Okay?

299
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,480
Senior, when you're sleeping here at night, make sure to cover yourself well. Don't catch a cold.

300
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,940
Also, tell Uncle Cheng that we wish him a speedy recovery.

301
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,610
Okay, I'll tell Uncle Cheng when he wakes up.

302
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,210
What are you doing?

303
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,320
That's my lucky charm.

304
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,420
Think of it as me wishing Uncle Cheng well.

305
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,430
Look! Uncle Cheng doesn't want it!

306
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,460
You put a plaque with the character "south" on it in his bed. It's going to be harder for him to recover now.

307
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,640
- I didn't mean it like that. I -
- Shoo, shoo, shoo.

308
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,910
- Let's go.
- Uncle Cheng has some pretty strong legs.

[Inpatient]

310

"Please withdraw the charges. I'm willing to settle with a high price."

311
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,920
How did we get this?

312
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,650
When was it delivered?

313
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,830
It should have been in the middle of the night.

314
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,230
I didn't leave the room after Senior Brother and they left.

315
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,600
I think this person must be panicking.

316
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,350
How about we just let it go?

317
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,740
They knew they made a mistake, give them a chance.

318
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,630
Dad, what are you talking about?

319
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,940
This is a hit-and-run; they have to be severely punished.

320
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,430
Didn't they mention a settlement? They must have some difficulties.

321
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,400
Dad, can't you put your sympathy somewhere else for now?

322
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,030
Uncle Cheng, you can't accept the settlement.

323
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,790
That's right, Uncle Cheng.

324
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,380
Mr. Sheng, thank you for providing us an important clue.
[Binhai City Police Station]

325
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,610
We'll start the investigation right away.

326
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,680
Mr. Sheng, we heard you are helping the police with a hit-and-run investigation, is that correct?

327
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm trying to help.

328
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,910
When we interviewed Mr. Cheng Fengshou earlier this afternoon,

329
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,610
the offending driver wants to settle the case with a vast sum of money.

330
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,940
We won't accept the settlement.

331
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,640
- Why are you so resolute about this?
- It's related to the law.

332
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,020
There's no room for negotiation.

333
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,850
Do you want to say something to the offending driver?

334
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,380
I think you should turn yourself in as soon as possible.

335
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,560
Mr. Sheng, you seem to be exhausted.

336
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,430
Will your condition affect the performance at the match the day after tomorrow?

337
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,720
I am a bit tired,

338
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,260
but there are some things that are more important than victory or defeat.

339
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,790
Have you considered postponing the match at all?

340
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,150
Junior Brother Yao Ke.

341
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,490
Senior Brother Jing.

342
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,040
Come in.

343
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,330
That's not necessary.

344
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,920
I can see you need this cup of coffee more than I do.

345
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,380
Then let me prepare a cup of tea for you.

346
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,990
I'll leave shortly.

347
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,420
I missed Xiao Lan's call a few days ago.

348
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,540
It must've been tough on you these past few days.

349
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,280
The hospital sofa really isn't that comfortable.

350
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,860
Jingchu,

351
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,150
are you sure you don't want to postpone the match?

352
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,720
No need.

353
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,170
Actually, it was hard to imagine,

354
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,410
that you'd say,

355
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,710
"Some things are more important than victory and defeat."

356
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,090
That's what I really sincerely think.

357
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,580
I'm here today just to see how you were doing.

358
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,260
Get some rest. I'm leaving now.

359
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,660
No need to see me out.

360
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,220
Jingchu.

361
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,030
Are you sure you don't want to postpone the game?

362
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,710
I'm sure.

363
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,270
[Uncle Cheng's Restaurant]

364
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,970
My life was pretty carefree before.

365
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,270
I've never really had it tough.

366
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,380
When I encountered any problems, I never had to solve them on my own.

367
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,680
Since I arrived at the restaurant, this is a life I've never experienced before.

368
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,790
It's also been the most happiest and refreshing time of my life.

369
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,520
But now it's also the time where I'm feeling the most helpless.

370
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,370
I don't know how to face Uncle Cheng...

371
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,280
and you.

372
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
I'm not angry.

373
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,840
Really?

374
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,000
Jiang Yuda,

375
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
do you know why I agreed to let you stay here back then?

376
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,600
Actually, I never disliked you right from the start. It's true.

377
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,000
I even thought you were quite similar to me.

378
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,200
You had goals and ideas. You're a man of action.

379
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,600
So I kept hoping to help you

380
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,200
as much as possible.

381
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,200
But it's not possible now.

382
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,040
Zhiliao and I were both brought up by Cheng Fengshou by himself.

383
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,160
All these years,

384
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,800
he's had plenty of ups and downs with us.

385
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,300
He had to be both our mother and our father.

386
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,000
That's why our love for him is also doubled.

387
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
I don't know that after telling you all this,

388
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,600
if you can understand how important he is to me.

389
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,600
When I got that phone call,

390
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,000
heard that he was hit by a car,

391
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,300
I was so scared that I kept trembling and couldn't even say a word.

392
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,100
Do you know how much I'm afraid of losing him?

393
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,800
In that instant, all the worst

394
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,600
and most terrible thoughts jumped out of my head.

395
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,300
When that car was heading toward him, what if the speed was just a little faster?

396
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,700
What if the car had run directly over his body?

397
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,350
I'm sorry.

398
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,200
I'm sorry.

399
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,200
I know you're not directly responsible for this incident.

400
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,470
But if I let you continue to stay by his side,

401
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,770
I won't be able to be at ease.

402
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,600
So you're asking me to leave then?

403
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm done talking.

404
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,000
Sit down.

405
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,200
I made soup for you. You need to drink it while it's hot.

406
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,200
You've been too tired these past few days.

407
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,000
Here.

408
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,230
When someone is cherishing me, I don't feel tired.

409
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,000
Hello, Older Sis.

410
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
The driver in the accident was found?

411
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,100
Okay, let me see. Bye-bye.

412
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,910
Next is a news update, everyone.

413
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,700
Through clues, we conducted a thorough investigation through

414
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,000
Mr. Yang's closest friends and family.

415
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We ultimately determined that the driver in the accident was Mr. Yang's son, Yang Xiaoyu.

416
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,190
Yang Xiaoyu is an 18-year-old high-school graduate

417
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,600
who just finished taking the college entrance exam.

418
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,300
The day before the incident, Yang Xiaoyu took the opportunity of his father being out on a work-related trip

419
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,000
to secretly take out the car for practice. He drove away after hitting someone.

420
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,800
Subsequently, Yang Xiaoyu drove to the outskirts of the city and abandoned the car.

421
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,200
We've learned that Yang Xiaoyu has been charged.

422
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,600
His college entrance qualifications have also been canceled as well.

423
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,400
Get into the car.

424
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,600
What are you doing? What are you doing?

425
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,400
Sheng Jingchu, you ended my son's bright future!

426
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,800
Forget about living well. Just you wait! I'll definitely make you pay!

427
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,600
Calm down!

428
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,200
This guy is too arrogant!

429
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,500
His own son drove a car and hit someone, but he wants to get revenge against you.

430
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
It's good that they caught the driver.

431
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,200
But you've been so tired for so many days already.

432
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
You also had to take care of my dad.

433
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,800
My heart aches when I see you like this.

434
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:49,000
Perhaps you have a way to help me refresh and clear my mind?

435
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Good luck!

436
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Drink the soup.

437
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,200
The sixth game of the 10 game GO match is another close battle.

438
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,200
They've already played from day into the night.

439
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,000
Xiao Lan, don't you think Black has the advantage in this game?

440
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,800
Right now, Black has ten points of territory.

441
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,000
Its probability of winning is very high.

442
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,400
It appears that this battle of dignity in Game 6

443
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,700
is based on the perseverance of Junior Brother Ya Ke's tenaciousness.

444
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,200
But I think Senior Brother Jing may be affected

445
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,950
by the recent incident of the auto accident.

446
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,600
His energy is clearly insufficient.

447
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,500
See? The time that it takes him to calculate

448
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,200
is clearly longer than the previous game when he kept sneezing due to allergies.

449
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,780
But, actually, we can see that

450
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,200
Junior Brother Yao Ki is very cautious in this game.

451
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,800
So it's about the same for both of them in terms of the countdown time.

452
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,400
If Black can play the endgame in a normal manner,

453
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,200
the game is basically determined already.

454
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,200
Both sides have entered the last countdown.

455
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,780
They have to play the moves within a minute.

456
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,800
The time for thinking is very short.

457
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Right now, both sides have space for about 100 points.

458
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Not only do they have to count the points correctly. They also have to calculate the end game well.

459
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,400
Jingchu was so busy but still came to be with me a couple of days ago.

460
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,000
If he loses this game, wouldn't I become a sinner?

461
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,200
If you really feel bad about it,

462
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,400
you should be good and let your leg heal.

463
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,200
Once you've completely recovered,

464
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,800
cook a big feast to repay him.

465
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
That's no problem.

466
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Why does Yao Ke play his moves without looking at the board and instead keeps staring at Jingchu?

467
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,000
Also, neither of them are showing any facial expressions. What are they thinking?

468
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,400
You can't tell? It's obvious. Look at how calm Yao Ke looks.

469
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,300
Actually, he's full of thoughts.

470
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,100
All these years, he's never been able to defeat Sheng Jingchu.

471
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,200
He's finally seeing hope in this game.

472
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,600
I think he's still not sure whether he can really win or not.

473
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,600
See? See that? He just glanced again.

474
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,800
I bet he's feeling all messed up and getting distracted.

475
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,100
Our little Jingchu must be thinking,

476
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,200
"I may lose this game,

477
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,800
but I can't let Yao Ke see through my weakness."

478
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,000
You're saying "our" so quickly.

479
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,400
Here, eat some apples.

480
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Xiao Yi.

481
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
I'll eat the peel.

482
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,400
Is Sheng Jingchu going to lose this game?

483
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,000
Before the match, Yao Ke bragged that he could win six games.

484
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,200
That's already burst like bubbles.

485
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,300
Can he really get a crushing defeat?

486
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,200
He'll definitely exert full force in the next five games to get a tie.

487
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,800
It's too early to say if he can get a tie.

488
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
But if he defeats Sheng Jingchu in this game,

489
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,600
it would still be big news. It would be the first time in 10 years.

490
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Junior Brother Yao Ke's corner move may be trying to buy so time.

491
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,600
Looking forward to seeing white's move to counter it.

492
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,600
Next, let's see how Senior Brother Jingchu will counter it.

493
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:45,800
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

494
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,000
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

495
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,800
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

496
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,200
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

497
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,400
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

498
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,200
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

499
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,700
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

500
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,800
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

501
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,600
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

502
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,600
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

503
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,600
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

504
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,300
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

505
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,400
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

506
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,400
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

507
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,800
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

508
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,800
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

509
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,800
♫ There is color all around you ♫

510
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,600
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

511
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,200
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

512
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,200
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

513
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:50,000
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

514
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,100
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

515
00:45:54,100 --> 00:46:00,300
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

516
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,890
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

517
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:10,000
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

518
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

519
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

520
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,800
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

521
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:41,000
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
