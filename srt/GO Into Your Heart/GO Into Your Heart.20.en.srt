[GO Into Your Heart]

17
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,150
[Episode 20]

18
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,120
So today I'm officially challenging you to a 10-round GO game.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,690
What are you watching so intently?

20
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,000
My sister's first interview at Pinecone Video.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,850
It was such a pity she wasn't able to produce Unrivaled GO Player.

22
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,410
Now that she got to interview Yao Ke, it's sort of made up for it.

23
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,460
Really, that Yao Ke. He loses every time he competes with you

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,030
And yet, every time the media interview him, he is indignant. This time, he's really provoking you more.

25
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,780
The excitement online about the 10-round GO game is even increasing.

26
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,730
You really don't need to respond?

27
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,060
There's no need to respond, it'll quickly pass.

28
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,440
Liao Liao,

29
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,190
I found a very nice island.

30
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,510
They say it's perfect for snorkeling.

31
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,430
Plus, the island is pretty big.

32
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,050
Most importantly, the single overwater bungalow on the island

33
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,020
looks simple and traditional on the outside, but is very comfortable inside.

34
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,790
Plus, it also has a unique overwater hammock.

35
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,950
What's wrong?

36
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,480
Nothing.

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Are you still thinking about the Yao Ke thing?

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,460
Panda, he openly challenged you online

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,740
and promised to give you ten days.

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,080
If you don't respond,

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,710
won't people think you're scared of him?

42
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,850
Rather than wasting time on him,

43
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,960
think about the fact that

44
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,290
when we go to the Maldives,

45
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,380
we'll be staying together.

46
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,020
I need to go cook.

47
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,640
[Break Time]

48
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,100
Hey, Uncle Cheng,

49
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,980
what happened? Are we closed today?

50
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,050
There are family matters I need to attend to today.

51
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,230
Need my help with anything?

52
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,160
No need. We have house guests.

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,300
Just step out for a while. I'll call when I'm done and you can come back. Okay?

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,480
Oh, who's this mysterious guest?

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,920
Is it any of your business?

56
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,510
So that's why!

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,680
You know each other?

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,780
Yes..

59
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,610
We've met a few times before.

60
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,290
- Uncle Cheng, let me stay and help you out.
- Hey.

61
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,970
Rascal!

62
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,780
Stop working.

63
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,480
How about this? Here's 100 Yuan.

64
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,720
Go find an internet cafe and play some games.

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,930
- Don't come back until I tell you to.
- But Uncle Cheng...

66
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,540
- Here, take your jacket.
- Uncle Cheng, I already went...

67
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm not going!

68
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,170
Huh, didn't hear me did you? Do I have to yell at you?

69
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,240
- I'm counting to 3. 1... 2...
- 3...
- 4...

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,290
Hurry up, leave!

71
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,890
If I don't tell you it's okay, you can't come back!

72
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,210
Xu Chi, Uncle has to thank you for this.

73
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,700
Xiao Yi is so popular now, I think all that credit goes to you.

74
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,630
No, no. The value is in the abilities she already has.

75
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,560
It didn't take her long to find an entry point that's unique and captures the audience.

76
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,130
If we're going to give credit, then it's all hers.

77
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,690
- Xiao Yi.
- Huh?

78
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,560
The show is back. You should be happy.

79
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,170
I'm happy.

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,210
It's just that being able to see the words "Cheng Yi's Conversations" on TV again,

81
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,100
- I'm overwhelmed with emotions.
- Overwhelmed? What for?

82
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,720
The show is back and will continue to be aired.

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,200
My daughter is the best! Come.

84
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,080
Here's to my daughter always being the best anchor on Binhai TV.

85
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,210
Don't care about that.

86
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,680
- Uh... Best anchor on Pinecone Video.
- Don't like that one either.

87
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
How about the number one in our family? Does that work?

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,910
That works.

89
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,750
Come on, cheers!

90
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,050
- Old Xu.
- Huh?

91
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,870
This one is to you.

92
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,000
I just said that the show is successful all because of you.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,450
Actually, I want to thank you. You kept me in Binhai.

94
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,970
Kept me in Tianshui Alley.

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,530
I have my own selfish reasons.

96
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,030
Tell us your reasons. Be honest.

97
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,780
It's because...

98
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,850
I don't want Pinecone Video to lose an amazing anchor.

99
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,450
I'm hoping you'll boost my popularity.

100
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,620
Go on.

101
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,010
That's it? You don't want to say it? Let me say it for you then.

102
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,150
Xiao Yi, it's simple.

103
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,630
- He wants to...
- Cheng Fengshou,

104
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,340
stop.

105
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,210
Old Xu, considering our relationship, I'm not in a position to make any conventional remarks.

106
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,020
Just two words.

107
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,400
You're my best friend.

108
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,330
Forever.

109
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,750
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

110
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,610
Then I'll be going.

111
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,210
Liao Liao,

112
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,660
read the guide again when you get home.

113
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,270
If I missed anything somewhere, help me add it.

114
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,880
This is our first trip together.

115
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,340
I hope it'll be a perfect trip that we can talk about for the rest of our lives.

116
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,850
- All right, then I'm heading home.
- I'll take you.

117
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,690
I already called for a car. You don't have to give me a ride every time.

118
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,490
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

119
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,330
Text me on WeChat when you get home.

120
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,900
Okay, bye-bye.

121
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,750
- Hey, Old Master Jiang.
- Xiao Ke!

122
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,810
- Hey, Master Jiang and Master!
- Is Xiao Ke here?
- He didn't come today.

123
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,380
- Don't touch me!
- What brought you two here?

124
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,930
Aren't you two living in seclusion at Master Jiang's place?

125
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,210
I'm so mad.

126
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,460
That kid! Went on TV to say those mean things.

127
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,670
God knows, I've already told him before

128
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,840
after joining Jiuzhou Hall, he needs to get along

129
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,720
with his seniors and juniors here. And then he goes and does that?!

130
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,330
All right, all right. Don't keep talking about the kid like that.

131
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,530
- What's wrong with a senior and junior of the same hall learning from each other?
- No, wait..

132
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,770
Let me tell you. It's good to be a go-getter.

133
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,390
It's a good thing if you ask me.

134
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,620
I don't think Junior meant to be provocative.

135
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,420
- He was just randomly saying things.
- That's right.

136
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,520
- Hey, you guys...
- Master Jiang, have some watermelon and cool off.

137
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,820
Jingchu probably won't take the challenge. Everything will be okay in a few days.

138
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,120
I don't think that's for sure.

139
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,560
How about I go talk to him and convince him to play?

140
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,600
Why are you fanning the flames as a bystander?

141
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,900
- I'm not!
- Ow! Oh my—!

142
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,950
I'm so sorry. So sorry!

143
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,220
I didn't see you coming in. I didn't do it on purpose.

144
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,440
It's okay. I choose to take the high road when dealing with ordinary people.

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,010
Look at him.

146
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,040
Ordinary? What's wrong with being ordinary?

147
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,210
Have you read the Ordinary World?

148
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,670
I have. Hey, you know, I especially like the character Wang Meiyin.

149
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,910
I like him quite a bit, too.

150
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,140
- Oh, then I don't like him.
- But..

151
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,650
This ordinary fruit is also edible?

152
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,810
Oh, right. Those who don't demand much from themselves

153
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,700
are easily happy and satisfied.

154
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,770
I do envy that.

155
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,400
What act is he putting on today?

156
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,470
Judging from his posturing, probably

157
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,690
an arrogant, attractive guy?

158
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,090
It's the latest trend in attracting young women.

159
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,090
Well? Do you get the feeling?

160
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,740
- I'm not sure what you mean by feeling. But, Master,
- Hmm?

161
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,320
he just said the fruit you eat is ordinary.

162
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,410
That you're an ordinary person.

163
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,680
Woman, you're not allowed to stir up trouble here.

164
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,090
- You got caught in the "act".
- Oh...

165
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,420
- I got caught?
- You got caught.
- Hey, Xihe.

166
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,290
- What's on your hair?
- On my hair?

167
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,480
Come, come, come here. I'll get it for you. Come, come here. Lower, lower.

168
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,350
Hey!

169
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,190
Master!

170
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,910
Hurry, bring that iPad over.

171
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,780
Since Xiao Ke mentioned

172
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,340
a 10-game GO match invite, this is important between Go players.

173
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,530
We have to say something.

174
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,460
- Seriously looking forward to this.
- Okay.

175
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,130
All right!

176
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,300
Senior He, your turn.

177
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,390
- Seriously looking forward to this.
- Hey, Old Master Jiang!
- Huh?
- Your turn!

178
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,100
- Say something.
- Hmm..

179
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,070
Seriously looking forward to this.

180
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,770
What happened to you today? You haven't said much, it's not like you.

181
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,690
To tell you the truth, if I knew you were so happily preparing for your trip,

182
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,390
I wouldn't have asked you to meet me.

183
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,730
What's wrong?

184
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,760
Is it because of Yao Ke's 10-game GO match?

185
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,540
I know you're taking your annual vacation.

186
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,730
Also, this is your first trip with Senior Brother Jing, it really means something.

187
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,910
But have you guys talked about the 10-game GO match?

188
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,410
What did he say?

189
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,740
He asked me not to worry about this.

190
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,870
Also, that the public opinion would pass quickly.

191
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,250
He wants me to focus on the trip,

192
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,760
and check the travel agenda he prepared.

193
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
When I asked him...

194
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,640
he also told me he's going on vacation with you.

195
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,270
But... I know for a top GO player like him,

196
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,730
he's probably unsettled by it.

197
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,540
Actually, I can tell that he cares about this.

198
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,090
On the other hand, he's so focused on planning this trip.

199
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,460
He seems unwilling to talk about it, too.

200
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,480
Is the 10-game GO match really that important for a GO player?

201
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,350
A 10-game GO match, to ordinary people,

202
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,540
is probably just two players playing 10 matches against each other.

203
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,820
But, Sister Cheng Liao, if you really understood the true meaning behind the 10-game GO match,

204
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,240
you'd understand what Senior Brother Jing is going through right now.

205
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,680
If he misses the match,

206
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,170
he'll definitely be very, very, very disappointed.

207
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,640
[Jiuzhou Hall]

208
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,020
Here.

209
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,200
Thank you.

210
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,870
10-game GO matches started in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

211
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,100
It's between two GO players, as if they had real guns and swords,

212
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,260
in a power struggle, fighting a brutal battle, type of competition.

213
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,980
There were quite a few famous battles.

214
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,010
Later, this phase of fighting for supremacy

215
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,220
was finally ended by GO Master Wu Qingyuan.

216
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,280
10-rounds of 10 game GO matches,

217
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,580
10 battles, 10 wins, it swept the Japanese GO world.

218
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,240
That's why Master Wu Qingyuan was named

219
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,980
the Eternal GO Sage.

220
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,760
Since then, there were no more 10-game GO matches.

221
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,110
Up until 2014,

222
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,840
then a game destined to only ever appear once in a lifetime occurred.

223
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,250
Ancient 10-game GO match.

224
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,290
Everybody who participates in the matches are exceptional players.

225
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,860
Playing a 10-game GO match is a dream of all GO players.

226
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,020
It is also a recognition for both Xiao Ke and Jingchu of their abilities.

227
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,910
This kind of hand-to-hand combat between two players,

228
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,580
if they don't have a firsthand experience of it,

229
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,850
there's no way to truly understand the taste of the brutality of it.

230
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,520
In other words,

231
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,030
if you can play with a rival with a similar skillset,

232
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,090
compete in a 10-game GO match,

233
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,400
it's a a lucky thing for

234
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,330
every GO player in their professional career.

235
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,370
Xiao Ke is a player who deserves Jingchu's respect.

236
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,600
When he proposed the challenge,

237
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,980
how could Jingchu not look forward to or accept it?

238
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,620
But Sheng Jingchu has beaten Teacher Yao Ke so many times already,

239
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,940
he should also win this time. Right?

240
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,920
That's hard to say.

241
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,850
A 10-game GO match is a game of endurance.

242
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,240
As the game goes by, the players start to understand each other's strategies.

243
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,950
Game play will also become more complicated.

244
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,680
The outcome is unpredictable.

245
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,750
Meaning, Sheng Jingchu could possibly lose?

246
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,010
Of course. But...

247
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,730
it could also stimulate Jingchu's bold, fighting spirit.

248
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,850
In my opinion, Jingchu is very much...

249
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,890
anticipating this match.

250
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,610
Thank you for Junior Brother Yao Ke's invitation.

251
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,190
I'm looking forward to such a decisive battle.

252
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,040
However, I’ll be unable to accept your invitation due to a scheduling conflict.

253
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,800
I hope we'll see each other on a future battlefield.

254
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
Liao Liao.

255
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,040
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,710
What happened?

257
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,570
Come on in and tell me.

258
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,880
What's wrong?

259
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,590
I've been only paying attention to my own happiness,

260
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,040
I haven't taken your feelings into consideration.

261
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,210
The 10-game GO match is important to you.

262
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,490
I didn't even discuss it properly with you.

263
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,360
How do you know that the 10-game GO match is important?

264
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,610
Did you go see Master?

265
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,090
Tell me.

266
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,500
You really want to attend the match,

267
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,360
don't you?

268
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,530
- I thought about it.
- Why didn't you tell me?

269
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,980
It's because you've already applied for your annual vacation. I don't want you to be disappointed.

270
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,230
As long as I can be with you, every day is a vacation day.

271
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,200
Plus, I can also stay with you to help you prepare for your match.

272
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,680
I could also challenge him after our vacation.

273
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,900
He's already given you 10 days to respond.

274
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,420
If you don't accept it on time, people might think you're afraid.

275
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,940
I won't let people say that about my boyfriend.

276
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,540
Give me your phone, send him the acceptance message.

277
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,730
Liao Liao,

278
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,320
do you know how cute you are right now?

279
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,600
But before you arrived,

280
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,200
I just posted my rejection on Weibo.

281
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,900
I just posted on Weibo.

282
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,060
You can all ignore it.

283
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,760
I...

284
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,910
sent it by accident.

285
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,510
sent it by accident.

286
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,340
Right now.

287
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,840
I formally accept Yao Ke's

288
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,890
10-game GO match challenge. Please support me.

289
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,450
You see? Do you all see it?

290
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,420
Sheng Jingchu's formally accepted the challenge publicly!

291
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,740
Director, you're brilliant.

292
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,030
I admire your vision and insight. You deserve this.

293
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,170
Congratulations on getting this hot topic!

294
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,280
Teacher Cheng, our success is all because of you.

295
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,060
On behalf of President Wang and the executives at Pinecone Video,

296
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,440
we want to show our gratitude.

297
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,770
- No... that's too much.
- Y-Y-You're giving me too much credit.

298
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,080
You're the one who knows what's hot right now.

299
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,840
All the credit is yours.

300
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
Please don't say that. Please don't say that.

301
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,860
I just contributed a little bit.

302
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,490
If you want to talk about credit... Cheng Liao.

303
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,310
Yes!

304
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,750
You're the one who sealed the deal.

305
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,720
Director, you shouldn't say that.

306
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,790
I just simply helped out and took a video.

307
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,370
When fathers and sons go off to battle,

308
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,880
the sisters must unite.

309
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,560
For Pinecone Video to have you two sisters,

310
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,320
is truly our blessing!

311
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,200
I've already communicated with President Wang.

312
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,820
Pinecone Video will sponsor

313
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,650
the entire live broadcast of the 10-game GO match.

314
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,390
Um, you, over there...

315
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,560
- Got it.
- Quickly, go and communicate with our PR team,

316
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,560
work on the promotion plan for the competition.

317
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,680
We'll call it...

318
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,840
Pinnacle Battle of the 10-game GO match.

319
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,650
Do I need to communicate with the media as well? Have them cooperate with the promotion?

320
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,370
Of course! We need to make sure all media will cover this battle!

321
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,860
Director, then what else do you need from me?

322
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,790
My dear...

323
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,890
your job is the most important of all. You need to soothe the GO God's emotions.

324
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,870
Make sure he won't change his mind.

325
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,370
VP Xu, take a look at the plan I put together today.

326
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,360
Take a look.

327
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,370
Sister Yi, how about this time we both host the battle?

328
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,160
I can take this opportunity to learn from you.

329
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,390
Sure. No problem.

330
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,410
Lisa, you still have your own matters to take care of.

331
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,070
What do I have on my plate?

332
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,090
We're not recording the All-Round Challenge anymore.

333
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,110
VP Xu, just give me an opportunity

334
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,100
to learn from Sister Yi.

335
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,980
I'll let Director Liu assign your next project.

336
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,690
No problem.

337
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,600
10-game GO match will be hosted by Cheng Yi alone.

338
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
After all, this is a spin-off from Cheng Yi Conversation.

339
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,110
Meeting adjourned.

340
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,750
Senior Brother, you're experimenting again?

341
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,360
My blood pressure is a little high.

342
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,280
Did you lose your phone?!

343
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,080
Jingchu already scared me so much that I didn't sleep last night.

344
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,800
Now, don't you scare me. Okay?

345
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,140
What's the matter Brother Xiao Jing?

346
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,980
Couldn't it have just been a phone call and that would've been the end of it?

347
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,190
These two... one challenged the other on TV,

348
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,380
the other makes a video to accept the challenge.

349
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,640
Both are fellow apprentices from the same hall and they had to draw their daggers and their bows like this.

350
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,430
The more I think about it, the worse I feel.

351
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,770
I'm exhausted.

352
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:09,150
I can't believe how difficult university classes are. There's still so much homework and so many notes to take.

353
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,500
I wish I could graduate immediately.

354
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,910
Only you mere mortals would exhaust yourselves for a mere degree.

355
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,900
Truly outstanding people wouldn't care about these sorts of things.

356
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,010
In my eyes, these vulgar things of the mortal world are just a pile of...

357
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,070
are all...

358
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,690
it's tacky.

359
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,150
You can't even create a sentence that flows, so stop pretending to be so proud. Okay?

360
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:43,380
Pride is in my being, it doesn't matter what you say to me.

361
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,660
Senior Brother Xiao He,

362
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,570
if you keep on being so proud, I'm going to proudly go back to school to finish taking my notes.

363
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,860
You're going to be so proud that you won't even stay to eat dinner?

364
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,430
When I see your pride like this, I can't even eat.

365
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,050
- I'm leaving.
- Stand right there.

366
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,390
Allow the prideful me to finish your prideful notes.

367
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,150
Enough. The two of you can stop "pride this" or "pride that" in front of me.

368
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,620
Saying 'pride' on one side, being 'proud' on the other side; now I'm feeling arrogant.

369
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,350
I mean 'anxious'. (T/N: Anxious and arrogant sound similar in Chinese.)

370
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,030
Xiao Lan, sit down. I want to talk to you.

371
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,590
How could you ask Xiao Jing to accept that challenge?

372
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,740
Did... Didn't you give an affirmative vote too?

373
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,000
I only voted online. He can't see it.

374
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,710
You... You went to see Cheng Liao

375
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,690
to get him to accept the challenge. Isn't... Isn't that stirring up trouble?

376
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,340
How did I become the one stirring up trouble?

377
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,830
What GO player doesn't want to play a 10-game GO match?

378
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,240
- Dad.
- Hey. What are you two doing here? Weren't you at the tea garden?

379
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,230
Every day at that rotten tea garden with his old rogue is so boring.

380
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,400
You've finished off all my wine and you still dare say that?

381
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,780
It was those two who asked us to come and talk about the match.

382
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,840
Oh.

383
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,640
What competition could move the two of you to come?

384
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,380
Of course, it's the 10-game GO match between Xiao Ke and Jingchu.

385
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,520
Hey, you rascal.

386
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,200
You don't look that happy.

387
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,360
No. They're both fellow apprentices.

388
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,100
See... Seeing them... at each other's throats like this...

389
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,310
He's been blaming me for a while already. He says I'm stirring up trouble.

390
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,190
A ten-game duel... If it was a normal competition then it wouldn't be a big deal.

391
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,290
These vicious currents are too strong, they could cause hurt feelings.

392
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,410
Hurt feelings?

393
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,690
Your father and I have been competing all our lives.

394
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,080
We take turns winning and losing.

395
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,830
Just look. The feelings between us are excellent.

396
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,450
Don't say 'excellent'. Our relationship is just okay.

397
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,380
- Hey.
- Hey, when there comes a time where the two of us

398
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,340
fight to the death in a 10-game GO match, perhaps our relationship will be better then.

399
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,540
You old rascal. Drink your tea.

400
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,720
- No. The two of them are decent kids. Tell me. After it's over...
- Huh?

401
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,120
Do you mean that the two of us aren't decent?

402
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,920
That's right.

403
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,930
I didn't say that.

404
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,640
You rascal, you're asking me to sort you out again.

405
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,920
However, we can understand Jingchu.

406
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,700
He will definitely look forward to this competition.

407
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,060
The one I can't understand is Xiao Ke.

408
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,840
Masters.

409
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,050
Hey, Junior.

410
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,410
What's going on today? It feels like New Years.

411
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,460
Hey, what are you doing?

412
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,120
I came today to apologize to the two of you.

413
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,730
No need for that. We understand you.

414
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,240
Thank you for your understanding, Masters.

415
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,300
All these years,

416
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,260
I've been hoping to cheerfully meet Senior Jingchu in a duel.

417
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,680
I can understand...

418
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,820
your state of mind.

419
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,740
But you've said these words so boldly.

420
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,940
Do you believe you can win?

421
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:06,510
Master, this time... if I perform as I usually do,

422
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,290
I can win at least 6 games.

423
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,290
Coconut trees, the beach,

424
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,800
are you laying out the Maldives here?

425
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,830
You could understand it that way.

426
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,130
But my meaning was deeper.

427
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,290
Red dragon fruit signifies "getting off to a good start."

428
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,670
The green kiwi fruit signifies "green lights for the whole road ahead."

429
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,300
But what about the tray?

430
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,800
The tray is gray. Putting oranges on a gray plate is

431
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,430
heading towards glory. (T/N: Playing on words that sounds the same in Chinese.)

432
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,450
I didn't expect that you were a sorceress.

433
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,580
I just want everything to go smoothly for you.

434
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,560
You've worked so hard, I can't bear to eat it.

435
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,620
No way. You have to eat it. If you don't eat it, it won't be effective then.

436
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,740
Then let's eat it together.

437
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,030
You're not allowed to come over here. Play GO, I have to go clean up.

438
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,200
Is it super boring for you when I'm practicing GO this much lately?

439
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,470
No.

440
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,610
I have Wall-e to keep me company.

441
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,940
What did you call it?

442
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,730
I'll formally make the introductions.

443
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,980
This is my good friend, Wall-e.

444
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,620
Wall-e?

445
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,720
That's a great name.

446
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,280
Go play GO, I'm going to clean the rooms.

447
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,920
Brother, why aren't you practicing GO today?

448
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,210
It seems like you're more anxious about previous matches than this one.

449
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,260
I was anxious before because I didn't see clearly.

450
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,540
This calmness

451
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:38,400
is because I've come to understand Sheng Jingchu very clearly.

452
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,010
He...

453
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,390
is like this string of beads in my hand.

454
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,000
Do you mean that you can easily take him?

455
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:53,110
What I mean is that I can easily take him apart.

456
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,990
Oh, I understand!

457
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,700
Brother, this time... are you really that certain?

458
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,360
That guy, Sheng Jingchu.

459
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,590
Don't think he's as calm and unconcerned as he appears.

460
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,150
He cares a lot about who wins and loses.

461
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,680
On the GO board, every little part is a battle.

462
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,610
He can't bear to be behind.

463
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,120
Wait till I see him in the next competition.

464
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,010
I've carefully designed a special trap for him.

465
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,600
It'll be very difficult for him to climb out of it.

466
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,560
He only wants the win, he can't bear to give it up.

467
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,140
That's his greatest weakness.

468
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,850
I'll do that.

469
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,460
What's wrong?

470
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,750
I know why Yao Ke suddenly challenged me to a match.

471
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,030
He must have total confidence

472
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,180
with this 10 game GO match.

473
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,590
He's made progress?

474
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,400
The last time I played GO with Xi He,

475
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,360
he was observing the whole time.

476
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,550
He must have discovered something.

477
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,950
But... even if he was watching the whole time, what can he have?

478
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,540
So for this competition, is that probability of winning that high?

479
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,370
In a duel between high-level players...

480
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,860
One flaw and that one will be defeated.

481
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,070
Undoubtedly, destined to fail.

482
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,150
This time...

483
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,800
it's going to be very difficult.

484
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,670
More difficult than ever before.

00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,000
Hello, esteemed guests and media friends.

487
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,800
I'm the host, Cheng Yi.

488
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,200
Welcome to the opening ceremony for the Pinnacle Battle of the 10-Game GO Match.

489
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,400
From receiving a lot of attention online at the beginning,

490
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,600
to both GO players accepting the challenge,

491
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,800
then came the intensive preparations by Pinecone Video,

492
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,000
it took only about a dozen days in total.

493
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,600
We're finally at the day of the beginning of the battle!

494
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,000
Next, we'll invite the two highly-anticipated players to come on stage.

495
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Let's welcome Sheng Jingchu, 9 dan, and Yao Ke, 9 dan.

496
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,300
Okay, good luck!

497
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,300
To the GO players, the 10-game GO match is considered

498
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,800
a cruel battleground full of flashing blades and swords.

499
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,600
Before the battle officially begins,

500
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I wonder if the two players have anything to say to each other?

501
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,600
This game of the 10-game GO Match

502
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,600
originated from a program that I attended: Reaching Success.

503
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,400
If success was within reach at that time, then this time,

504
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,200
I hope it's success.

505
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,200
The success in my mind is like how it was with previous masters.

506
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,600
Through this battle, I hope we can reproduce another famous 10-game GO match.

- Say a few words.

Cao Xihe, hurry up. The game is about to start.

513

Hey you, Bro!

514
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,900
Are you... playing hip-hop?

515
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,000
Today Senior Brother Jing is competing, Master Xie is not attending.

516
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,200
We are all here sitting, to see who's better...

517
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,000
Better!

518
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,000
They call that Hip Hop?

519
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,000
How about me?

520

What you did is called shulaibao. (T/N: A form of Chinese spoken word.)

You don't know how to appreciate it, woman.

You'll never understand how deep my love for you is.

It's not that she doesn't get it,

524
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,200
it's because you're quick to change it.

525
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,600
Senior Brother, you learn pretty quickly.

526

It's starting guessing the stone time, it's about to start. Hurry up.

527

Both players, please set the starting guess.

528

Today, it's an honor to have two GO masters, Xie Hanzhou - 9th dan

529
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,200
and Jiang Chunlai - 9th dan, to be our live commentators.

Xiao Ke's condition is pretty good today.

535
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,920
Look. He ate one stone and then moved it.

536
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,800
He nailed the white stone's setup.

537
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,700
Very good. Very good move.

538
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,800
However, Jingchu is a bit passive today.

539
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,870
Look. He doesn't want to lose any stones.

540
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,500
He left "ban si" (T/N: fourth rectangle) in "yu xing". (T/N: deception shape)

541
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,600
If that's the case, then Yao Ke, 9th dan has the advantage.

I see Yao Ke has come prepared today for the battle.

You're only watching and you're totally stressed out.

Tell me. They've only been playing for 15 mins,

548
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,400
and the game is already in a gridlock.

549
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,500
You can understand GO now?

550
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,800
I still don't understand GO, but I know people.

551
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,900
Sheng Jingchu seems to be very nervous right now.
