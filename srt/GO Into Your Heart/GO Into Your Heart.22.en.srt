[GO Into Your Heart]

17
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,410
[Episode 22]

18
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,780
Let me do it, don't burn yourself.

19
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,780
Your hands are for GO, they're too precious. I'd better do it.

20
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,820
It is this chef's first time doing BBQ. Give it a try.

21
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,830
Be careful, it's hot.

22
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,240
Why don't you take this?

23
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,660
How is it?

24
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,410
It's hot.

25
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,120
Wow, so sweet.

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,680
- I like it here.
- We can come back here often in the future.

27
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,180
- I'm going to get a cup of water.
- I'll go get it.

28
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,040
You shouldn't move. Watch these others and make sure they won't get burned.

29
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,820
Xiao Qi probably put the water in the white porcelain jar in the kitchen

30
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,120
next to the brown cabinet.

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,910
Can you find it?

32
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,810
Tell me. Can you see colors?

33
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,170
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

34
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,520
How can you tell it's in a white porcelain container

35
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,860
and a brown cabinet?

36
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,460
White has no grey shades, that's why I know.

37
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,560
As for the cabinet...

38
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,470
this is my childhood home,

39
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,050
of course, I remember.

40
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,710
Do you still remember the color you saw when you were 6?

41
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,110
As expected of the memory of a GO god.

42
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,090
There's no way that I'd forget it.

43
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,560
After my parents passed away,

44
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,030
nothing's been touched.

45
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,180
All the furnishings and the arrangement of the household items,

46
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,640
I remember all of them as clear as day.

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,230
Even if I close my eyes,

48
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,360
I can still see it.

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,530
I miss my mom, too.

50
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,120
I still remember...

51
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,320
so many of the things that she told me.

52
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,980
Look over there.

53
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,850
There are three stars lined up in a row.

54
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,830
The Orion constellation.

55
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,550
Orion's Belt.

56
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,920
In the lower-left corner of those three stars,

57
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,170
there's a really bright star.

58
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,110
Sirius.

59
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,290
My mom told me,

60
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,190
"In the middle of Sirius and Orion,

61
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,000
there's...

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,050
a rose that's blooming in the middle of the night sky."

63
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,230
Because its silhouette and color

64
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,780
look very much like those of a rose,

65
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,510
so...

66
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,500
it's a rosette nebula.

67
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,460
Inside the nebula,

68
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,010
there are countless stars being born.

69
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,240
So romantic.

70
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,860
This rosette nebula...

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,110
when I was young and couldn't sleep,

72
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,700
my mom would, on a night like this,

73
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,190
sit in the yard,

74
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,640
cup my face and point it out for me to see.

75
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,640
Now...

76
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,890
I want to gift it to you.

77
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,180
Because I believe...

78
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,930
that your parents must be like my mom.

79
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,390
They've all become that most beautiful star,

80
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,210
hiding in the midst of the most beautiful starry sky,

81
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,540
quietly protecting us.

82
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,690
The power's back!

83
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,250
I can clean up my own things.

84
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,540
You've also had a tiring day.

85
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,320
Liao Liao, rest early.

86
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,580
It's fine. We're leaving tomorrow anyway.

87
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,380
Liao Liao.

88
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,270
You gifted the best blossoming rose in the night sky to me.

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,970
I also have a gift for you.

90
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,060
What is it?

91
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,380
Actually, I had prepared it a long time ago already.

92
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,600
It's just that the carving of the letters took some time,

93
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,960
so you ended up giving me a gift first.

94
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,770
Carving of letters? What letters?

95
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,650
C. M.

96
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,780
C... M...

97
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,440
Centimeters?

98
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,600
Adorkable?
(T/N: "Adorkable" is "chun meng" in Chinese, hence the CM.)

99
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,890
I'm just adorable. I'm not dorky.

100
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,720
It's "greedy cat."
(T/N: "chan mao")

101
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,800
Greedy cat? Let me see.

102
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,150
What are you talking about? It's clearly "Liao Liao."

103
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,110
I'll help you put it on.

104
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,790
Does it look nice?

105
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,320
I picked it because it looked nice.

106
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,200
I wasn't asking you about the necklace.

107
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,210
I'm pursuing you because you're beautiful.

108
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,770
Hello? Dad?

109
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,620
Sweetheart, have you arrived yet?

110
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,470
The two of you aren't staying in the same room, right?

111
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,150
Dad, why are you so annoying? You keep asking me these questions.

112
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,770
We aren't staying in the same room.

113
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,260
Oh, that's good. Listen to your dad.

114
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,650
Even though you're currently in a relationship with Sheng Jingchu,

115
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,750
and I like him very much and don't object to your relationship,

116
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,200
but as a girl out alone by herself, you must protect yourself.

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,070
- You can't just do whatever he says—
- Who are you calling?

118
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,680
- Nobody.
- Still pretending? I already heard everything.

119
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,690
How many times did I tell you? Stop meddling in their relationship.

120
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,820
Why are you still calling behind my back?

121
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,560
- I wasn't! I was calling an old buddy.
- Which old buddy?

122
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,620
You don't know him! It's just... an old friend.

123
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,360
Which of those old fellows around you do I not know?

124
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,550
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?

125
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,780
Give it to me.

126
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,740
Give it to me!

127
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,950
Hello, Zhiliao?

128
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,600
Hi, Sis.

129
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,760
Don't worry. I've confiscated Cheng Fengshou's cellphone for the night.

130
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,010
No one's going to disturb you.

131
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,570
I just knew that you were always the one who treated me the best.

132
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,180
Of course. When it comes to your love,

133
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,330
I'll help you protect it.

134
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,860
Panda, do you know

135
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,880
just now my dad and my sister...

136
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,100
What about them?

137
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,880
My dad said that when a boy goes out,

138
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,600
he needs to learn to protect himself,

139
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,140
so he doesn't get cornered

140
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,190
by his fan girls out in the wild.

141
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,820
That would be hard to explain.

142
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,350
- Is it really that terrifying?
- Yes.

143
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,920
You're ready to go to bed.

144
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,730
Why haven't you changed yet?

145
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,880
Would you like...

146
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,100
me to help you get changed?

147
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,480
Okay.

148
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,870
You help me change.

149
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,460
Wait... you...

150
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,390
you have hands. You change on your own.

151
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,720
Why turn off the light?

152
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,750
It was... an accident.

153
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,350
I mean...

154
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,370
I was just trying to loosen things up. Now that I'm done, I'm going to bed. Good night.

155
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,690
The Chef God is a new show I'm trying to promote.

156
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,310
With the current trend of eating shows,

157
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,660
people have stopped hiding their desire for delicious food.

158
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,370
A couple of days ago, I asked you all to prepare something.

159
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,300
Today, let's brainstorm and think about what direction we want the program to go.

160
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,690
Let's still use the celebrity effect.

161
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,080
Audiences' desire for celebrities add on their love for food,

162
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,470
this combination is a sure hit!

163
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,120
That's right. I can invite different celebrities

164
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,660
and online personalities to be on the show for every episode.

165
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,450
It only takes a couple of posts on WeChat Moments.

166
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,780
Actually, lately, I've been thinking about the general direction

167
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,960
of our show.

168
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,840
Until a friend of mine reminded me

169
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,730
that talented people are often unseen. I think he's right.

170
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,930
I hope that through this show,

171
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,300
we can discover more extraordinary chefs among the common people.

172
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,030
Because food culture starts with the people.

173
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,160
I believe that if we find talented chefs among the audience and community,

174
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,090
who can make dishes that are truly worth promoting,

175
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:59,070
then it'll make more people fall in love with food, learn how to cook and benefit from it,

176
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,810
then that's truly the real goal of our food show.

177
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,380
Miss Chen, you're amazing.

178
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,200
Your idea is much better.

179
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,770
That's right. We need to go back to food itself.

180
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,780
How about inviting your friend here and we can discuss it?

181
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,980
He's... been a bit busy lately. Forget about it.

182
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,950
If we're selecting candidates from a wider audience, let's make the competition like the world map.

183
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,750
We'll gather all the top chefs around the world

184
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,480
and make a global

185
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,500
gourmet feast.

186
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,020
I don't think that's necessary. First of all, it creates unnecessary costs.

187
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,810
More importantly, it completely goes against

188
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,220
the goal of our show.

189
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,670
Chinese food has a long, fascinating history that goes back tens of thousands of years.

190
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,890
There's already enough material for us to use.

191
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,150
We have many schools of cooking styles and overwhelming flavors.

192
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,260
With such a rich food culture,

193
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,240
there's absolutely no need or reason to find good food from other countries.

194
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,950
Also, that friend of mine also said that

195
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,040
he's been to more than ten countries

196
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,960
and tasted local food from everywhere.

197
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,400
However, he's still deeply in love with Chinese food.

198
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,830
Right now, eating Chinese food and learning the Chinese language seems to be the global trend.

199
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,460
Not to mention,

200
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,820
we're Chinese. We eat Chinese food.

201
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,160
- She's right.
- That's right.

202
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,600
You really need to bring your cultured

203
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,890
a friend over and introduce him to us.

204
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,160
I'm only using his experience as a reference for us.

205
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,750
All right. Let's talk about the host.

206
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,070
Cheng Yi hosted the 10 game GO match. With this cooking competition,

207
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,830
it should be my turn. Right?

208
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,600
You're... not really a good fit for this show.

209
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,870
- How am I not a good fit?
- I'll tell you later.

210
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,910
No, you have to tell me. What?

211
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,440
Is it because Cheng Yi is close to President Xu?

212
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,420
I'm embarrassed to even have to say it. Among the things you just said,

213
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,890
did any of them hit home?

214
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,390
How can I hand such an important show to you?!

215
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,240
Continue, please.

216
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,510
- Miss Cheng, please.
- Thank you.

217
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,140
I'll take you to the location later.

218
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,320
We just leased the place, but we haven't cleaned it up yet.

219
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,500
What's going on?

220
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,430
- Why isn't the door opening?
- Press the call button.

221
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,090
Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?

222
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,730
Hello? Is anyone there? The elevator is broken. Send someone over.

223
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,050
No one's answering. Is anyone there?

224
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,180
No one's answering.

225
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,760
What's wrong?

226
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,330
Are you okay?

227
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,960
- Hello?
- Are you okay, Miss Cheng? What's going on?

228
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,380
Don't be afraid. Are you claustrophobic?

229
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,850
Hurry.

230
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,550
Hurry up. Did you bring your phone?

231
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,240
- I don't have my phone with me.
- Is anyone there?

232
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,930
Don't be afraid. It'll be okay.

233
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,300
- Hurry, get the door open.
- It's okay now, it's okay.

234
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,340
It's opening, it's opening. [Be Wild ]

235
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,940
Come, quickly! Come out here.

236
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,970
Easy.

237
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,770
We've known each other for almost twenty years.

238
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,600
How come I never knew you had this issue?

239
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,040
We haven't been stuck in an elevator before.

240
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,850
That's true.

241
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,450
Since when? Are you getting counseling?

242
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,450
It's from when I was little.

243
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,610
I've never heard you mention it before.

244
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,350
There's nothing really to say.

245
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,400
You don't often encounter an elevator malfunction. Probably once in a lifetime.

246
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,390
It won't affect me.

247
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,150
This is the stage I prepared for you.

248
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,820
Do you like it?

249
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,820
I remember when you were a kid, you would take dance lessons. After school, I wouldn't go home.

250
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,720
I'd wait for you outside the classroom with a bottle of water, waiting for your class to end.

251
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,250
When I was young, I had thought

252
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,480
I'd dance like that for the rest of my life.

253
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,050
Who would have realized that I would have practiced so hard

254
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,610
and hurt my leg that badly.

255
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,410
That's just how you are.

256
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,980
You never leave room for anything when you do something.

257
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,590
Does your leg... still hurt once in a while?

258
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,420
Only when it's raining, but usually it doesn't.

259
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,350
Then it means I can invite you to dance.

260
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,690
It's a good day today.

261
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,810
Okay then.

262
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,180
I'll go buy some water.

263
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,150
Old Xu, are you there?

264
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,690
Old Xu! Is there anyone there? Old Xu!

265
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,630
Old Xu…

266
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,770
Xiao Yi, are you in there?

267
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,980
Old Xu!

268
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,280
Old Xu!

269
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,940
Please get me out of here!

270
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,810
Xiao Yi, don’t be afraid. I’ll think of a way to get you out.

271
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,380
Hurry up! I beg you. Hurry up…

272
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,790
Xiao Yi, wait for me! I'll be right back.

273
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,820
Old Xu... hurry up...

274
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,910
Old Xu… Old Xu…

275
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,440
Help.

276
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,800
Liao Liao, good morning.

277
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,940
What good morning, it’s almost lunchtime. At least you knew to get up.

278
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,700
I haven’t slept so well in the longest time.

279
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,520
Here. Drink some warm water.

280
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,150
I'll go make you some food in a bit.

281
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,760
You played with the Rubik's cube when you were young?

282
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,000
I’ve never successfully solved one before.

283
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,880
Liao Liao.

284
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,100
Can you pick up that vase over there?

285
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,830
What’s wrong?

286
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,650
Why don’t you teach me?

287
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,170
Liao Liao.

288
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,380
Please don’t ever leave, okay?

289
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,940
What’s the matter?

290
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,840
To suddenly say such scary things?

291
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,980
This place is nice.

292
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,830
It’s next to the mountain and water.

293
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,430
They weren’t here initially.

294
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,740
It was Master Xie’s idea to move them here.

295
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:25,930
You haven’t told me what your parents used to do.

296
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,130
They were both teachers.

297
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,230
They taught at the same university.

298
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,040
My mom taught mathematics. My father taught vocal music.

299
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,960
So... your IQ is from your mom,

300
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,190
with an excellent memory and exceptionally clever.

301
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,020
And I got my EQ from my dad.

302
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,600
That’s right.

303
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,070
Actually, he didn’t like to talk much either.

304
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,490
But you got his talent. You're such a great singer.

305
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,060
Actually, they had a wish.

306
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,840
They wanted me to attend the same university after I grew up.

307
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,380
This way the whole family could leave and come home together.

308
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,000
Let’s go and see them.

309
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,880
[Tomb of Mother - Zhong Weizhen, Father - Sheng Yuanzhi]

310
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,670
Dad. Mom. This is my girlfriend, Cheng Liao.

311
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,650
I brought her to meet you.

312
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,160
She's beautiful and cute.

313
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,220
She might be young,

314
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,440
but she knows how to take care of people.

315
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,040
You don’t need to worry about me.

316
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,430
I'm living happily every day.

317
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,960
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

318
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,420
Actually, to tell you the truth, I’m not as good as he says.

319
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,610
But... I'll definitely do my best to take care of him.

320
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,720
I'll feed him like a big panda, make him big and chubby.

321
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,890
Do you have some more private words you want to tell them?

322
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,290
I'll wait for you over there.

323
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,520
You don’t need to step away.

324
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,480
Let me give you some space.

325
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,400
Uncle and Auntie, I'll come to see you again.

326
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:48,870
Dad. Mom. It must have been you who delivered her to me.

327
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,870
The day you left this world, was the day we first met.

328
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,520
She's the most beautiful color in my eyes.

329
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,940
I love her very, very much.

330
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,580
I promise to you both,

331
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:11,230
I will always love and protect her.

332
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,830
You cried just now.

333
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,630
Did not.

334
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,010
You cried.

335
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,530
Did not.

336
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,280
I'll say it in a different way then.

337
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,770
That is... your eyes

338
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,810
let you down and drooled.

339
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,360
A little bit.

340
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,550
I was very happy just now.

341
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,240
I think...

342
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,290
they would be very happy, too.

343
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,900
- Panda Bear.
- Yes?

344
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,690
I think I can hear your heart talking to me.

345
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,780
What's it saying?

346
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,360
It's saying,

347
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,550
you'll love me for a lifetime.

348
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,700
Many people actually don't quite understand

349
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:26,190
why when you were about to become a star, you encountered setbacks and had to retreat.

350
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,220
Even though it's regrettable, but you left

351
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,770
the silhouette of your most beautiful years

352
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,760
on the screen and in the audience's hearts.

353
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,040
After all these years, you have a happy family...

354
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,450
What time is it now?

355
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,130
At dinner time, Zhiliao sent a WeChat saying she was getting in the car.

356
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,640
Is there a traffic jam? I'd better cook dinner for her.

357
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,980
Do you think Sheng Jingchu will starve her?

358
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,700
She has a boyfriend now.

359
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,920
- That's right.
 - If you always stay in a spot for just a little bit,

360
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,790
it's just like the main topic of this series,

361
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,340
Reaching Success.

362
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,010
You'll always feel that you're missing something.

363
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,880
No matter how long it's been,

364
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,950
regardless of whether you're happy or not,

365
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,570
you'd always want to fill that empty spot.

366
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,450
Of course,

367
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,190
perhaps it's because of the family's support—

368
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,310
[Reaching Success]

369
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,710
- Xiao Yi.
- Huh?
- There's something...

370
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,540
that Dad doesn't really dare ask about.

371
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,680
Both of you have grown up.

372
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,880
You don't tell me much anymore.

373
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,470
Little Zhiliao is all right.

374
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,850
She has you, an older sister, to talk and vent to.

375
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:47,310
But you... you have to carry all the trouble by yourself.

376
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,390
What exactly do you want to say, Dad?

377
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,950
I understand your personality too well.

378
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,260
Since childhood, you've been competitive and wanted to be first.

379
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,220
But, Xiao Yi, think carefully.

380
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,100
What is success?

381
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,890
When will something get to the end?

382
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,020
You're a bit strange today.

383
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm not strange.

384
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,990
Let me get to the point.

385
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,420
You're doing pretty well every day.

386
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,590
But... have you felt that

387
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,940
you are missing something by your side?

388
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,750
Missing what?

389
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,120
You...

390
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,850
Even Little Zhiliao is in a relationship.

391
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,710
Aren't you anxious about being by yourself every day?

392
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,750
It's good that you work hard every day.

393
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,960
But think about it. If there was someone else next to you,

394
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,850
you could share with him when you're happy, and

395
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,920
you can vent on him when you're unhappy!

396
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,000
Isn't that a good thing?

397
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,710
And then?

398
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,290
See?

399
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,050
It was such a good match.

400
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,790
Comrade Cheng Fengshou.

401
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,030
Regarding your several questions just now, I can answer them this way.

402
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:09,290
First of all, I've never pursued success,

403
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,230
but actually do well in everything in front of me.

404
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,650
Next, it's not that I don't want to be in love.

405
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,700
Falling in love isn't in conflict with work, so why don't I fall in love?

406
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,560
If a suitable person appears someday,

407
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,490
why would I resist? Right?

408
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:26,290
But that person... is absolutely not going to be Xu Chi.

409
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,840
You always say this.

410
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,750
What if you two are together someday, wouldn't it be a slap across your own face?

411
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,930
Falling in love really cannot depend only on looks.

412
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,540
There must be... communication between the souls.

413
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,460
What's this about souls? Isn't that superstition?

414
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,970
I really can't communicate.

415
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,350
I only want you to find a partner.

416
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,830
I haven't finished communicating.

417
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,080
I can't communicate with you either.

418
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,380
This kid.

419
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,650
I'll go inside first then.

420
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,990
The car I ordered is almost here, too.

421
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,830
Then I'll stay with you to wait for a little.

422
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,450
Then...

423
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,460
I have a condition.

424
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,780
I'm keeping you company, but you have a condition?

425
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,310
You came back so suddenly.

426
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,050
Uncle.

427
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,720
Are you all right?

428
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,140
I'm fine. I'm fine.

429
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,430
My dad is definitely okay. His body is in perfect health.

430
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,760
I'm more worried if our door is okay.

431
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,390
Why don't you two come into the house for a while?

432
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,890
No need.

433
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,070
My car is almost here. I won't bother you.

434
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,090
Okay. Goodbye, goodbye.

435
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,290
Bye-bye.

436
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,550
That's enough. He's already left.

437
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,150
Come here. Let me see if it's okay.

438
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,110
Look. I'm in so much pain I can't even talk.

439
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,920
Let me see. Let me see.

440
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,890
It's good. Nothing broke open.

441
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,710
It's not scratched?

442
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,180
I feel that the two of you

443
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,680
have become much closer after going away this time.

444
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,940
Was someone knocking on the door?

445
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,980
No one was knocking on the door. Our dad bumped into the door.

446
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,200
Are you two trying to kill your own dad?

447
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,660
- Hurry, help support my back.
- Okay, come on, come on.

448
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,910
- I'll support you.
- No, no. It hurts.

449
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,170
- My back is cramping.
- Slowly.

450
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,580
Grab that trash bag for me.

451
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,640
Don't worry about it. I'll dump it later. Slowly.

452
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,280
My back.

453
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:26,360
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

454
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,320
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

455
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,220
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

456

♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

458
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,610
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

459
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:51,120
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

460
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,200
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

461
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,070
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

462
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:06,770
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

463
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,890
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

464
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:25,110
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

465
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:47,820
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

466
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,860
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

467
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,340
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

468
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,160
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

469
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,160
♫ There is color all around you ♫

470
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,050
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

471
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:12,280
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

472
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,570
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

473
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:30,480
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

474
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,580
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

475
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:40,430
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

476
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:46,450
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

477
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:50,480
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

478
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,360
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

479
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,240
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

480
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,130
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

481
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:21,290
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
