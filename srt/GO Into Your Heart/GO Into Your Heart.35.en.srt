[Pinecone Video]

19
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,020
In this China-Korea GO Invitational Competition,

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,490
regardless of winning or losing, Sheng Jingchu

21
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,670
will ignite a new round of heated discussions.

22
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,850
Everyone is familiar with Sheng Jingchu already.

23
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,520
So, I won't introduce him much.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,980
The most important segment for today is this.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,100
I, Jiang Yuda, sincerely invite Miss Cheng Yi for dinner today at 7:00 p.m. sharp.

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,220
There's something very important, so please accept it.

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,880
What kind of trick is this?

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,980
This rascal can't be confessing to me just because of the kiss last time?

29
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,170
Miss Cheng, you are an expert in this area.

30
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,660
I'd like to hear your thoughts and suggestions on this.

31
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,480
Miss Cheng?

32
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,440
Cheng Yi.

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,120
Sorry, what were we talking about?

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,470
Cheng Yi, we were just talking about hoping to get

35
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,750
Sheng Jingchu's interview after the competition.

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,780
But this probably depends on you.

37
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,150
I think we should wait and see how the competition turns out first.

38
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,340
If he still performs abnormally this time,

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,880
I'm not interested in reporting gossip to get ahead.

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,560
But if he performs outstandingly well,

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,710
I think an interview would be meaningful and worthwhile.

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,160
This is about everything for today.

43
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,960
Everyone can go back to their own work.

44
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,240
Okay, VP Xu.

45
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,640
You don't really look well today.

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,090
Have you been working too hard at thinking about the new program?

47
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,770
I'm fine.

48
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,600
Let's do this. You should go back in a while to get some good rest.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,390
I'll give you a ride.

50
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,040
I still have something to do. I'm leaving first.

51
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,350
Looking at this posture, he really wants to confess.

52
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,140
There's nothing to fear. You've seen enough confessions.

53
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,060
Whatever he says, just be poised and refuse him.

54
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,860
Didn't you send a WeChat message to say there's something important?

55
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,450
Why is your face red? Are you sick?

56
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,740
What are you doing? If there isn't anything, I'm leaving.

57
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,290
No!

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,560
I really have something very, very important to tell you.

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,620
Let's sit down and talk.

60
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,670
What serious matter is it? Can you tell me now?

61
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,950
I'm probably going back on my word.

62
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,350
I can't keep staying by your side.

63
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,960
- You like someone else?
- No.

64
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,400
Absolutely not. You mustn't misunderstand.

65
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,450
In my eyes, in my heart, there is only you.

66
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,810
I can't even see anyone else.

67
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,700
However, the national amateur championship is about to start.

68
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,050
The winner can directly advance to professional first dan.

69
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,930
I've been working hard to prepare in order to win.

70
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,220
Therefore, I won't be available on demand.

71
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,340
Professional first dan?

72
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,010
As Sheng Jingchu's first disciple,

73
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,690
I can't continue to wear the title of amateur 7-dan and never go forward.

74
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,320
If I can win this championship,

75
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,820
I can officially join the professional players

76
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,850
and take a great leap forward in my GO career.

77
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,540
After such a long time living here,

78
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,450
I have finally reached the moment to inspect my achievement.

79
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,490
For Master,

80
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,750
and even more, for you,

81
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,540
I must change my amateur level to a real dan level.

82
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,370
This sounds good. It's a good thing.

83
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,810
Chatting with me is really not that important.

84
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,800
Of course, it's important.

85
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,590
Even though I can't come on demand,

86
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,000
but my heart...

87
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,320
will be with you every minute and every second.

88
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,500
You must wait for me.

89
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,630
Wait.

90
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,000
You'd better look at it when you get back.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,760
Eat first.

92
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,650
Cheers.

106
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,040
There are so many comments.

107
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,360
You're pretty, and your cooking skill is good.

108
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,030
The video explanation is clear.

109
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,070
Simple and easy to understand.

110
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,210
I hope all the viewer friends who have met me through the cooking competition

111
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,200
will like it and succeed in cooking it.

112
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,380
Thanks, everyone!

113
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,600
A woman who causes trouble. A silly girl

114
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,980
with a stupid brain, you affected GO God's game.

115
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,050
Please let go of our baby.

116
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,820
Panda loses and you all get angry.

117
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,760
Who have my clams offended?

118
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,780
No. I've got to vent steam even if I'm not steaming the buns.

119
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,520
I need to speak up for my clams.

120
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,760
You all don't like it that Sheng Jingchu and I are dating.

121
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,020
But the food is innocent.

122
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,630
I'm sharing good food out of kindness.

123
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,190
Those viewers who want to learn cooking from the video

124
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,400
shouldn't be disturbed like this.

125
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,340
I hope everyone will speak reasonably.

126
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,140
Please don't vent your own agitated emotions inappropriately.

127
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,830
Right now, it's a pivotal moment for Panda to adjust himself.

128
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,190
These people online were already unstable.

129
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,520
I can't provoke them even more.

130
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,260
If it's getting worse and Panda sees it,

131
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,320
he would worry.

132
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,190
Hey, Panda, what's the matter?

133
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,960
Why aren't you talking?

134
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,450
Liao Liao, tell me honestly.

135
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,420
Are you in a bad mood?

136
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,840
No.

137
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,700
You have no idea how happy I am in seeing you.

138
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,680
I'll take you to eat something good tomorrow.

139
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,650
I haven't seen you all day and I miss you.

140
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,130
We probably can't see each other every day for a while.

141
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,820
Why?

142
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,410
Because I'm busy with my career now.

143
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,560
This happens to be the crucial time for Little Fox 2.0 to go online.

144
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,810
Are you also studying your new game style?

145
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,660
In martial arts stories,

146
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,650
the leading characters have to enter seclusion to improve their skills.

147
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,270
So you want to enter seclusion

148
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,880
and you also want to send me into seclusion?

149
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,910
It's the crucial time right now for the China-Korea GO Invitational competition.

150
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,290
You should practice GO at home.

151
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,080
Once the competition is over, we will relax well together.

152
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,880
Since Little Fox is so thoughtful for me,

153
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,840
okay then. I will do my best.

154
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,090
Bye-bye.

155
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,330
The Xingya Cup GO Championship successfully concluded yesterday.

156
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,800
Sheng Jingchu, 9-dan, who was originally expected to win

157
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,660
is suspected of being affected by his love life,

158
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,960
continued his downturn from the GO League's Nanjing competition.

159
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,520
He was out in the first round.

160
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,580
On the other hand, player Yao Ke who relied on his steady and stronger strength

161
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,060
battled against strong opposition to lead Jiuzhou Hall to victory

Those people who posted and attacked online

193

simply saw some one-sided news and arbitrarily made conclusions.

And then? They start to enjoy the feeling of

You don't have to worry about that.

Sheng Jingchu is already an adult.

If he can't even handle this,

how can he be an outstanding GO player?

Of course, I'll miss him.

But this invitational competition is really important to him.

213
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,980
Therefore, I just need to wait until he succeeds in his cultivation.

Yes, there are many expert players, but I can't help it.

I've missed the ranking match in the summer.

222

That's about right. But I'm still quite confident.

00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,890
Based on past matches, whenever Cao Xihe plays against Jo Yeon Hoon,

418
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,690
he always seems to be off his game inexplicably.

419
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,620
I wonder if this is a mutual restriction between players.

420
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,380
You must be steady in a while, and defeat Jo Yeon Hoon in one blow.

421
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,430
So that they won't always say that he is your natural barrier.

476
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,650
Last time they competed, it was a quick win for Jo Yeon Hoon's white stones.

477
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,550
Today, Cao Xihe once again has the black stones.

478
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,420
He plays the Kobayashi Opening move and white quickly enters the game. 
(TN: It is an opening move often used by Kobayashi Kochi.)

479
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,920
The black piece approaches and squeezes. As expected, these two quick players at the positioning stage

480
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,210
are already fighting against each other and neither side is conceding.

481
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,140
Cao Xihe's condition today looks pretty good.  His moves are firm and penetrating.

482
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,200
Right now, the situation for the white pieces is in danger.

483
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,480
Clearly, Jo Yeon Hoon is feeling the pressure. He has slowed down his tempo and has taken a long moment to think about each move.

484
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,950
[Red dragon]
(TN: Chinese in Mahjong also refer to this as red center.)

485
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,770
(Grr.)

486
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,790
In this match, Cao Xihe at 8 dan wins.

487
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,830
I really can't believe it. Cao Xihe 8 dan, this time showed

488
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,560
everyone the art of a beautiful straight line dragon kill.

489
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,190
He directly and efficiently won this game.

490
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,930
- Cao Xihe.
- Yes.

491
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,100
This time, you're finally not showing a disapproving attitude towards me.

492
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,660
I've looked at you for a long time but just only realized

493
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,050
you actually have nothing good to look at.

494
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,990
Let us congratulate Cao Xihe 8 dan for successfully advancing on. 
[Match Room A - China-Korea GO Invitational Tournament]

495
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,490
At the same time, Master Xie Hanzhou as expected has beaten Lee Yong Jae. 
[Match Room B]

496
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,960
The match between Yao Ke 9 dan and Xie Changan 3 dan is still intensely going on.

497
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,080
At this point, it is hard to say who will come out on top.

498
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,920
Yao Ke looks really confident. Evidently, it seems he has a way to revive his game.

499
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,940
Black piece itself is weak and if it wants to capture white pieces, it'll still be difficult.

500
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,230
Xie Changan is acting unusual in this game. He's playing very aggressively.

501
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,890
He is chasing Yao Ke closely and not letting go.

502
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,060
Good. This black piece is fierce and precisely played.

503
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,890
Obviously, it looks like Yao Ke did not see this move coming.

504
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,230
Xie Changan used a rare kill move to lock in the win.

505
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,480
One careless move and the whole game is lost.

506
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,710
Looks like Yao Ke 9 dan will be eliminated.

507
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,040
- Senior Brother is impressive.
- Senior Brother is really great.

508
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,270
You actually won an official match.

509
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,290
I won.

510
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,710
Senior Brother, you removed the seal today.

511
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,330
Removed the seal?

512
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,900
You could say that.

513
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,780
Chang'an?

514
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,390
Ru Mei.

515
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,250
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

516
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,760
Your GO playing is the same as before. Invincibly sweeping away all obstacles ahead.

517
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,960
Let's leave.

518
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,630
Brother, are you all right?

519
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,400
Xiao Pu,

520
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,780
did you see the game? Did you watch it, right?

521
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,890
Do you know who I lost to?

522
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,850
To the one who loses every round of every game, Xie Changan.

523
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,850
Brother. Brother, what are you doing?

524
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:50,220
At this moment out of the four matches, only the match between Cho Shen Woo 9 dan and Sheng Jingchu 9 dan remains ongoing.

525
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,450
Korean Master Cho Shen Woo's GO style is unexpected and dangerous.

526
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,010
If the opponent gets slightly distracted, they will fall into a trap.

527
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,390
Originally, a highly winnable game becomes a badly lost game.

528
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:02,350
His style is known as the Blade of the Ghost.
