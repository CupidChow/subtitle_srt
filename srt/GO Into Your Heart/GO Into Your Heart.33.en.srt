Why didn't you simply ask Yan Xiao to edit those pictures for you?

Master, after I was able to see colors,

149
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,970
I've been thinking,

150
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,950
previously when I played, I was always trying not to lose even a single inch of territory

151
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,750
and I used offensive strategies.

152
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,710
Actually, when I recall that, it was a narrow mindset.

153
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,500
I was certain that I had nothing

154
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,990
and feared losing even more.

155
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,070
Because I feared losing,

156
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,750
I closed up myself tightly

157
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,240
and entered a neverending cycle.

158
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,790
Do you know? This is exactly

159

the reason why I insisted on you moving out of Jiuzhou Hall.

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,200
Master, I want to change my playing style

161
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,770
and not play like I used to.

162
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,740
Because this is the only way

163
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,870
for me to totally say farewell to the old me.

164
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,350
However, in the upcoming competitions,

165
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,020
I may not keep my win streak.

166
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,740
The rule of "Sacrifice Stones to GO First." Didn't you already know when you were younger?

167
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,850
"Sacrifice Stones to GO First" means to not get entangled in trivial places

168
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,080
and lose the ability to take the initiative.

169
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,110
Yes.

170
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,000
To be a truly great GO player, the willingness to sacrifice

171
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,090
is a trial that you can't escape from.

172
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,830
Give up temporary wins or losses

173
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,170
to reach a higher realm.

174
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,230
Whether in life

175
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,770
or on the GO board,

176
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,000
it's the same principle.

177
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,550
Only by giving up can you gain.

178
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,310
Master, starting today,

179
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,860
I want to play GO in a way that truly belongs to Sheng Jingchu.

180
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:06,700
Jingchu, today, you have

181
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,530
finished the assignment I gave you.

182
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,840
Master,

183
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,490
do you mean that

184
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,580
I can come back?

185
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,590
Jingchu, I'm getting older and older.

186
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,380
In the future, Jiuzhou Hall

187
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,830
will rely on you.

188
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,660
Has he really completely recovered?

189
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,150
Yes. It can be said that Senior Brother Jing has gained fortune from peril this time.

190
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,360
A couple of days ago, he even told me he wanted to take the driver's license exam.

191
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,910
It's my alarm.

192
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,270
Today is the day that the Chess Academy announces the level advancements.

193
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,310
The official news is usually announced at this time.

194
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,880
No wonder you used this song for your alarm.

195
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,540
Jingchu's eyes can see colors now. Xiao Lan is also succeeding in advancing her level.

196
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,910
It's double happiness. I think we should celebrate.

197

My wins are clear enough.

205
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,250

- I'll look again, maybe you just didn't find it?

Okay then. I understand. Okay.

213
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,770
Ding Lan, the academy is saying this...

214
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,330
That game between you and Yang Yunfei,

215
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,360
even though you weren't declared the loser because of Xihe's withdrawal from the competition,

216
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,830
but you and Yang Yunfei's rematch

217
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,170
was the fast GO play.

218
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,230
Considering that the competition was the rarely seen

219
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,350
Super Slow two-day format,

for fairness, the score of the rematch

221
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,640
could not be used for level advancement.

222
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,570
Therefore,

223
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,420
you are still not qualified to advance your level.

224

What is this? I won twice and it still doesn't count?

225

Why not just punish me early on?

00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,360
♫ Believing the whole world is a rainbow ♫

481
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,700
♫ But it’s just black and white  ♫

482
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:07,650
♫ Yet, you allowed me to see the dazzling twinkling  ♫

483
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,110
♫ You're like the gentle breeze in my face ♫

484
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,770
♫ Gently moving about in my blue sky ♫

485
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:21,640
♫ Like the key to my dreams moving back and forth ♫

486
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,630
♫ That romantic universe  ♫

487
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,870
- Are you happy with the ride?
- Yes.

488
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:34,040
I didn't expect you learned to drive so fast.

489
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,310
If it weren't for meeting you,

490
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,740
it probably would have stayed in the garage

491
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,030
until its end of life.

492
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,450
Didn't I appear just in time?

493
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,280
Besides, I've clung to you and won't leave.

494
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,110
I couldn't ask for better.

495
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,880
Sheng Jingchu, the way you drive

496
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,940
looks a little handsome.

497
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,000
Just a little handsome?

498
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,390
Liao Liao.

499
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,350
In a few days, I'm going with everyone to Nanjing

500
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,580
to attend the GO League's team competition.

501
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,860
I'll probably be away from you for a few days.

502
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,850
No problem. Just go with ease.

503
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,180
It so happens that I also have to

504
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,990
establish my Little Fox Private Kitchen's channel.

505
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,000
Yan Xiao has already edited my first program.

506
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,160
Once my video is uploaded, I'll have to keep up with the upload frequency.

507
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,010
I have to do some research now

508
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:51,020
to find special festivals and easy-to-cook dishes.

509
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,240
You can be busy, but don't get too tired.

510
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,760
I'm not tired.

511
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,400
I have you next to me, and the career that I like.

512
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,540
I'm really enjoying how I'm living my days.

513
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,790
Me too.

514
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,560
Brother, have you really decided to participate in the competition again?

515
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,440
I'm a professional GO player.

516
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,430
I can't keep hiding like this.

517
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,790
But you don't necessarily have to go to the team competition with Sheng Jingchu.

518
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:33,050
When one is under a roof, one has to lower one's head.

519
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,720
The League's tournament at Nanjing is about to start.

520
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,020
Since I've entered Jiuzhou Hall,

521
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,810
I cannot escape from team competitions.

522
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,790
The competition is mainly about Sheng Jingchu.

523
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,750
Do you know what the gossips outside are saying about me?

524
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,950
They say I've collapsed after the 10-Game GO match.

525
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,150
They say I can't handle defeats.

526
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,410
This competition's lead player is Sheng Jingchu.

527
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,440
For me to return to the competition,

528
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,050
isn't it time to shut those people up?

529
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,430
Brother, what you say makes sense.

530
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,300
Okay, Brother. It's all packed.

531
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:43,920
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

532
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,890
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

533
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:52,570
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

534
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,090
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

535
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:00,210
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

536
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:04,120
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

537
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,610
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

538
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:12,750
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

539
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:18,640
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

540
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,940
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

541
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,450
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

542
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:44,050
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

543
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:05,300
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

544
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,230
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

545
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,910
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

546
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,760
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

547
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,640
♫ There is color all around you ♫

548
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,610
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

549
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,360
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

550
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,370
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

551
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:47,960
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

552
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,030
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

553
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:57,990
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

554
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:03,990
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

555
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,950
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

556
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:14,020
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

557
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,110
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

558
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,210
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

559
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:38,300
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
