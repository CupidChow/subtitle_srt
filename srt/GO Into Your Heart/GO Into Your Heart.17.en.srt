Zhiliao, you got me new clothes?

I love this style. Look!

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,490
It fits just right. The only problem is that it's a bit short.

22
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,840
- No...no, no. It's not yours. Take it off.

No, I love it!

Why do I have to take it off? I like it. Why should I take it off?

I know you like it, but it will get dirty.

27

But I haven't had shirts fit this well for years.

28

Huh? Not for me? Who is it for then?

No, we haven't thought it through.

If you haven't thought it through, why did you leave your clothes at his place

and wear his back?

What are you talking about, Dad?

Look at you. You got the shirt dirty and now I have to rewash it.

You are talking about Cheng Liao, right?

Of course! She wore Sheng Jingchu's shirt back and

64
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,530
left her own clothes there. What was that supposed to mean?

It was raining yesterday.

66

Her clothes probably got wet.

I'm her father. She can't hide anything from me.

I kept asking her questions this morning.

72
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,880
She couldn't look me in my eyes. She must feel guilty about something.

Shut up and get back to work! You are annoying me.

I remember it used to be a beach here when we were kids.

91
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,690
We came here and made sandcastles here often.

92
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,870
Zhiliao used to mess with us when we were building.

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,300
Every time her castle got hit by the waves, she would sit there and cry.

94
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,600
And then you would go buy her cake.

But I always bought two.

I want to talk to you about the offer.

97

When should I tell my HR?

98
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,450
I decided not to accept the offer.

99

If I leave now,

102
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,040
I would feel like

103

But "Conversing with Cheng Yi" will be a failure.

108
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,380
I created a show called "The One Knight."

109
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,490
But I didn't end up making it.

110

Now, I'm planning a new show called "Reaching Success."

"Reaching Success."

112
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,670
The name is intriguing.

113
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,370
Yes.

114
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,310
Most of the time,

115
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,140
we focus on those who are already successful.

116
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,420
There are others

117
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,220
who are only one step away from success,

118
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,570
yet they pause.

119
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,790
These people might be suffering and don't want to give up,

120
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,840
but they are not negative.

121
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,880
Therefore, I think the stories behind them are worth discovering

122
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,250
and worth telling.

123
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,300
I want to hear about it first.

124
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,550
Also, this is a great idea.

125
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:49,200
That's why I think this pitch could get a green light.

I feel like time is passing too slow.

You have my permission! You have my full permission!

481
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
What permission?

482
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,600
Permission for you two.

483
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,800
Look... You guys grew up together and both of you are outstanding.

484
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,800
I saw Little Xu Chi growing up and I know him well.

485
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
That's why, give me your hand.

486
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,800
I'm very happy about you guys!

487
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,300
Cheng Fengshou!

488
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,300
You don't have a toothache anymore?

489
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,300
Come with me.

490
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,300
Go, go!

491
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,800
It still hurts, my dear! But I'm happy.

492
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
Old Xu,

493
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,000
you can't take jokes seriously.

494
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm not joking. I meant everything I said.

495
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,600
Xiao Yi, why does everyone think that we should be together,

496
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
but not you?

497
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,600
Old Xu...

498
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,100
Okay, let's not talk about it.

499
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,000
I've read your pitch. It's great.

500
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,400
I believe this one can draw a perfect period for "Conversing with Cheng Yi."

501
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,800
You can do it.

502
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,400
I will be waiting for you at Pinecone Video.

503

[Uncle Cheng's Eatery]

505
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,640
Are you working in Uncle Cheng's restaurant?

506
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,400
Do you feel threatened that I'm close to her now?

507
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,300
How do you know you are closer to her than I am?

508
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,100
I'm afraid that it wouldn't work out even if you worked here for the rest of your life.

509
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,800
I've been anxious lately.

510
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,800
I feel like that time passes too slow.

511
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,200
Whenever I think about going to work, eating, and getting off work with you,

512
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
I start hoping time can pass faster.

513
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,300
But I will always respect your decisions.

514
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,800
I support your decision in making "Reaching Success"

515
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,600
and come to me with no regrets.

516
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,600
The two of you grew up together and are both outstanding.

517
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,000
I watched Little Xu Chi growing up and I know him well.

518
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm happy about you guys!

I've read the pitch. It's great.

I believe this episode can draw the perfect period for "Conversing with Cheng Yi."

Cheng Yi.

525
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,400
When you get this email, two years have gone by.

526
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,600
Have you become a better host?

527
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Did you make the show

528
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,300
that has warmth and depth?
