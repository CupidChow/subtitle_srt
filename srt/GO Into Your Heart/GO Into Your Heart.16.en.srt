[Episode 16]

18
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,220
Be careful!

19
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,900
Goddess Sister.

20
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,700
Goddess Sister! Goddess Sister!

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,300
Goddess Sister, Goddess Sister, Goddess Sister.

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Goddess Sister.

23
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,940
Are you crazy? Why were you yelling so loudly?

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,330
What are you doing here and riding my father's scooter, too?

25
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,580
Welcome to Uncle Cheng's Eatery.

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,060
So now you've come to my home?

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,180
Leave the scooter and come with me!

28
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,040
To where?

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,770
Somewhere with no people.

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,960
Goddess Sister,

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,790
you brought me this place with no one around,

32
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,510
- what are you up to?
- Cut the crap!

33
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,940
I brought you food and transferred you the money. What else do you want from me?!

34
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,550
Goddess Sister, I know the photo

35
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,940
had a negative effect on you.

36
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,250
I owe you a serious apology.

37
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,580
Forget about that for now.

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,040
Let me ask you. Why are you working in the eatery?

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,820
Please don't misunderstand me.

41
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,810
I just want to be Sheng Jingchu's student.

42
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,930
But he won't take me.

43
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,760
I was thinking if I could get close to Master's girlfriend...

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,750
Master's girlfriend?

45
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,650
Your sister, Cheng Liao.

46
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,550
If you need her help, you can just ask her.

47
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,060
But I don't know her very well.

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,130
If I just asked her directly, that wouldn't be appropriate. Right?

49
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,970
You weren't this polite when you were borrowing money.

50
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,070
I was thinking...

51
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,390
If I become Uncle Cheng's competent assistant,

52
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,760
Master's girlfriend will like me better.

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,190
Then she'll definitely agree to help me.

54
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,630
Why do you have so many sneaky ideas?

55
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,350
Also, if I work here,

56
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,180
I get to see you more often.

57
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,250
So I won't get lovesick then.

58
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,680
You're overthinking it.

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,040
Tell you what. I usually leave early

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,320
and I get home late. I don't usually go to the eatery.

61
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,570
Since my father's agreed to employ you, I can't say no.

62
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,930
Just work hard.

63
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,360
But I have to warn you!

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,950
If you dare disturb me and my family's lives, we'll fire you at any time.

65
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,270
I swear

66
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,650
that I would never harass you indiscriminately.

67
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,070
I only need to be able to...

68
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,410
watch you from afar, and I'll be happy.

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,100
Also, wanting to find a master is your business.

70
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,040
You can't, because of personal reasons, disturb Cheng Liao and Sheng Jingchu's

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,670
- relationship, understood?
- Understood.

72
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,830
Also.

73
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,410
I'm listening.

74
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,720
I helped you out of sympathy before.

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,400
But if you have other ideas about me, I suggest you forget about them.

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,420
It's impossible for us to be together.

77
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,910
Get out.

78
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,430
Get out!

79
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,410
Goddess Sister,

80
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,390
I want to tell you something else.

81
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,080
If you feel sad again,

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,410
you can call me anytime.

83
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,280
I'll keep you company, drink and chat with you, and let you vent.

84
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,140
As long as you need me, I'll

85
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,760
show up by your side at any time!

86
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,280
Don't forget to call me! Hey!

87
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,730
Did... you really watch all of my games?

88
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,470
That's right.

89
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,150
Ever since you were a kid,

90
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,120
from short to tall,

91
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,950
from chubby to skinny,

92
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,440
I've seen them all.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,810
Are you really disappointed?

94
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,690
No. The internet doesn't have any of your scandals.

95
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,950
Other than...

96
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,140
Other than the scandal from the other day.

97
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,790
However...

98
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,560
Actually, I haven't slept well

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,620
in the past few days.

100
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,420
I've been talking to my sister a lot.

101
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,780
Because I just don't know what to do.

102
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,260
I hope you can give me a little more time

103
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,390
for me to get to know you.

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,710
Because I don't want to make the decision lightly.

105
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Also, could you not be mad at me?

106
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,850
I'm not mad at you.

107
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,790
But you don't look like yourself.

108
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,840
After hearing your thoughts,

109
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,650
I'm myself again.

110
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,950
- Then promise me something.
- Tell me.

111
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,980
I'll promise you anything.

112
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,300
Could you stop drinking that much?

113
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,940
It's bad for your health.

114
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,510
Liao Liao,

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
don't feel too much pressure.

116
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,750
I told you,

117
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,720
I'm waiting for you.

118
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,250
No matter how long it takes.

119
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,810
I have to go.

120
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,520
[Chinese Valentine's Day]

121
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,810
Which one is Miss Li?

122
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,600
- Your flowers.
- Thank you.

123
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,400
Are we going to have a dinner

124
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
on such an important day?

125
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,000
I knew you had plans.

126
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,940
But remember you agreed to go home early because you're going offshore.

127
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,200
I've got to work tomorrow.

128
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,040
Okay. I'll wait for you.

129
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,300
Who was that?

130
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,560
- Boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?

131
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,360
I remember now.

132
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,830
The one who picked you up from work last time, right?

133
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,890
Did Sheng Jingchu ask you out?

134
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,250
If no one asks you out today,

135
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,410
prepare to be jealous.

136
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,870
What's with today?

137
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,080
No way, you...

138
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,430
It's Chinese Valentine's Day.

139
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,560
I think it's nice to use green commuting.

140
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,820
It's easy to be late for work when there's traffic.

141
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,590
Walking or biking are both good.

142
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,960
One can also exercise. I vote for green commuting.

143
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,890
- Okay, thank you.
- Sure.

144
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,320
Thank you.

145
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,230
It seems that there's one more vote for green commuting.

146
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,990
What will the final result actually be?

147
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,430
Let us all wait and see together.

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,570
It shouldn't be your job.

149
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,400
I started out by doing field interviews.

150
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,190
But this isn't what you were like a month ago.

151
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,340
With your experience and ability,

152
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,120
there's no need to take this route that you can't turn back on.

153
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,910
Old Xu, we can talk about this another day.

154
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,920
I still have work to do. I need to get back to work.

155
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,220
It's work I need to talk to you about.

156
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,520
With your prospects at Binhai TV station,

157
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,800
it'll be hard for you to make any progress.

158
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,500
It's time to think about other platforms.

159
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,670
President Xu,

160
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,350
turns out you're here to steal me from the station.

161
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,920
Come to Pinecone Video. With your experience and ability,

162
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,650
plus Pinecone Video's flexible and innovative production process,

163
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,220
I believe we'll definitely be able to make the best shows.

164
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,000
Also, if we work together,

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,840
Thank you.

327
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,060
What's wrong with that umbrella?

328
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,200
That one's broken.

329
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,370
Broken? I'm really good at fixing umbrellas.

330
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,970
As a child, our family's umbrella would often break.

331
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,210
I don't know why, but...

332
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,090
Then, it must be this umbrella that's broken.

333
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,910
Let's go.

334
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:55,530
♫ The little sun is shining on my heart and
chases away the sadness ♫

335
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:02,240
♫ The little sun shines on my voyages every night ♫

336
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,060
♫ The rays of the little sun blocks the wind and rain for me ♫

337
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,390
♫ Let me rest here a bit  ♫

338
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,670
♫ Rest on your shoulders.
I suddenly think that a lifetime isn't very long  ♫

339
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,520
♫ Let me have a taste. The taste in your hands  ♫

340
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,030
♫  It's the sun you've given me  ♫

341
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,170
Surprise!

342
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,460
Oppa, even though you asked me out first today,

343
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,410
but I think I should play the host and take care of you.

344
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,950
I personally learned some Korean dishes.

345
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,820
So you can taste the warmth of home on this special day.

346
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,420
Thank you. Wow.

347
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,260
Xiao Lan, you treat me so well.

348
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,060
Xiao Lan.

349
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,980
Oppa, I actually know how you feel about me.

350
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,200
Your recent hints have made it very obvious already.

351
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,820
I know in my heart. I know you like me.

352
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,420
Actually, I don't dislike you either.

353
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,330
You can say it's more of a very good feeling for you.

354
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,640
However, I must make something clear.

355
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,150
I've set a goal for myself. If I don't get to 7 dan as a professional, I definitely won't start dating.

356
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,340
So I want to say...

357
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,730
Oppa, can you wait?

358
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,350
Can you wait for me?

359
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,460
Ding Lan,

360
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,950
I think you've made a mistake.

361
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,660
Actually, I'm not interested in you.

362
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,030
I was being nice to you so that it could purposely piss off Cao Xihe.

363
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,810
What?! Wait! Say that one more time. You were being nice to me because?

364
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,650
Did you buy this?

365
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,600
What should come, eventually came.

366
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,530
Hello.

367
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,000
Oppa, what's up?

368
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
I'm watching a movie.

369
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,740
- Hey! What do you mean by what you just said?
- Wait, just a second.

370
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,490
Why did you do that to me?

371
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,230
Why were you so nice to me?!

372
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,890
She's one of my GO game friends. Don't get me wrong, baby!

373
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,210
Why did you do that to Senior Brother He?

374
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,840
Ding Lan, I really have to leave. I'm sorry!

375
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,420
- Hey! Hey!
- Hear me out. I'm going to book a flight home right now.

376
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,350
- Hey!
- Darling, don't hang up!

377
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,050
Come back!

378
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,650
Xiao Lan,

379
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,930
what's wrong?

380
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,350
Where's Jo Yeon Hoon?

381
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,750
Out of all the idols I like, I liked him the most.

382
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,270
I didn't think he was this kind of person.

383
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,270
What did he do to you?

384
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,950
He told the public that he was single.

385
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,970
However, actually, he has a girlfriend.

386
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,110
He lied to all the fans. He lied to me, too.

387
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,250
He has a girlfriend?

388
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,850
Jo Yeon Hoon went too far!

389
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,370
Say what kind of poor character is that.

390
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,160
Okay, okay. Let's not cry anymore.

391
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,740
I told you before.

392
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,480
He wasn't a good person. You wouldn't listen to me.

393
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,660
Right. From today on,

394
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,350
I'm going to be his anti-fan.

395
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,920
But I still feel miserable.

396
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,230
Finally, I've been waiting for this day.

397
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,810
I've been waiting for this day!

398
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,020
Stop crying. Weren't you supposed to be comforting me?

399
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,740
This restaurant's charcoal-grilled steak is very popular.

400
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,800
Why make this so formal?

401
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,050
We could just eat stir-fried beef with rice noodles. That would have been just as good.

402
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,690
Of course, to bribe you into switching jobs, I have to be more formal.

[Cafe Bar]

404
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,560
- Hello, sir, are you dining in?
- Yes.

405
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,880
Sir, our restaurant has a dress code.

406
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,670
What's wrong with my clothes?

407
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,800
Our requirement for dining in is formal attire.

408
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,700
Just let me enter.

409
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,010
This I really can't do.

410
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,390
All right.

411
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,350
Has he been bothering you lately?

412
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,470
Can't quite say bothering. He's actually someone with a dream, too.

413
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,120
Just in order to learn GO, he flew all the way back from abroad.

414
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,260
His dream is to become a professional GO player.

415
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,710
His interest in me... is just admiration and a bit of having fun.

416
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,980
If he continues to bother you, you have to tell me.

417
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,310
It's really nothing. Eat.

418
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,960
He's affecting my appetite.

419
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,340
Can you help me for a minute?

420
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,180
I wanted you to help me wash the vegetables.

421
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,700
Okay.

422
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,220
Xihe said when a girl

423
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,550
is intently observing a boy,

424
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,560
then, in 8 or 9 out of 10 cases, she's probably interested in him.

425
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,640
You can't say for sure. Maybe...

426
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,340
- Maybe?
- Maybe there is a piece of rice on his face.

- Why did you trick me?
- I like seeing your reaction.

429
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,990
You have a really long wisdom line.

No wonder you're called a high IQ God.

431

Your marriage line extends all the way here.

432
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,920
It means you value soulful connections.

433

And you also have a long life.

Let me look at yours.

435
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,760
Your wisdom line has many branches.

436
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,820
It means that you're fickle.

437

There's feathering above your heart line.

438
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,050
It means you treat others with enthusiasm

439
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,630
and that you're attentive.

440
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,900
Your lifeline and marriage line are both long.

441
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,970
It means...

You'll live a long life with the person you love.

That's my first payment.

486
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,190
Didn't I tell you that you didn't have to pay it back?

487
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,830
I'm not someone who freeloads off a woman.

488
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,980
- You're at it again.
- No.

489
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,000
I just want to let you know

490
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,700
that I'm still working hard.

491
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,970
It's good to work hard. Good luck then.

492
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,560
Sister, I love you.

493
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,030
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

494
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,290
Why don't you make any noise when you walk?

495
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,790
Do I need to march in my own home?

496
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,960
What's with you? Why aren't you sleeping when it's so late?

497
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,990
I'm doing laundry.

498
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,460
Perfect. I have laundry, too.

499
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,920
Wait. Give it to me and I'll wash it for you.

500
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,600
That's okay.

501
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,090
Where did you and Sheng Jingchu go tonight?

502
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,140
We... went out for dinner.

503
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,080
And then what? You didn't do anything bad, did you?

504
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,270
What are you thinking?!

505
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,740
- Give me your clothes and go to sleep.
- No need. I'm not sleepy. I'll wash it myself.

506
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,080
Wait. I'm washing a lot of stuff.

507
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,110
You'll have to wait a long time.

508
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,530
What are you washing? Wasting all the water... Let me see.

509
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,960
Actually, there's not that much. It's almost done.

510
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,540
It could...

511
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,260
Where did you and Brother Xu Chi go?

512
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,340
I saw your bedroom light was still on.

513
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,400
Are you two... together?

514
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,860
Enough with your nonsense.

515
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,490
Don't worry about the business of grownups.

516
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,320
Make sure it gets clean.

517
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,120
Oh, no. The clothes!

518
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:37,240
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

519
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,160
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

520
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,730
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

521
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,500
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

522
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,570
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

523
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,410
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

524
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:01,940
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

525
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,040
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

526
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,900
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

527
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:17,950
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the
Cocoon and flying far because of your talent ♫

528
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,090
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

529
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:37,000
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

530
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:58,550
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

531
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,710
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

532
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:07,160
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

533
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,960
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

534
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,040
♫ There is color all around you ♫

535
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,840
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

536
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,370
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

537
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,520
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

538
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,090
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

539
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:45,420
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

540
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:51,380
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

541
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:57,340
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the
Cocoon and flying far because of your talent ♫

542
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,310
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

543
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:07,230
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

544
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:13,400
♫ No one is a lonely island, running against the wind with me ♫

545
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,360
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

546
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:32,520
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
