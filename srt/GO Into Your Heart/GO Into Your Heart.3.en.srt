00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,690
Sorry. I'm sorry.

165

[Domestic Arrival]

166
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,040
Come. Senior Brother and Senior Sister-in-Law, please get into the car.

167
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,250
Wait! What did you call me?

168
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,040
I call him Senior Brother, so I naturally call you Senior Sister-in-Law.

169
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,590
I am only here to follow him for filming. Why can't I make this clear?

170
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,680
Mr. Sheng, you must discipline him.

171
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,920
Get in the car.

172
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,560
Get in.

173
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,290
Sit inside.

174
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,760
Senior Sister-in-Law, where you sit is the throne.

175
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,690
What throne?

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,290
Put on the seat belt.

177
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,540
Hello? Brother Xu Chi?

178
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,270
Zhiliao, I've been busy these days and haven't been able to reply to your WeChat.

179
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,440
The dessert shop that you like is presenting some new cakes. Pick one and we can meet for afternoon tea.

180
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,270
I'm already in Suzhou.

181
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,370
How about I send them directly to you in Suzhou?

182
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,870
No need for such trouble. Just wait for me to come back and eat.

183
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,160
Do you need anything from me?

184
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,190
Nothing much. Just do your work well.

185
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,950
When you get back, I'll reward you doubly.

186
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,280
Okay. Bye-bye.

187
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,980
Senior Brother Jing, it looks like you have a romantic rival.

188
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,340
Is your nickname Zhiliao?

189
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,220
My original name is Cheng Zhiliao.

190
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,290
I heard the cicadas were crying really loud on the day I was born.
 (T/N: Zhiliao is another name for cicadas in Chinese.)

191
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,580
You were born in the summer?

192
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,980
July 21.

193
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,570
- Let's go inside that way.
- Senior Brother Jing!

194
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,060
Did you miss me?

195
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,120
Why are you here?

196
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,150
I'm here because I obviously have my own reasons.

197
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,060
Xiao Lan, Senior Brother Jing is tired after the day. Come inside with me.

198
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,370
Senior Brother Jing, did you miss me or not?

199
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,160
When will you grow up a little more?

200
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,000
Senior Brother. Senior Brother, let me take you to register now. Let's go.

201
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,090
Wait. Let me make the introductions.

202
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:57,150
No need, Xiao Lan is so talkative. She can chat on her own.

203
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,780
Wait!

204
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,400
Hello, I am Ding Lan.

205
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,790
Hello, I am Cheng...

206
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,180
You are the little reporter who made my senior brother arrive at the match late

207
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,290
and even got into gossip news?

208
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,330
What kind of trouble do you plan to give my senior brother this time?

209
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,330
It was definitely my fault last time.

210
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,320
This time, I guarantee that I will absolutely not affect his competition.

211
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,920
If you really don't want to affect his competition, you shouldn't even come.

212
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,330
This time, I am not even filming him, I also have to work as his assistant.

213
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,300
Where is Xiao Qi?

214
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,660
I'm going to register now.

215
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,470
Wait!

216
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,200
I haven't finished questioning yet.

217
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,250
Don't think that you can easily fool me.

218
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,340
My Senior Brother Jing is simple and easy to fool. I'm not that easy to be scammed.

219
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,340
Younger Sister, how did I provoke you?

220
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,300
He never accepted anyone's interview before, not to mention anyone following him for filming.

221
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,890
Why did he agree to you? Tell me! Are you playing with his feelings?

222
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,180
Based on my IQ, do you think I can deceive him?

223
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,410
He doesn't know anything about love.

224
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,880
Who isn't?

225
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,900
I know you are doing it for his sake,

226
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,280
but don't waste your energy on me.

227
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,250
Go and check on those paparazzi.

228
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,490
- Look at this!
[Have you tidied up Mr. Sheng's room?]
- I'm just being his maid.

229
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,330
One day you will know...

230
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,250
how tough my life is.

231
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,270
To be honest, I'm not mad at you.

232
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,640
You are not a bad person. You look pretty cute, too!

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,360
So are you!

[7th GO Legends of China Competition]

236
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,910
So awful! Hey,

237
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,950
that's an obvious attempt to discredit me.

238
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,720
Say, this Auntie Liu, she invites me to film with her but ends up secretly filming herself.

239
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,760
Is she reporting news or hyping on scandals?

240
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,490
You were being naive, huh?

241
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,690
Only a kid works a full-time job. An old lady wants everything.

242
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,040
Come on! Let's quickly discuss the filming plan.

243
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,490
How can I make you and Sheng Jingchu look sweeter on film? I must make you famous fast.

244
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,440
When you become an internet celebrity and have over 10 million fans, I can use you to achieve financial independence.

245
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,760
What fame? What sweetness?

246
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,420
I don't like him...

- Who are you fooling?
- Are you a fool? Why would I lie to you?

248
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,000
Who doesn't like an innocent first love like Sheng Jingchu? Are you stupid?

249
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,460
I already have someone I like.

250
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,890
It's okay to have someone you like.

251
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,100
You have someone you like?

252

Who do you like?

253
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,140
I have a big brother. I like him.

254
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,320
He likes me.

255
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,430
Look at her...

256
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,780
This is serious then.

257
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,100
Auntie Liu is determined to hype up the scandal between you and Sheng Jingchu.

258
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,140
And she has plans to turn you into the hot topic of Pinecone Video.

259
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,880
Most importantly, Zhang Lisha is here.

Mr. Sheng, your dinner.

261
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,510
Mr. Sheng, which dish would you like first?

262
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,380
Appetizer.

263
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,860
Put it back on!

264
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,160
Mr. Sheng, your room is too warm.

265
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,850
Please leave.

266
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,250
Mr. Sheng, please don't misunderstand me.

267
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,730
Your room is really warm.

268
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,060
Mr. Sheng, I have prepared two sets of dinner and wine.

269
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,100
I want to know you better.

270
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,030
That's not necessary.

271
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,900
Do you know how many people want to know me better?

272
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,940
Don't you want to know who I am?

273
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,550
- I don't!
- Really?

274
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,810
Mr. Sheng, are you there?

275
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,240
- I... I... am sorry!
- Cheng Liao!

276
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,620
Let's have dinner together. The hotel staff just delivered the food.

277
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,100
Hotel staff?

278
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,250
Isn't she a hotel staff?

279
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,580
Mr. Sheng, I think you made a mistake.

280
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,480
My name is Lisa. I'm the anchor woman at Pinecone Video.

281
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,410
Just now, Cheng Liao and I

282
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,230
tried to prank you. Isn't it, Cheng Liao?

283
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Sort of.

284
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,730
We can start now.

285
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,390
Mr. Sheng, just let me know what you want to eat; be my guest.

286
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,340
In the end, all future interviews

287
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,240
will need your full corporation.

288
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,840
Cheng Liao, see if the food suits your appetite.

289
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,880
There is so much food. Thank you, Sister Lisa.

290
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,880
You are welcome. We are co-workers, right?

291
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,350
If that's the case...

292
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,590
You may leave now.

293
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,290
Then, Mr. Sheng, let's add each other on WeChat.

294
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,530
That's not necessary. You can contact me through Cheng Liao.

295
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,480
You are right.

296
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,050
In this case, take your time and enjoy your dinner.

297
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,080
I'll leave now.

298
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,590
Remember to close the door!

299
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,240
Do you know how expensive her outfit is?

300
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,600
I couldn't believe you thought she was the hotel staff.

301
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,470
You are the first man who didn't get captivated by her beauty.

302
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,380
I need to salute you!

303
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,040
I made an appointment with you, not her.

304
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,450
Oh.

305
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,530
Cheers!

306
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,170
So that person asked

307
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,010
me to cooperate on future interviews. What does that mean?

308
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,080
That means, in the future,

309
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,540
she will come interview you, while I go interview Cao Xihe.

310
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,070
She interviews me,

311
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,320
you interview Xihe?

312
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,430
I already set up a time with Cao Xihe tomorrow.

313
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,780
Hey, two big bubbles. Look!

314
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,370
Look.

315
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,020
I set up an interview with Cao Xihe. Why are you here?

316
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,370
Xihe is busy. The plan has changed.

317
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,010
- What plan？
- The plan to stay away from that Lisa.

318
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,870
But this is the company's arrangement.

319
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,280
I accepted a personal interview with you,

320
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,230
not with Pinecone Video.

321
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,580
I will not give interviews with anyone else.

322
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,010
Thank you. But why me?

323
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,710
Because you...

324
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,730
are honest.

325
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,320
Thank you.

326
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,280
I will only accept giving interviews with you.

327
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,780
Find someone else to go interview Xihe.

328
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,510
My information says both Master Jiang and Master Xie want you as their apprentice.

329
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,420
Master Jiang also said he and Master Xie discovered you together.

330
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,250
But you ended up taking Master Xie as your teacher. Is that true?

331
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,610
Yes.

332
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,270
I met my Master and Master Jiang at the same time.

333
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,470
Back then, my master wanted me to be his apprentice, but he couldn't speak up first.

334
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,700
He let Master Jiang go first.

335
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,680
He used a small trick.

336
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,130
- What trick?
- At the time, there was a conference.

337
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,020
They expected my master to go,

338
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,740
but he pretended to be sick and asked Master Jiang to go in his place.

339
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,930
By the time Master Jiang returned,

340
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,430
I already joined Jiuzhou Hall.

341
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,610
Wasn't Master Jiang angry?

342
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,900
He wasn't really angry.

343
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,920
Master Jiang and my master

344
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,470
fought for decades, but they've also been friends for decades as well.

345
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,330
They are the best of friends.

346
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,000
No one has solved it yet.

347
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,400
Actually, I also discovered that...

348
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,720
Come on, ¥50 per try.

349
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,840
Winner gets ¥100.

350
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,430
I won't go back on my promise.

351
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,310
Say, will we meet an expert today?

352
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:50,270
I don't know.

353
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,720
- Give it a try?
- I have no idea how.

354
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,480
I'll help you.

355
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,480
I saw on the news that these endgames are famous ones in history.

356
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,130
It's not for brainless guesses.

357
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,020
Brainless?

358
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,690
Oh...

359
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,860
You can play together as well.

360
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,380
Whoever wins gets the money.

361
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,840
We'll play together.

362
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,830
This is so embarrassing.

363
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,890
Senior Xiao Jing has started lowering himself to the level of an old man on the streets

364
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,550
just to make her happy.

365
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,880
I'd do that too if it made you happy.

366
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,430
Shameless.

367
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,460
Then I'll make a random move.

368
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,800
Oh my! Playing together,

369
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,870
this little girl obviously doesn't know how to play.

370
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,640
Can they win?

371
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,800
Just let the kids try.

372
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,720
It's not an endgame. It's a question of life and death.
(A fundamental concept in the game of GO.)

373
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,320
A question of life and death? What do you mean?

374
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,660
This is what you mean by a question of life and death?

375
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,520
A life and death question, a training method to improve a player's skills.

376
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,210
For someone learning to play GO,

377
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,900
a life and death question can

378
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,920
train your calculation skills and

379
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,530
increase sensitivity to shape.
(Configuration of stones on the board.)

380
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,810
It is very helpful to attacking.

381
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,930
But you have to be very careful when making a move.

382
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,400
Or else, you will lose...

383
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,240
in a flash.

384
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,410
For example, you must

385
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,610
not make a move there.

386
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,430
It looks dangerous,

387
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,260
but to me, it's just a trick.

388
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,630
How did you know?

389
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,690
It's solved. It's solved.

390
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,320
Hey, you lost. Pay up!

391
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,440
Let's go.

392
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,550
Pay up! Pay up!

393
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,280
We don't want the money.

394
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,800
Why are they leaving?

395
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
Stop there!

396
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,040
Oh gosh, run!

397
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,150
Where are you going?

398
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,780
They're in trouble. Let's go!

399
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,420
Hey, wait up!

400
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,360
Yan Xiao, where did you bring us?

401
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,540
Where are they?

402
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,030
They were just here.

403
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,370
Sister Lisa, look! They're over there!

404
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,040
What are you doing? Follow them!

405
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,530
I think we've lost them.

406
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,250
I say, you need to thank me, you know?

407
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,640
You're still smiling? You almost got beat up.

408
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,550
The headline almost became, "Infamous GO player Sheng Jingchu

409
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,540
played GO with an old man at the park and was beat up.

410
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,250
He is unfortunately injured and unable to take part in the GO Legends of China Competition."

411
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,160
Hey, why are you still smiling?

412
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,800
Actually, the old man didn't want to hurt anyone.

413
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,340
What?

414
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,240
He was just surprised I solve the endgame so fast.

415
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,100
- He accidentally knocked over the GO board.
- Oh...

416
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,520
What about those people?

417
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,050
They were speaking in a Suzhou dialect.

418
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,140
You could understand it?

419
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,160
They were looking for the bathroom.

420
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,740
Here is your drink.

421
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,980
Thank you.

422
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,260
Hi, I want a black sugar crispy rice boba.

426
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,150
Hi, sir, what would you like to drink?

427
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,070
Over here!

428
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:14,260
Thank you! Sweet tea with grass jelly is my favorite!

429
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,790
- Yummy!
- Is it that good?

430
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,280
Yes.

431
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,060
Although, the flavor is

432
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,790
not the best, but

433
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,730
the texture is special.

434
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:34,210
It's like when one drinks herbal tea for the first time and is surprised by the flavor.

435
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,850
But after a while, you fall in love with the bitter, burnt herbal taste.

436
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,380
You are so professional with food and drinks.

437
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,790
When I first graduated from college, I worked in a boba shop.

438
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,510
Actually, I like their cake best.

439
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,820
If you liked it so much, why did you change jobs?

440
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:01,080
My dad convinced me that odd jobs don't make a good career. So I became an editor at Pinecone Video.

443
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,660
I saw him just now.

444
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,040

445
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,770
I just saw...

446

Hurry up and take pictures.

447
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,850
Paparazzi, let's go. Hurry up.

448
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:29,280
- Did you get it?
- No.

449
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,610
- No...
- Go after them!

450
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,720
Slowly, slowly.

451
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,420
Where did they go?

452
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,860
They were running way too fast.

453
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,060
Did they learn how to run on water?

454
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,430
I'm exhausted.

455
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,390
Sister Lisa, you should start working out.

456
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,310
If we didn't have to wait for you, we would've gotten the shot.

457
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,780
Who asked you to wait for me?

458
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,490
You guys should have just taken the shots!

459
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,230
What?

460
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,260
I know her!

It's you, right?

Hello.

- You were taking photos sneakily, weren't you?
- Says who?

465

I've been following you guys all morning.

466

Who said you could sneakily take pictures of my Senior Brother Jing?

467

Who said you tedious media could sneakily take pictures?

468
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,220
Who's sneaking pictures? We are just here to see the sight.

469
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,110
Don't go speaking nonsense.

470
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,850
You won't admit it, will you?

471
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,480
Then how about this? Let's call the police over and have them be the judge.

Here.

473

Take the phone and start taking pictures.

00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,400
and GO players in her generation. Cao Xihe, GO level 8.

487
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,560
Age 25. Taught by his master, Xie Hanzhou. A very good player.

488
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,750
Loves playing Mahjong. Is called

489
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,920
the most unprofessional GO player.

490
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,160
Wait! Say that again? Who's unprofessional? How am I unprofessional?

491
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,300
- That's what it says on the materials.
- Wait. Hold on, hold on.

492
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,290
Let me ask you. Who asked you to take pictures of my Senior Brother Jing?

493
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,960
- Company boss.
- What company?

494
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,600
- Pinecone Video.
- Pinecone Video?

495
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,450
What's your relationship with Cheng Liao?

496
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,880
We're great sisters. Do you guys know Cheng Liao?

497
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,210
You should've mentioned it earlier! We're besties.

498
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,180
What did I say?

499
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,560
Cheng Liao's in with them.

500
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,590
Cheng Liao... just you wait.

501
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,300
I was looking at the materials earlier.

502
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,350
Before you moved to Binghai,

503
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,710
you've always lived by the river in Hangzhou.

504
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,460
When I was little, I'd often hear the sounds of those who lived on boats.

505
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,890
If it was a fishing boat, there'd be a young person standing at the front

506
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,120
with a strong physique and suntanned skin.

507
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,850
You still remember something from that long ago?

508
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,440
Unfortunately, they're all incomplete memories.

509
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,040
I still remember the smell of my family's fish soup.

510
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,340
We'd use shrimp heads to make a broth.

511
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,230
The fish would have just a slightly sour taste.

512
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,680
Is it Songsao Fish Potage?

513
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,120
How did you know?

514
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,680
I've seen this dish before on a menu.

515
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,100
It's almost lunchtime. How about I take you to refresh your memory? Let's go.

516
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,830
What are you looking at?

517
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,900
There's a grain of rice on your face.

518
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,540
I'm just kidding.

519
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,470
There's really a grain of rice on your face.

520
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,630
I'm kidding.

521
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,100
The internet says you're always serious in your speech and mannerisms.

522
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,280
That's all a lie.

523
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,090
I'm sorry. Songsao Fish Potage is sold out.

524
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,840
Why don't you order a different dish?

525
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,520
We will just change it to West Lake Beef Soup then.

526
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,320
- Okay.
- Thank you.

527
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,080
May I ask, are you Sheng Jingchu?

528
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,250
Hello. What's up?

529
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,590
I really like playing GO. Can you write something encouraging for me?

530
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,370
Sure.

531
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,880
Persistence will prevail.

532
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,680
Thank you.

533
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,390
That's all you wrote?

534
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,800
Shouldn't you write things like, "If life is a GO game,

535
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,530
I wouldn't just hold the black and white,

536
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,550
but want to become one with the chessboard

537
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,530
and watch life happen

538
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,050
under the wind and clouds."

539
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:51,050
Or something like, "Tasting all flavors of life in tea

540
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,720
and understand life through GO."

541
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,510
What are you saying?

542
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,060
Wasn't that something you said?

543
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,030
Your book, "Sheng Jingchu's Life and GO."

544
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,800
I didn't say that.

545
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,280
I never published a book.

546
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,010
You didn't say that?

547
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,130
Why did I collect all these quotes of yours?

548
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,070
So, when you should accept an interview, you need to accept it.

549
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,250
When you should clarify something, you need to clarify it.

550
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,240
You've got a point.

551
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,570
Tonight, I'll post on Weibo and clarify.

552
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,490
Clarify what?

553
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,000
Clarify that you're not my rumored girlfriend.

554
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,220
Why do you always have me sit here?

555
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,740
Young Lady,

556
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,120
the seat you're sitting in is the safest seat in the entire car.

557
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,180
Think about it. If there's an emergency and I'm steering,

558
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,790
the front passenger seat

559
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,880
is the most dangerous seat.

560
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,830
So this is the throne Cao Xihe was talking about.

561
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,860
Nowadays, it's very rare to find men

562
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,570
who take care of women so much.

563
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,810
Young Lady, you're so lucky.

564
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,130
Thank you.

565
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,980
You're welcome.

566
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,630
So you just confessed everything?

567
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,780
Of course.

568
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,240
They cornered me and I couldn't escape.

569
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,430
Feel lucky I'm back in one piece.

570
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,020
Ding Lan has been suspecting me and now you are doing this?

571
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,340
The misunderstanding will get even worse!

572
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,640
Don't worry. Didn't Sheng Jingchu say he will clear everything up?

573
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,710
Have you checked Weibo yet?

574
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,300
[Weibo]

575
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,520
The recent gossip regarding my personal life is not true.

576
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,820
The girl in the photo was a news reporter who came to conduct an interview.

577
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,040
She is not my girlfriend. Please do not spread such rumors,

578
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,410
so as to not create troubles for the parties involved.

579
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,170
Thank you everyone for your concerns.

580
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,520
He's a pretty reliable guy. He did as he said he would.

581
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,260
Good people receive a lifetime of happiness.

582
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,740
Say, should I write a reply?

583
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,670
Of course. It's only fair.

584
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,670
That way, it'll show that there's no secret relationship between the two of you.

585
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,480
That's true.

586
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,740
But what should I say?

587
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,150
I am but an average and unremarkable girl.

588
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,570
There's nothing special about me.

589
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,550
How am I deserving of the affections of a GO God?

590
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,120
I finished replying.

591
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,000
Look.

592
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,780
Actually, you're very special.

593
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,840
- He replied.
- That quickly...

594
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:53,130
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

595
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,110
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

596
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,970
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

600
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,770
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

601
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,890
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

602
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:27,610
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

603
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:32,960
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

604
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,990
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

605
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,440
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've give me ♫

606
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:14,400
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

607

♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

610
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,750
♫ There is color all around you ♫

611
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,700
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

612
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,260
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

613
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,560
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

614
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:57,280
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

615
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,370
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

619
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:23,100
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫
