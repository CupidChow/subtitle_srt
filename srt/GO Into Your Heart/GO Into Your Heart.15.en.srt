Every single moment with you,

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,060
I feel that time goes by quickly.

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,210
There's not enough time.

21
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,310
I want to be with you every second, every moment.

22
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,940
I want to get close to you, get to know you better.

23
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm a very boring person. The person you see now is not perfect.

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,480
But thankfully, a lifetime is long.

25

But I know,

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,230
I know clearly,

33
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,250
I like you.

34

I didn't know you wanted to tell me this.

38
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,140
I wasn't prepared at all.

39

I don't know what I should say right now.

What should I do? Would he be angry at me?

45
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,770
But I really don't know him well enough.

46
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,550
If I agreed like that, would he think I was careless?

47

Ugh, my head hurts.

48

Foxy, think of something for me.

49
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,870
Think of what I should do. What should I do?

Morning, Junior Brother.

59

Looks like you're having a good day.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,620
Good thing I shut off my phone early yesterday. I narrowly escaped.

61
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,130
What happened?

62
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,530
Late last night, Senior Jingchu asked me to practice with him.

63
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,610
Based on my past experience, he's probably not in a good mood.

64
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,400
Oh.

65
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,010
Doesn't he always play with an AI opponent?

66
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,300
What nonsense?

67
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,380
As long as he's in a bad mood, he will appear...

68
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,590
- in front of me.
- Why didn't you reply to my message?

Don't be forgetting about work now that you're dating.

- Thanks for the hard work. Keep an eye on it, will you?
- Okay.

102
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,100
Again.

103
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,650

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,890
Again.

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,660
- Again.
- I can't.

106
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,090
I really can't play another round.

107
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,170
If I continue, I'm really going to spew blood.

108
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,070
Junior Brother, you've been watching this whole time. Aren't you going to say a single word?

109
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,500
Don't you want to play a few rounds?

110
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,070
Okay, fine. Keep playing dumb.

111
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,740
Senior Brother, how about you play a few rounds with him?

112
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,510
Okay, fine. You're both are ignoring me. That's great.

113
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,190
Senior Brother, why don't I accompany you on a walk?

114
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,420
Let's go take a walk. Let's go.

115
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,820
Let's go. Let's go for a walk.

116
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,560
After all this time, all that before was a lie.

117
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,660
He only recently confessed to you?

118
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,260
Love is a small thing. Common people

119
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,480
like you makes love so complicated.

120
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,060
If it's really this frustrating, wouldn't being single be good?

121
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,680
But I...

122
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,690
Fell in love with him?

123
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,010
Don't make these heartbreaking expressions. As a senior, I'll teach you a trick.

124
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,830
- Tell me.
- One phrase.

125
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,500
Follow your heart.

126
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,600
The thing about love is that there is no logic to it.

127
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,400
There is no particular reason either. No one can say for sure.

128
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Then why do we start from our hearts?

129
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,800
We do what our heart feels.

130
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,600
If you don't like him, cleanly break up with him.

131
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
If you like him, then be together.

132
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,000
I... I don't know for sure.

133
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,400
I have always thought that there was a lot of difference between us. He's a god.

134
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,000
When he told me that he thought of me as a friend, I thought it was my luck.

135
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,200
When he stared into my eyes while he was confessing,

136
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
my mind went completely blank.

137
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,400
I didn't want to believe that it was real.

138
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
I haven't dated before either.

139
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,400
So I don't know if this is the feeling of liking someone.

140
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,000
But I feel that if I carelessly accepted it,

141
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,700
it wouldn't be responsible for me or Sheng Jingchu.

142
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,000
If you want to understand,

143
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,800
then it's simple. Go see him.

144
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
Just sitting here thinking about yourself, even in a whole lifetime, you still won't comprehend it.

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
You should meet regularly and frequently.

146
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
How frequent?

147
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Three times a day.

148
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,300
Three times a day?

149
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,200
That phrase sounds familiar.

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,800
Wow, that was a good move.

151
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,600
Who is it?

152
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,240
Practicing GO, Ms. Ding?

153
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,400
Oppa,

154
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,800
why did you suddenly appear?

155
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,400
You made my little heart beat so fast.

156
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,000
Sorry, I scared you.

157
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Continue practicing. I won't bother you.

158
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Wait a minute.

159
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,600
Why don't you practice with me?

160
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
I can, but aren't you practicing with the AI?

161
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,400
A famous person said that the "AI game is cold.

162
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,100
Only a game with humans has warmth."

163
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,000
Such a philosophical saying.

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,400
Okay, let's play a round.

165
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,400
Right, Ding Lan. Who said those wise words?

166
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,000
Actually, it's not some famous person.

167
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,100
It's just someone who wants to be famous.

168
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
They said it so nicely.

169
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,200
How greasy! I really don't know how people in Korean dramas eat it so deliciously.

170
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,400
Senior Brother Xiao Jing, you beat me (in games) all day.

171
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,200
How are you not happy yet? And you're showing me an upset face.

172
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
If you continue, I'm leaving.

173
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,200
Cheers.

174
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,900
Shift that over there a bit or the beer is going to get warm.

175
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,000
Does she actually like me?

176
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,600
You mean Little Sister-in-Law?

177
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,100
She's pretty caring about you.

178
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,600
Like...

179
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,800
is different from caring.

180
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,200
She cares about my world,

181
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,000
but still rejected me.

182
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,100
She rejected you?

183
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,200
Oh my gosh.

184
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,800
Even you can be rejected.

185
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,800
Doesn't that mean I don't even stand a chance?

186
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,500
How can you understand a girl's heart?

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,700
From my continuous changes in style and different attempts and experiences,

188
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,400
I don't understand their hearts either.

189
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Cheers.

190
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,800
I understand. You can ask me.

191
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Why is it you again?

192
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
How did you find this place?

193
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
Get down.

194
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't worry. Let me tell you.

195
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,100
Let me... I have a lot of dating experiences.

196
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,800
If you're talking about understanding a girl's heart,

197
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,200
I'll say I'm first...

198
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,400
Boy, it's you again. Quickly come down.

199
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,200
- Don't pull on my legs.
- Quickly come down.

200
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,500
- Shut it. Quickly.
- Don't pull on my legs.

201
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,200
My butt!

202
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
- Let go of me!
- Security Brothers.

203
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Security Brothers!

204
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
Mr. Sheng,

205
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,200
we must send this guy to the police. He's already been here twice.

206
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Master.

207
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,800
No need. I'll take care of him myself.

208
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Are you really okay?

209
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
If any happens, call us anytime.

210
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,200
Okay, thank you.

211
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,400
Thank you, Security Brothers.

212
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Master.

213
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,200
I really don't accept students.

214
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,600
Just accept me.

215
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,000
In order to learn GO,

216
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,400
I'm working three jobs at the same time.

217
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,200
My strength is severely weakened.

218
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,400
Look, my hands are still shaking right now.

219
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,000
That's being tired from climbing the wall.

220
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,400
But my heart for learning from you is sincere.

221
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
I certainly, won't let you down.

222
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,670
You just said before that you have a lot of dating experience.

223
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,600
Of course! I can't beat you at GO,

224
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,300
but I'm more experienced in love than you are.

225
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,000
Yuda, you haven't eaten yet. Right?

226
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,200
I haven't.

227
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Eat.

228
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,400
She De Wine. Seems like you thought about it.
(TN: She De is produced by a Sichuan liquor company but here She De can be described as 'willingly' as in to say Liquor he willingly brought for his master.)

229
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
It's easier to carry smaller bottles.

230
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,000
Small ones are the most enticing. Slightly tipsy is better than being drunken in sorrow.

231
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,800
Master, have a taste.

232
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Just a moment.

233
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,050
Come in.

234
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,950
Sister, are you tired?

235
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,000
If you aren't, I want to chat a bit.

236
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,400
What's wrong? You had an argument with Sheng Jingchu?

237
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,400
We aren't at the point of having an argument yet.

238
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,300
Then, what's wrong?

239
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,550
To you, what does it mean to like someone?

240
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,340
How should I tell you?

241
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,580
First, it starts from taking an interest.

242
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,430
Then, start understanding one another.

243
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,000
If your major values conflict,

244
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
no matter how interested you are, being together will be a disaster.

245
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
So, the understanding step is also important.

246
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,400
Just like you and Brother Xu Chi?

247
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
The problem with me and Old Xu isn't understanding. Rather it's about arousing the heart's interest.

248
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Don't make us an example.

249
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
The key is the starting point isn't the same. They are two different situations.

250
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
I haven't understood yet.

251
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,400
Do you not like or are you uncertain?

252
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,300
I just don't understand.

253
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,400
Yet, I couldn't get myself to say no.

254
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,600
When I saw his disappointed expression,

255
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,200
I almost rushed to him and agreed.

256
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,400
When I came home yesterday night, I couldn't sleep.

257
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,600
I was just as distracted at work today.

258
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,300
Zhiliao, you don't have to feel guilty.

259
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,800
You did the right thing.

260
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,000
You're a girl.

261
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Having a careful and cautious attitude about love

262
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,200
isn't a bad thing.

263
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,600
When you don't know enough about someone

264
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
and you didn't recklessly agree,

265
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,200
that's being responsible towards love, responsible towards yourself.

266
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
As well as being responsible towards Sheng Jingchu.

267
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,000
If he knows you're thinking that way, he'll understand you.

268
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,400
But my heart just doesn't feel right.

269
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,200
When I see him like that, I feel even worse.

270
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,600
What should we do? You're feeling bad?

271
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,800
Feeling bad.

272
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,500
Feeling bad is right then.

273
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Feeling bad means you care about him. Your heart aches for him.

274
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,100
If this is liking then what is it?

275
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,800
Don't hesitate. Be bold. Don't be afraid.

276
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
What you have to do now is

277
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,800
to get close to him and understand him.

278
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,200
What if? What if he is the right one?

279
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,700
Happiness is at a hand's grasp.

280
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,600
This is the worry of happiness. The burden of sweetness.

281
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
That's it. We got nothing more to talk about. You can go now.

282
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,600
- I'm not going. I won't go find him.
- Go find Dad.

283
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,800
Such a child.

284
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,230
Master,

285
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,300
let me tell you, to woo a girl,

286
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,300
the most important point is...

287
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,300
taking the lead.

288
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,500
Even if you live together,

289
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,400
you can't guess what the other is thinking about.

290
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
So they say

291
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,610
love must be said out loud.

292
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,800
It must be expressed.

293
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,590
It's not that Brother Jing didn't make himself clear.

294
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,920
It was because my sister-in-law rejected him.

295
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,450
Keep... Keep pursuing her then.

296
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,320
If you want to be good to her, you need to be brave and do things for her.

297
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,280
If you want to express yourself, you need to be loud.

298
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,040
Loud.

299
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,440
But...

300
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,110
But I've already done everything I should.

301
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,400
Why?

302
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,300
Not only did I express myself,

303
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,780
I also had a makeover and expressed it in different styles and tones.

304
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,920
Why did I do that?

305
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,090
I just wanted her to be happy.

306
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,300
What did I do wrong?

307
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,250
You didn't do anything wrong. Let's drink.

308
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,300
There are no secrets.

309
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,040
The secret you believe in

310
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,610
means nothing to the other person.

311
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,200
If you feel bad, it means you care about him. If that's not love, then what is?

312
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,500
All you need to do is to get close to him and to know him.

313
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,590
What if he is the right one?

314
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,800
Happiness is right around the corner.

315
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,220
GO is a lonely practice.

316
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,710
When a player sits in from of the chessboard, all the stress

317
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,020
has to be beard by himself.

318
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,670
♫ The world suddenly became calm ♫

319
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,360
♫ You walked past me ♫

320
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,510
♫ Disappearing quietly, your back only a silhouette ♫

321
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,080
♫ Disappearing quietly, your back only a silhouette ♫

322
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,390
Maybe you will get help from your mates,

323
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,440
but you always play alone.

324
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,190
So whether it's winning or losing,

325
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,940
there aren't many people who can share happiness and sadness with the player.

326

Okay. Take it easy then.

488
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:20,080
- Uncle Cheng, don't worry.
- It's fine. Everything is difficult when you start.

489
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,120
Watch your safety. You must watch your safety first.

490
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,660
- Do it slowly. Be safe.
- Okay.

491
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,490
This... What's going on?
- That...

492
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,820
Child, I know you are being careful.

493
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,320
I pitied you, so you should pity me too.

494
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,630
This is a small business. You can't break these bowls so casually.

495
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,200

Follow the list to buy. Nothing can be left out. If anything is missing, I can't cook the dishes.

497
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,020
Don't worry, Uncle. I'll definitely buy all of them.

498
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,890
Helmet.

499
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,720

500
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,470
They will give you the lowest prices.

501
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,400
Awesome, Uncle.

502
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,620
It's all under my control. Go on.

503
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,460
- Be safe.
- Okay.

504
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,900
Sister Goddess!

505
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,600
♫ The wind blows,
The moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

506
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,590
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

507
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:05,480
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

508
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,940
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

509
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,920
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

510
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,850
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

511
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,300
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

512
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,390
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

513
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:29,320
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

514
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:37,460
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

515
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,320
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

516
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:56,350
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

517
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:17,980
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

518
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,740
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

519
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:26,520
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

520
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,390
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

521
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,440
♫ There is color all around you ♫

522
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,150
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

523
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,930
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

524
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,950
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

525
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:00,810
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

526
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,830
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

527
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:08,740
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

528
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:16,420
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
And flying far because of your talent ♫

529
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,680
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

530
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:26,860
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

531
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:32,620
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

532
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,570
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

533
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:49,220
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
