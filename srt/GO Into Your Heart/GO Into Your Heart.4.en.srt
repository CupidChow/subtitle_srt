00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,680
I've thought of a few ideas to clarify things.

160
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,300
I'd like to discuss them with you.

Why not just let this thing go for a while.

No.

To us young GO players, I believe that

we feel a special sentiment at this very moment.

In the field of the game of GO, the two masters

are evenly matched opponents.

But when Cao Xihe returned from the bathroom,

there seems to be hesitation in his moves now.

Sheng Jingchu's game structure is very sharp.

When he was surrounded around by the white stones, he managed to find a crack.

278

Cao Xihe seems to have missed Sheng Jingchu's smart move.

Will these two moves be this game's turning point?

Cao Xihe stopped the clock and declared defeat. Sheng Jingchu wins!

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,440
Hurry up! Pour me some.

316
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,520
Go easy on the drinks.

317
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,340
You need to enjoy this 8-year-old liquor in small sips.

318
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,510
"Drinking is most pleasant when not being urged. Playing chess without struggling is the true form of winning."

319
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:19,090
Go with the flow. There will be losses and wins. That's how you'll always be happy. Pour it.

320
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm not encouraging you to drink more.

321
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,420
But it's even worse to urge me to drink less.

322
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,620
Pour me some!

323
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,250
Here you go!

324
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,190
Sheng Jingchu beat Cao Xihe in the semi-finals. You beat Uncle Jiang.

325
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,950
You will be facing Jingchu in the finals.

326
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,550
Well, they are all my disciples, I treat them all the same.

327
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,160
The same?

328
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,220
You brat, why are you looking at me like that?

329
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,140
Jingchu won Tianyuan at 16.
 (T/N: A famous GO competition in China.)

330
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,170
Next year, I beat him once in a competition.

331
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,750
Since he left Jiuzhou Hall at 18,

332
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,280
I have not formally played against him in a competition.

333
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,460
It's really hard to predict with his current ability.

334
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,690
I'm really looking forward to playing a few games with him.

335
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,700
Do you think you can beat him?

336
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,070
It's hard to say.

337
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,440
If he beats me, that would be wonderful!

338
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,770
If you lose, it wouldn't be pretty.

339
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,020
Hey. Is that really what you think of your dad?

340
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,380
GO was the minority in the eye of Confucius,

341
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,170
but now it is one of the four traditional forms of art.

342
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,580
What did it rely on to get there?

343
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,730
Isn't it all based on the masters passing it onto their disciples?

344
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,620
Do you know what the masters really want to see?

345
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,580
To see their students surpass them.

346
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,820
If all the disciples can't beat their masters,

347
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,330
then what GO skills are there to pass on?

348
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,860
It's not that, Dad.

349
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,980
You've won so many competitions, but the one you never won was the Legends of China Competition.

350
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,830
You finally beat Uncle Jiang in the semi-finals,

351
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,510
if you lose to Jingchu this time, you'll have to wait 3 more years for another chance to win.

352
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,250
What if...

353
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,520
I'm only saying what if you can't take the championship at the Legends of China Competition.

354
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,530
This wouldn't be something you'd regret in your life?

355
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,530
If I lose to Jingchu, I won't have any regrets.

356
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,540
[7th GO Legends of China Competition - Welcome]

357
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,450
Coming.

358
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,400
Hello, Mr. Sheng Jingchu asked us to bring this over to you.

359
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,220
Thank you.

360
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,480
This guy, he's already that sick

361
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,810
and he still thinks of me.

362
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,460
Fever, headache, soreness in arms and legs...

363
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,370
Coming.

364
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,250
Why are you here?

365
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,310
I am here to give you—

366
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,550
How's your leg? Is it better?

367
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,930
I'm good. I'm good. Get up, get up.

368
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,820
You have a fever!

369
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,050
Hurry, go get some rest. Hurry up!

370
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm going to bring you some warm water.

371
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,300
- Be careful of your leg.
- It's fine.

372
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,250
- Thanks.
- You don't need to thank me.

373
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,850
This is all part of what I should be doing.

374
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,580
At the end of the day, I'm your assistant.

375
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,580
Also, you have a fever because you were waiting for me.

376
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,490
If this is going to affect your upcoming competition,

377
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,550
I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

378
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,760
Cheng Liao.

379
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,100
Let me teach you how to play GO.

380
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,820
You have a fever, you should rest.

381
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,750
Don't you think it's too quiet this way?

382
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,140
The sequence to playing GO is

383
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,710
"Black First, White After"

384
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,950
I know, this spot here,

385
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,540
it's called "Xing Wei."

386
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,670
That's correct, it's called "Xing Wei."
 (T/N: The four corner points on the GO board.)

387
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,840
And how about this one?

388
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,100
This one's called "Tian Yuan."
 (T/N: The center point on the GO board.)

389
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,080
If Black wants to take a corner in the first move,

390
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,850
it needs to be placed in its own upper right corner.

391
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,980
This move is called "Jing Shou."
 (T/N: Literally respectful move.)

392
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,460
It leaves the corner that's closest to the opponent

393
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,280
to them to show respect.

394
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,020
It's also the etiquette in playing GO.

395
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,670
Can Black play its first move

396
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,700
at Tian Yuan?
 (T/N: The center point on the GO board.)

397
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
Of course, it can.

398
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,600
This is how your hand should hold a GO stone.

399
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,700
The middle finger is above, and the index finger is below.

400
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,380
Hold the stone.

401
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,180
The fingers bend a little.

402
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,810
Looking at it from the side, it looks like an eagle's beak.

403
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,170
Try it.

404
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,650
The strength while holding the stone

405
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,260
can't be too light

406
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,930
or too heavy.

407
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,070
If it's too light, the stone may fall off.

408
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,670
If it's too strong, it can be squeezed out.

409
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,170
Watch.

410
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,520
Try it again.

411
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,310
Much better.

412
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,230
Just think. When I learn how to play GO from you,

413
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,900
I have to start by learning how to hold the stone.

414
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,340
This is like a huge engineering project.

415
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,940
You even have a fever now.

416
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,520
You should hurry and rest.

417
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,480
Otherwise, I'll feel guilty again.

418
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,300
The water is done boiling.

419
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,000
Let me get another cup of hot water for you.

420
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,540
You should hurry and take the medicine.

421
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,150
Rest more, drink more water.

422
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,560
You got this!

423
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,720
- Master.
- Jingchu.

424
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,300
I heard that you were sick.

425
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,480
Why didn't you tell me that you had a fever?

426
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,940
Hurry, hurry! Sit down.

427
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,700
Here, here. Lay here.

428
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,600
Why didn't you tell me?

429
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,540
I'm fine, Master. You don't need to worry about me.

430
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,240
I've taken medicine, I'll be fine soon.

431
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,430
Took medicine?

432
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,120
Ever since you entered the hall at six years old,

433
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,560
I've never seen you take any medicine.

434
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,490
I took one pill.

435
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,590
When you used to catch a cold, have a fever,

436
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,510
it was like I was trying to kill you trying to get you to take medicine.

437
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,380
No matter what you wouldn't take it.

438
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,420
Why are you so obedient this time in taking the medicine?

439
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,920
A friend... gave it to me.

440
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,900
Cheng Liao?

441
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,810
How did you know?

442
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,700
I haven't seen this girl yet.

443
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,420
When will you bring her and let me take a look?

444
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,930
I'll check her out for you.

445
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,840
Master, we...

446
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,770
- I'll pour some water for you.
- Don't move. Don't move. Let me feel.

447
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,300
How did your fever get so high?

448
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,370
Stay still, don't move. Wait a moment.

449
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,990
Here, keep this on.

450
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,590
Lie down. Lie down.

451
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,860
Master.

452
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,070
When can I return to Jiuzhou Hall?

453
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,120
At that time, I told you to go out and become independent in life.

454
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,760
It was because I didn't want you to be

455
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,980
trapped in the limited space of the hall

456
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,460
at such a young age.

457
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,850
Remember this. If a GO player doesn't know how to live

458
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,300
and all he thinks about is playing GO,

459
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,270
then he won't be able to elevate to a higher level either.

460
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,760
Take it slowly. Don't rush.

461
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,550
At least, right now

462
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,450
isn't the time yet.

463
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,590
Hurry up and deliver these to the guests.

464
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,580
Okay.

465
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,540
Miss Cheng, I discussed this with the head chef already.

466
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,890
He said he won't cook any dishes that he's not familiar with,

467
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,820
but he'll agree to your other request.

468
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,890
I can use the kitchen?

469
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,860
We're willing to satisfy the competition players' requests as much as possible.

470
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,650
But you must move fast. We can only give you 40 minutes.

471
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,940
Okay. That's no problem. No problem.

472
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,730
Do you need anything? You can tell the head chef.

473
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,510
I think this should be enough.

474
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,130
- Thank you. I've bothered you.
- That's fine. No problem.

478
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,540
♫ Quietly telling me it likes me ♫

479
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,340
♪ Let me secretly guess ♪

480

00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,020
♫ Delivers to the heart a steady stream ♫

491
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,620

Mr. Sheng Jingchu, your exclusive room service has arrived.

495
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,160
Are you feeling better?

496
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,000
Much better. What's the show today?

497
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,760
You made it?

498
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,110
I absolutely did it myself.

499
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,410
I'll get a bowl for you to try.

500
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,000
Try it and see if it tastes like what you remember.

501
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:31,030
Mom! Mom!

502
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,530
Mom!

503
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:54,140
Mom! Mom!

504
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:26,100
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

505
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,130
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

506
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,990
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

507
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,370
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

508
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,530
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

509
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:46,330
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

510
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,830
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

511
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,910
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

512
00:42:54,910 --> 00:43:00,830
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

513
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,800
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

514
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,760
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

515
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:25,080
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've give me ♫

516
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:47,530
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

517
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:51,580
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

518
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,020
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

519
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,850
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

520
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:03,880
♫ There is color all around you ♫

521
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,760
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

522
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,320
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

523
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,400
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

524
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,260
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

525
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,290
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

526
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:40,180
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

527
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:46,100
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

528
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,180
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

529
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,040
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

530
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,070
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

531
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,090
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

532
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:21,020
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
