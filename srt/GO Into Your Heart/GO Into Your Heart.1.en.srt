[Episode 1]

18
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,640
For most people,

19
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,100
owning the colors of the whole world

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,430
is something quite normal,

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,580
until a sudden moment comes.

22
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,540
After extreme pain,

23
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,080
the colors of the whole world fade in front of you.

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,860
From that moment on, life becomes

25
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,740
an endless black and white movie.

26
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,020
When that day comes, what else can you do?

27
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,540
Here's your Iced Americano.

28
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,700
- Thank you.
- No problem.

29
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,160
- Your toast.
- Okay. Thanks.

30
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,440
Group Leader Zhao, your milk tea.

31
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,440
- Thank you, Cheng Liao.
- Your sandwich.

32
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,780
- Thank you.
- No problem.

33
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,700
I thought you were Director Liu. You scared me!

34
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,840
Did you stay here overnight again?

35
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,480
- So...
- So what?

36
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,330
You didn't shower.

37
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,490
I washed my hair. I even...

38
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,860
Do you smell that? I even put on perfume.

39
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,790
No perfume can cover the smell

40
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,530
of a corporate slave.

41
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,920
A corporate slave? You are one, too.

42
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,680
You know your word is not beneficial to either one of us.

43
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,980
So what?

44
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,800
I just like to tease each other.

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,410
You have a dog's nose.

46
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,660
Do you know the feeling to control everything simply by smell?

47
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,250
I only need to smell gently.

48

Director Liu?

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,300
Director Liu is here?

52
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,170
I forgot to tell you. You should hide.

53
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,060
- Why should I hide?
- Don't ask so much, just hide.

54
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,310
Don't ask so much.

55
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,470
Who is that?

56
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,870
The one behind you.

57
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,670
Come with me.

58
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,920
- GO?
- Yes.

59
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,690
A GO competition.

60
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,110
Director, I know nothing about GO.

61
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,260
Do you know how to use a camera?

62
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,880
- Yes.
- I have prepared the questions.

63
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,010
Do you know how to read a script?

64
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,430
Yes.

65
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,560
But what if the interviewee talked about topics beyond the script,

66
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,250
I do not know the follow-up questions.

67
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,380
I'm not being melodramatic.

68
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,490
I'm afraid that if I made any mistakes, I'll ruin the company's name.

69
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,530
Don't make excuses. Go out and learn.

70
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,010
No one dares to reject my assignments.

71
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,620
If it's another task, I won't avoid it.

72
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,190
I really don't understand GO.

73
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,770
Let's not talk about GO. Do you know anything about news reporting, editing, or directing?

74
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,000
Someone like you who studied Landscape Architecture, this is not even your field.

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,300
If it was not for your sister, you wouldn't even get this job.

76
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,080
Up until now, you do not have any presentable results.

77
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,110
Can't you do something to make your sister proud?

78
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,580
In two weeks, your 6-month probation will expire.

79
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,240
If you carry on like this, I'm afraid...

80
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,660
- that to become a full-time employee...
- Director.

81
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,840
It is just GO, I can do it.

82
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,870
You see, that's the attitude young people should have;

83
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,920
dare to try and fight.

84
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,090
This is a great opportunity to show your best quality.

85
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,000
You can carry on talking like that,

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,320
I can report from a rocket.

87
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,000
What did you say?

88
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,360
Nothing.

89
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,800
Take your reporter credentials, and go outside to talk to that...

90
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,040
that...

91
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,720
and confirm everything.

92
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,390
Director, who am I interviewing?

93
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,840
Sheng Jingchu.

94
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,920
Who?

95
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,060
Sheng. Jing. Chu.

96
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,860
Why didn't you tell me this was such a big deal?

97
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,070
Are you still my dear senior and best friend?

98
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,440
Don't blame me now. This is not for anybody.

99
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,060
Why?

100
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,080
Because you are still on probation and you don't belong to any team.

101
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,380
This means you are public resources. You will be assigned to any team that needs assistance.

102
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,760
Also, you are the best scapegoat candidate.

103
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,400
Why am I the scapegoat?

104
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,960
It is because nobody is willing to take on the task of interviewing a GO competitor.

105
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,620
Also, that Sheng Jingchu has never done any exclusive interviews before.

106
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,750
Isn't that mission impossible?

107
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,240
It might be mission impossible for someone else, but not you.

108
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,660
- Do I have superpower?
- You have your sister.

109
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,360
You mentioned my sister again?

110
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,510
Your sister is not a regular sister.

111
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,620
Your sister is the number one anchor woman at our Binhai TV station.

112
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,280
You are talking about who on earth can interview Sheng Jingchu, it is down to your sister, Cheng Yi.

113
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,310
When Director Liu heard your sister was doing the interview,

114
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,030
she immediately reached out to you personally and wanted you to take on the task.

115
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,030
What she means is

116
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,080
to carry the equipment and follow your sister

117
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
to grab the interview from her.

118
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,980
- When an 8 and 9 hasn't appeared yet, it's about to get interesting. Waiting for a new tile to surface.
(T/N: Just some Mahjong plays and terms. When players haven't won for awhile, they shouldn't give up quite yet. )

119
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,850
Capture an opponent's tile.

120
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,160
I'll let you see what it means to have a good tile in hand. The heart flutters but the hand don't shake.

121
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,680
- Self win!
 (T/N: In Mahjong, one can win by picking up a discard from the previous player or by drawing the winning tile by oneself.)

122
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,620
Geez!

123
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,220
Again?

124
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,110
Cao Xihe, you have been winning, do you need to be so excited?

125
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,620
You don't understand. If you win once, you feel great once.

126
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,270
If you keep winning, then, of course, you'll keep feeling great.

127
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,650
As a professional 8th ranking GO player,

128
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,690
why are you coming here all day to challenge our IQ? Is it doing you any good?

129
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,660
You don't understand the fun I am having.

130
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,410
Besides, Mahjong

131
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,290
is part of our traditional Chinese culture.

132
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,080
This legacy has to be passed on by young people like us.

133
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,200
Even if I tell you, you wouldn't understand.

134
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,160
Sportsmanship in playing Mahjong reflects your quality as a person. If you lose, you cannot deny it.

135
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,440
Each of you will take turns to treat me to a meal.

136
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,250
It's fine to treat you to a meal.

137
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,470
But... what about running late to the competition?

138
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,980
- Competition.
- Competition?

139
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,800
You forgot, right?

140
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,430
- Run! Hurry up!
- Go!

141
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,620
Sheng Jingchu, male, 26 years old, studied under a GO Master,

142
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,320
Xie Hanzhou. He is a rare natural talent in GO playing.

143
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,240
He successfully ranked in Tengen at the age of 11. When he was 16, he became known as the Chinese Tianyuan.
(T/N: GO champion, Tengen in Japanese)

144
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,500
From then on, he kept winning in various championships.

145
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,650
He is the hottest young GO player in the country.

146
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,230
Additionally, with his handsome face and long legs, he is definitely

147
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,260
the most popular player in the GO field.

148
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,290
But he is cold, aloof, and doesn't talk much.

149
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,540
He often stays in his own world and is very difficult to deal with.

150
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,660
But if you can get the exclusive interview,

151
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,210
you'll definitely become a formal employee.

152
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,280
I've got to get it. I can't keep living under my older sister's shadow.

153
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,300
Jingchu, I'm so sorry, I said I'd pick you up,

154
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,800
but I wasn't paying attention to the time.

155
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't want to hear your excuse.

156
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,100
I know, I know. Wait for me, I'll be right there.

157
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,000
There's no need. I guessed you'd be playing Mahjong.

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,900

This is not bothering him. You've totally offended him.

Even though he is Sheng Jingchu,

327

he's still a suspect.

328

But he is in the competition now. It means he has been vindicated from being a suspect.

Grabbing the stones to determine the play order. After both players are seated,

344
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:35,820
the one sitting on the white stones' side will grab a handful of white stones. Watch his hand. He can't reveal the stones.

345
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,730
The player sitting on the black stones' side will take one black stone

346
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,500
to guess if it's an odd number. If he takes two, his guess is an even number.

347

Aren't both of them ranked in ninth dan?

But Yao Ke has the advantage with time.

He is also very familiar with Sheng Jingchu's style in strong kills.

It appears to be a marathon game.

In the second half of the game, if he can delay Sheng Jingchu,

it would be a good strategy.

and starts the first battle. The Three-Space Extension strategy is expected.

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,630
Maybe because Sheng Jingchu's facial expression looks too calm,

476
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,420
I'm not letting go.

477
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,380
I'm in such bad luck today anyways.

478
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,040
Do it then.

479
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,300
Cheng Liao.

480
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,800
It's nice to meet you.

481
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:20,280
♫ The wind blows,
the moonlight breaks through the sea of clouds ♫

482
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,260
♫ The butterflies are like you, understanding clearly ♫

483
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,140
♫ The sounds as summer nights awaken ♫

484
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,560
♫ Black, white, dissipating colors ♫

485
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,720
♫ Reaching out, but can't touch it ♫

486
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,540
♫ That which was beautiful, but long forgotten ♫

487
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:45,010
♫ Because you started to dance ♫

488
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:49,140
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

489
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,960
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

490
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,090
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

491
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:08,030
♫ Flying out from the barren adversity ♫

492
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:20,070
♫ I want to respond to all the good you've given me ♫

493
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:41,700
♫ The clouds float by and hide the sun's brilliance ♫

494
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,790
♫ Waiting for the endless rainy season ♫

495
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,210
♫ All of summer is conversing ♫

496
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:54,030
♫ Sweet, bitter, it's all unknown ♫

497
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:58,090
♫ There is color all around you ♫

498
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,960
♫ Even if going against the wind, you won't back down ♫

499
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,660
♫ It was you who gave me new strength ♫

500
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,700
♫ Found the memories of the smells again ♫

501
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,380
♫ Saying a prayer for love ♫

502
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,500
♫ Your appearance lit up my world ♫

503
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,390
♫ Warmed my rainy nights, called out and made me see ♫

504
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:40,400
♫ That life is like a butterfly, breaking out of the cocoon
and flying far because of your talent ♫

505
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,410
♫ Your existence woke up my past ♫

506
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:50,220
♫ Embraced my future, taught me to become aware ♫

507
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:55,370
♫ No one is a lonely island, running aginst the wind with me ♫

508
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,300
♫ Little dreams are flying high ♫

509
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:15,040
♫ You're my most important treasure ♫
