Of course, we are. Because I believe that the degree of compatibility between people

doesn't only depend on the time spent together to be accumulated,

It can't be anyone else.

159
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,330
We are friends

160
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,030
because you are very precious to me.

161
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,550
Miss Cheng, you called me over here away from my busy work.

162
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,870
Do I only see you looking at the cake without speaking a word?

163
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,400
Encyclopedia Yan, let me ask you something.

164
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,320
If someone can only see the whole world in black and white colors

165
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,800
but only sees you in color,

166
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,160
how would you feel?

167
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,170
Is this some kind of fairytale?

168
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,010
Such a one-and-only, fated destiny, killer set.

169
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,030
I would definitely go crazy!

170
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,350
But the condition is, he must be handsome. If he's not handsome,

171
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,180
let's forget each other then.

172
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,430
If this person can only

173
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,340
see the colors of the world through you,

174
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,570
that's why he would notice you

175
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,460
and then rush to get closer to you,

176
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,950
and tell you that he likes you,

177
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,380
do you think this is love?

178
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,050
Your question is like,

179
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,980
if I am not pretty,

180
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,900
would you still like me?

181
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,440
I have no answer.

182
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,530
It's already at this point, don't tease me.

183
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,820
Okay.

184
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Xiao Cheng, let me be serious then.

185
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,310
Love is something that has tens of thousands of ways to start.

186
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,830
The so-called fate is really just two people

187
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,810
who see each other among all the people for whatever reason.

188
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,860
So, no matter how fantastic it is, it's only the beginning of the story.

189
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,970
But isn't the true feelings and motivation of the story's beginning important?

190
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,820
It's important.

191
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,450
But isn't the journey of the two people getting together even more important?

192
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,260
The heart is something that you can't see or touch.

193
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,530
It cannot be quantified or measured.

194
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,260
So you can only judge it by your own feelings.

195
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,880
Darn.

196
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,980
My head is particularly messed up. I really can't judge it clearly.

197
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,610
When I think about how he's concealed such an important matter from me,

198
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,090
I just can't help but get angry and get sad.

199
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,240
Encyclopedia Yan, if someday,

200
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,900
he can see all the colors in this world,

201
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,340
and he thinks that I'm useless and won't need me anymore, what will I do?

202
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,910
Xiao Cheng, I really do understand you.

203
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,630
People who are in love are always feeling uncertain.

204
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,790
But instead of wondering random thoughts with me right here,

205
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,360
why don't you wait for him to return

206
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,750
and ask him face to face directly?

207
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,810
I will definitely eat the candy you give me.

208
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,520
Eat them slowly. Eat for the rest of your life.

209
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,230
The psychologist told him to get closer to this girl.

210
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,920
It's like taking medicine. Morning, noon, night,

211

at least three times.

212

Therefore, he kept this girl closely by his side.

Why are you suddenly wanting to change the furniture?

228
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,040
Master said previously that my home is too boring, like a sample house.

229
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,540
That's right. Your house is huge, stuffy, and empty.

230
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Even the colors are only black, white, and grey.

231
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,780
I didn't care about those things before

232
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,590
because I couldn't see even if there were other colors. But now,

233
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,720
I want to make a change.

234
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,780
I'll take care of it.

Actually, at that time,

the area of colors that you could see was probably already pretty big, right?
