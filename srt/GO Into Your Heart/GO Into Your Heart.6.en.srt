00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,010
[Episode 6]

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,290
Have you been waiting long?

19
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,180
No, I just arrived.

20
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,910
I didn't want to meet you in the city because there are too many people around.

21
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,200
If I meet you at your apartment, I felt like that might be a bit awkward.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,160
That's why after thinking about it for a while, I decided to meet you by the seaside.

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,580
I come here often.

24
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,760
Do you like looking at the sea?

25
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,290
I have been here before.

26
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,250
When I see too many people, I want to see the sea.

27
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,250
When I look at the sea for a while, I want to see people.

28
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,530
That's right! We are friends, we should see each other more often.

29
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,650
- That's great that you don't mind.
- I don't mind at all!

30
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,150
The purpose of seeing you today was to thank you.

31
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,820
I even brought you a special present.

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,270
I tried it again. I wonder if I got it right this time. Try it!

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,830
Is that the right taste?

34
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,950
Perhaps it really has been way too long,

35
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,260
I've already forgotten the taste.

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,650
That's impossible. It must be my cooking.

37
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,990
I'll go back and try a few more times. I'll definitely make it taste the same as in your memory.

38
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,930
You don't need to be so persistent.

39
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm determined to persist!

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,700
I'm also someone who does what I say I will.

41
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,790
I don't want you to work so hard.

42
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,980
It's not hard at all. You've helped me so much.

43
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,240
I even feel embarrassed to...

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,470
only pay you back with just some food.

45
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,210
For me, that's enough.

46
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,020
Then, have some more.

47
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,990
You're closing Fangyuan Hall just like that?

48
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,790
Can you bear it?

49
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,570
A few years ago,

50
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,120
in order the enlarge the hall

51
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,640
and groom more youngsters,

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,860
I changed Fangyuan into a business model.

53
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,650
And now, the GO Legends Competition

54
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,140
and a few other big competitions have less than satisfying results.

55
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,940
Those people withdrew their investments. What can I do?

56
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,960
I told you early on.

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,970
Respect the teacher and their teachings, pass on the torch. That's the essence of continuing the legacy of GO.

58
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,530
If you want to pass on GO to generation after generation,

59
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,460
you can't do it with business models and fundraising.

60
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,720
You're the only one left in the world

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,260
who leads the disciples and puts up their own money to maintain the hall.

62
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,040
GO should be passed down!

63
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,340
By just you alone?

64
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,810
Just only your hall?

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,970
You let Jingchu leave Jiuzhou Hall

66
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,240
to find some so-called essence of life.

67
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,420
You're still inside that small circle and haven't jumped out of it yet!

68
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,310
He is who he is, and I am who I am.

69
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,580
Old stubborn one!

70
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,150
You old muddled-head.

71
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,980
Is he trying to crash the hall?

72
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,710
Seems... it doesn't seem so.

73
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,690
He looks sad.

74
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,790
That sorrowful gaze, the lonely figure,

75
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,700
just like a tiny boat floating in the big sea. I can't help but—

76
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,940
Talk normally.

77
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,050
It's so awkward watching this!

78
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,880
Eldest Senior Brother, what are you doing?

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,920
Anyone who comes is a guest. I'm delivering some fruit.

80
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,380
Jiuzhou's fruit are for anyone else but him.

81
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,440
It's etiquette to take care of guests. You should be more forgiving.

82
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,920
He's never been forgiving with us.

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,940
Whenever he sees us, he gets jealous.

84
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,310
That's right. Defeating us wouldn't be enough, he'd want to whip the corpse, too.

85
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,990
Luckily my Senior Brother Jing suppressed him.

86
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,670
That makes you low, very low.

87
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,860
Narrow-minded!

88
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,820
Let me tell you. If Master finds out about you two doing this,

89
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,590
he'll definitely send you back to the training group to start over from the beginning!

90
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,270
Mr. Chang'an.

91
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,680
Console Master Jiang.

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,840
Fangyuan Hall has more than ten years of history. To close it would be such a pity.

93
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,140
It's Master's decision.

94
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,850
What does Master Jiang plan to do in the future?

95
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,490
He wants to retire.

96
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,290
What about you?

97
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,720
Me?

98
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,600
What if I come to Jiuzhou?

99
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,840
Has Master decided already?

100
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,630
Actually, the one I worry the most about

101
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,870
is Little Ke.

102
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,550
At six years of age, he started learning GO from me. He's naturally talented.

103
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,580
His temperament is solid and steady.

104
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,580
He's also won Tianyuan before, too.
 (T/N: Tianyuan GO Championship)

105
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,670
If Jingchu didn't appear and rise up,

106
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,450
perhaps he'd still be holding onto Tianyuan now.

107
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,570
He and Jingchu don't get along. I can understand that.

108
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,370
He wants to be a strong GO player.

109
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,110
But he can't cross the high mountain that is Jingchu.

110
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,040
He doesn't lack talent or diligence.

111
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,860
If anyone is to be blamed,

112
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,410
blame me, the master,

113
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,190
who didn't teach him well.

114
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,050
Look at you. What are you saying?

115
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,140
Hangzhou, after thinking it over,

116
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,020
the only one who can help him now...

117
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,420
is you.

118
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,930
Believe me, he'll be a good GO player.

119
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,050
Just accept one more disciple.

120
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,890
Consider it as the last

121
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,100
favor I ask of you.

122
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,920
Look at you, old man Jiang.

123
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,710
The way you're talking, it's like you're acting out a tragic drama.

124
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,350
GO or no GO,

125
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,290
you must promise me this today.

126
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,370
See this? You've already reached this point already.

127
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,480
How can I refuse?

128
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,190
However, there's one condition.

129
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,120
I already haven't accepted disciples for many years.

130
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,430
If Little Ke comes in, he'll be a junior brother.

131
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,050
He'll have to suffer a little. Have you told him?

132
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,540
I've told him.

133
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,190
Even though he feels sad for me,

134
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,370
but he's very happy to learn GO from you.

135
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,790
Being a junior brother or not isn't important.

136
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,450
As long as you agree,

137
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,950
we'll do everything according to the rules.

138
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,650
To Master,

139
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,100
Disciple Yao Ke will

140
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,780
respectfully serve tea.

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,400
Thank you, Master.

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,700
Eldest Senior Brother, drink tea.

143
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Senior Brother Xihe, drink tea.

144
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,500
Thank you, Senior Brother.

145
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,200
Senior Sister Ding Lan, drink tea.

146
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,120
Thank you, Senior Sister.

147
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,000
Little Ke, from now on, you're my disciple.

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,800
From now on, you must get along with everyone.

149
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, Master.

150
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,300
Chang'an, take Little Ke to show him around.

151
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,400
I'm going to accompany your Uncle Jiang.

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Okay. Go ahead, Father.

153
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
Little Ke.

154
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
He's become our junior brother.

155
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,000
Isn't that right? What is Master thinking?

156
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,800
If he takes in a junior brother, why didn't he get a young cutie?

157
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,570
I suddenly think Yao Ke

158
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,200
isn't bad. He'll do.

159
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
You don't hold your ground.

160
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,400
Xiao Lan,

161
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,000
there's a gentle breeze today, the sky is high and the clouds are thin.

162
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
Even the sounds of the birds are so gentle.

163
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,700
What birds?

164
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,300
That's not important.

165
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,000
Should we spend a night together that's as cool as water?

166
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,800
Don't you think intellectual guys are lame?

167
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,000
You say domineering bosses are lame. You also say intellectual guys are lame.

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
What do you really want?

169
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,200
Still so anxious.

170
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,900
I'm not anxious.

171
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Come, come.

172
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,130
Do you think...

173
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,400
Not worth it...

174
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
- Junior Brother.
- Senior Brother.

175
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,460
Everyone's past accomplishments are hung on the wall.

176
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,600
These are Xihe's.

177
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,700
Senior Brother Xihe.

178
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
Little Ke? Little Ke?

179
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Senior Brother.

180
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,400
- There's more here.
- Okay.

181
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,900
On this wall are Father's.

182
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,400
Master's?

183
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,700
But these are just a portion of them.

184
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
These are Jingchu's.

185
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,510
All the trophies on this wall are also Jingchu's.

186
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Jingchu is the pride of Jiuzhou.

187
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,000
Father has always thought that grooming Jingchu was his lifetime's greatest achievement.

188
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,600
Junior Brother, you can look around some more. I'm going to see Master Jiang.

189
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,500
Thank you, Senior Brother.

190
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,600
Sheng Jingchu, we're finally standing on the same starting line.

191
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,400
Starting today, I will understand everything about you,

192
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,400
every bit of it. There will definitely come a day,

193
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,020
when I will thoroughly defeat you.

194
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,900
Junior Brother Yao Ke.

195
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,600
Junior Brother.

196
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,600
I never imagined there'd be a day we'd be at the same hall.

197
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,100
It's my honor.

198
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
Sit.

199
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,590
Hey, Xiao Lan.

200
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,000
When I first entered the hall, what did I give everyone?

201
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,600
You treated everyone to a meal.

202
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,800
Oh yes, I remember now.

203
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,600
I think it was a pretty expensive place, right?

204
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
A seafood banquet!

205
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,500
That's right.

206
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,100
Where did you treat everyone?

207
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,500
Mine was at a Michelin Star restaurant. I forget the name now.

208
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh yes! That was even more expensive than mine.

209
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,800
It was tastefully chosen.

210
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
When you first came to Jiuzhou, how old were you?

211
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I was six.

212
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I was ten.

213
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,900
I'm going to the restroom. You guys talk.

214
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,200
My tummy hurts a little, too.

215
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
How about this?

216
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,100
I'll treat everyone to dinner tonight.

217
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,400
Senior Brother Sheng Jingchu wasn't here either, right? Why not ask him to come?

218
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,200
We can have some fun together.

219
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,300
- I'll arrange it.
- I'll arrange it.

220
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,800
- Master.
- Yes, good, good.

221
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
You eat, eat.

222
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,400
Little Ke, your master and I are close like real brothers.

223
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Following me and following him is the same.

224
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
So, don't feel awkward. If you're thinking something, just tell me.

225
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,500
Master, for me to come to Jiuzhou Hall,

226
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,000
is my honor. This is truly how I feel.

227
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,400
But I especially want to study from you a different realm and thought process in GO.

228
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,600
Listen to that, all of you.

229
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
Your junior brother...

230
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,900
has more insight into GO than all of you.

231
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,100
As a senior sister, about the arrival of Junior Brother Yao Ke,

232
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,300
- I feel it's particularly delicious.
- Huh?

233
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,700
I feel particularly happy.

234
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,900
Come, Junior Brother. Have a drink with Senior Brother.

235
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,400
Look at the two of you, no respect.

236
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
It's because of respect that we say it this way.

237
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Isn't that right, Little Junior Brother?

238
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,800
- Come.
- Good.

239
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Little Ke, do you see now?

240
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,000
Our atmosphere is different from Fangyuan.

241
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,500
The two of them have always been chaotic like flying chickens and jumping dogs since they were kids.

242
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,600
Not serious at all.

243
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,200
Master, I think this is really good; makes everyone closer.

244
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Except for Senior Brother Jingchu who isn't here today.

245
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
He doesn't like the bustle.

246
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,400
He rarely comes to our gatherings. Don't mind him.

247
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,000
Master, I really want to ask you about something.

248
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Just speak.

249
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
All these years, why have you let him

250
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,400
stay independently outside of Jiuzhou Hall?

251
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
He... entered our hall at the age of six.

252
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,400
He stayed cooped up inside and hardly ever went out.

253
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I didn't want him

254
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,200
to have only GO in his head.

255
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,200
So I had him leave to find life.

256
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Consider it my assignment for him.

257
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
If there comes a day

258
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,600
when his mental state changes,

259
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,000
the state of his GO playing will also change.

260
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,400
Morning, Sister Yi.

261
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,000
Hi, Sister Yi.

262
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,100
- Hi, Sister Yi.
- Morning.

263
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Cheng Yi, this collaboration with Pinecone Video

264
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,400
is all because of your accomplishments.

265
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,200
I was groomed by Binhai Station, so it's also my duty.

266
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,600
I asked you to come to discuss something.

267
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,800
The station's leadership wants to develop new people.

268
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,500
Since this program is a collaboration with an internet company,

269
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,000
we can consider

270
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
using some new talent who are recognized on social media.

271
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,310
Of course, you're still

272
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,600
the first choice for the host.

273
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,800
Whether it's fame or capability,

274
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,400
it should be you and none other.

275
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,200
However, your Cheng Yi Conversation is facing revisions.

276
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,900
The recent ratings aren't that good.

277
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,600
They've fallen a little too sharply.

278
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,800
The station's leadership is concerned that you're distracted by the new program.

279
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,500
So, after discussing with Pinecone Video's executives,

280
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,200
they want you to co-host it with Pinecone's Lisa.

281
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,500
Lisa?

282
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,200
Someone who doesn't even possess basic professionalism wants to co-host with me?!

283
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,600
I can discuss this in more detail with Pinecone.

284
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,200
There's no need for further discussion.

285
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,000
I know where my career focus should be.

286
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Cheng Yi Conversation was the top feature for the station and it will continue to be.

287
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,700
I don't have any objection to the station leadership wanting to promote new people.

288
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,800
I've done everything that I could help with.

289
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,400
Next, let's wish the program's production to be successful.

290
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
You go ahead.

291
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,400
Cheng Yi!

292
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Cheng Yi!

293
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The station's leadership wants to develop new people.

294
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So, after discussing with Pinecone Video's executives,

295
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,400
they want you to jointly host with Pinecone's Lisa.

296
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,140
Xiao Yi? Wash your hands and come eat.

297
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,970
Older Sis, I heard that

298
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,820
your program is now hosted by Lisa.

299
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,410
Is that right?

300
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,580
No! Why? That program

301
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,200
was custom made for you by Brother Xu Chi.

302
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,100
Xiao Yi, how's your program coming along?

303
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,690
Is it confirmed?

304
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,100
Filming is about to start soon.

305
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,550
That's great.

306
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,630
I've been watching Cheng Yi Conversation all these years.

307
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,220
I want to change my taste a little, too.

308
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,600
I was never that interested in entertainment shows.

309
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,130
You two go ahead and eat. I have to make some calls.

310
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,730
Don't say anything anymore.

311
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,510
Is it not confirmed yet?

312
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,240
All the VIP guests have arrived,

313
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,800
except for Ke Jie.

314
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,160
Hey! Hey!

315
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,600
Ke Jie's arrived. He's at the entrance.

316
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,330
Hurry and take him to the dressing room.

317
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,980
- I take him?
- If not you, then who else?

318
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,320
Hurry.

319
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,590
This is the dressing room arranged for you.

320
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,980
Okay.

321
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,710
You're that... Cheng Liao.

322
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,460
Right?

323
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,190
Have I introduced myself to you before?

but most of the audience came for Sheng Jingchu.

In a bit, when he gets on stage,

455

the atmosphere will probably be even better.

456

She has a strong ability in distinguishing sound waves. She's broken many records on other programs.

489
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,920
To ensure the difficulty level, I painstakingly selected 30 people

490
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,280
- who have very similar voices to record.
- She graduated from the London School of Economics.

491
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,130
She excels in voice recognition. Her challenge will be to identify which person the sound belongs to.

492
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,940
Next, we'll play a recorded series of thirty men speaking

493
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,090
the same sentence with noisy background music.

494
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,220
And then randomly choose four of them speaking another sentence.

495
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,880
Our competitors Lu Yiting and AI Bai Ze need to, within the shortest time,

496
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,750
accurately choose the numbers assigned to the four men in the recording.

Okay, now it's time to reveal the answers.

[Lu Yiting] [Bai Ze]

504

Her time was very short and faster than Bai Ze's.

505
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,310
But unfortunately, one of the serial numbers is wrong.

506
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,470
Therefore, in the second round, it's still

507

AI Bai Zi who's the winner!

That girl is good. So fast.

I was listening along. Even though I got all of them right,

512
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,400
but I was still slower than the AI.

513

Do you think I'm as good as a voice recognition master then?

514

Mr. Sheng, we're seeing each other again so soon after Suzhou.

530
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,790
I think Mr. Sheng has forgotten me already, but that's quite normal.

531
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:48,970
After all, we weren't in the same frame. Fortunately, we can make up for it today. Mr. Sheng,

532
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,320
within the required time, you have to

533
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,690
memorize all the faces and corresponding fingerprints on the giant screen.

534
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,970
And then we will scramble the sequence of all the fingerprints.

535
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,660
After that, you'll be given three photos

536
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,400
- and will need to accurately locate their corresponding fingerprints.
- Okay.

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,780
Mr. Sheng, the previous two challengers both failed.
