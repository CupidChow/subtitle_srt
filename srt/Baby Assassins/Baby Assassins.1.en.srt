1
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:05,981
Well...

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:10,023
I've been a frequent customer of
this store for some time.

3
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:14,856
I felt the atmosphere was very good.

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,273
I applied for this job because the working
environment is really good.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,815
Also, it said I can take this
as a side job.

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,566
And... this.

7
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,233
This...

8
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:30,358
WELCOME TO HAPPINESS MART!

9
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:33,733
I liked this sign very much!

10
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,566
You did?

11
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:38,900
I made it.

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,901
Oh, I see.

13
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,359
Don't touch it too much.

14
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:46,234
Sorry.

15
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:49,193
I thought it was really...

16
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:50,901
cool.

17
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:52,984
Is that so?

18
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,985
So your name is Mahiro Fukagawa...

19
00:00:57,818 --> 00:00:59,527
What else do you do for a living?

20
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:01,443
Well...

21
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:03,693
Video streaming...

22
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,319
Oh, you live stream.

23
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,444
It's all the rage these days.

24
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,611
YouTube or something?

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,070
Yes.

26
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,444
That's my main job...

27
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:16,153
Main job?

28
00:01:18,654 --> 00:01:21,695
A gameplay or something like that, right?

29
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,946
Something like that...

30
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:26,321
I see.

31
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:29,112
My son was playing video games
all the time,

32
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:30,530
and I scolded him.

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,363
And he said, "I'm going to make
some money out of this!"

34
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:37,738
I said back to him, "You want a job
playing games? Stop daydreaming!"

35
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,696
And then I threw his computer away.

36
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,280
Oh, I see.

37
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:45,947
You can't play around
all the time either, okay?

38
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,489
You need to get a better job.

39
00:01:49,197 --> 00:01:51,989
You're the one who would regret it
in ten years or so.

40
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:54,573
What do your parents say about your job?

41
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,615
What?

42
00:01:57,323 --> 00:01:59,448
They don't have any particular opinion.

43
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:01,823
You have to take care
of your parents, okay?

44
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,448
Family comes first, you know.

45
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:07,907
- I love this quote of Hiroshi Nohara's.
- Yes.

46
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,324
"Dreams don't run away."

47
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:12,741
"It's always you who runs away."

48
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,242
I was really moved.

49
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:17,367
It's so deep.

50
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:22,033
That's probably not what
Hiroshi Nohara said.

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,201
Anyway.

52
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:30,492
Let's see. How many times a week
would you like to work?

53
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:33,867
About three days...

54
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,868
What about a late-night shift?

55
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:38,409
I need someone working at late night.

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,826
That's fine.

57
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:42,660
I see.

58
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,118
What about a weekend shift?

59
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:53,494
So?

60
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:55,203
Is that "No"?

61
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,453
Well...

62
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:59,036
What?

63
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,537
What's going on?

64
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,995
I can't do this anymore...

65
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:06,954
What?

66
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:08,537
What did you say?

67
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,538
I'm tired of this kind of conversation.

68
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:12,329
What?

69
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,371
What do you mean?

70
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:16,746
You're in the middle of a job interview.

71
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:19,955
- I'm not good at going undercover.
- What?

72
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:21,746
- I can't stand it.
- What?

73
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:23,497
- Let them get mad at me later.
- What is it?

74
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:24,288
What?

75
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:31,455
All right. Good job!

76
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:32,872
I have to take a picture.

77
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,915
Say cheese!

78
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:43,623
Okay.

79
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,123
Good.

80
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,374
Oops.

81
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:53,415
What shall I eat for dinner?

82
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:58,791
What?

83
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:00,999
They know I'm here.

84
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,416
You fucking killed our manager? You bitch!

85
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,000
He's been working without sleeping!

86
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,334
Thank you very much!

87
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,917
It said, "Any harm to the other clerks
is unavoidable..."

88
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:15,875
Yeah.

89
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:17,543
Yes, it does.

90
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:20,168
Mr. Tasaka can do the cleaning.

91
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:22,168
I don't think the police is around.

92
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:23,584
All right.

93
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:27,544
Let's do this.

94
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,210
We'll avenge the manager ourselves!

95
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:31,585
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

96
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:35,044
What kind of convenience store is this?
Disgusting...

97
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,045
Hey!

98
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:12,964
I'll kill you!

99
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:29,006
Hey!

100
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:44,508
I'm so exhausted.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,883
- Thank you for calling.
- Oh, no.

102
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,801
- Shimabukuro from Happiness speaking.
- It got smeared.

103
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,467
This store is

104
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:01,176
closed as of today.

105
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:04,343
So please don't call us
when I'm fucking busy.

106
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,260
Hey!

107
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,260
What the hell

108
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:13,301
am I supposed to do with our
work shifts from tomorrow?

109
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:14,885
What?

110
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:20,177
Whatever.

111
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,970
You must be exhausted...

112
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,720
but let's have another match.

113
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:45,346
This is my favourite one...

114
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,430
Such a big dude...

115
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:55,393
That hurts!

116
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,768
This is for my manager!

117
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:06,227
Hey?

118
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,352
They almost got you.

119
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:10,561
You were here?

120
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:13,811
Wasn't the plan to get a job
and infiltrate before killing him?

121
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,228
You almost got killed.

122
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:17,645
So?

123
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:20,853
You pride yourself on your strength,
don't you?

124
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,396
We're assassins, so do your job right.

125
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:30,187
Yes, ma'am.

126
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,646
Good.

127
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,063
Okay.

128
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:41,897
Listen. I was getting annoyed
with the manager.

129
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,272
No wonder
you wanted to kill him right away.

130
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:46,689
He started telling me
Hiroshi Nohara's wise words.

131
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,439
- And that wasn't quite his word.
- What the heck?

132
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:53,314
"Dreams don't run away.
It's always you who runs away."

133
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,106
He said that with a serious look.

134
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:58,398
When telling horror stories,
that type of person says:

135
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:02,898
"It's not the ghosts that really scare me,
it's the people."

136
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:04,524
- Right!
- Yeah?

137
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:07,274
One more typical phrase.

138
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,566
"The opposite of love is not hate,
it's indifference."

139
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:14,233
- He'd definitely say something like that.
- I thought the same thing.

140
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:20,692
I had afternoon tea in the morning!
Would he say something like that?

141
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,817
That's not that funny.

142
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:23,817
No?

143
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:29,192
You know, you go to a crowd and you say,
"Look, people look like garbage."

144
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:33,276
He'd tweet lines from movies
on the Friday night TV show, you know.

145
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:45,569
See?

146
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,277
The manager was weird.

147
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:51,361
Can you believe he threw
his kid's computer away?

148
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:52,735
Miss?

149
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,695
Are you listening?

150
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,861
Can you take shifts on weekends?

151
00:09:59,194 --> 00:10:00,695
Are you listening?

152
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:01,945
Hey, you!

153
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:05,112
Ouch! That hurts!

154
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:11,029
Oh, I'm sorry!

155
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,071
It's just a habit...

156
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,654
What kind of habit is that?

157
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,529
This really hurt!

158
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:19,405
About the shift...

159
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,363
What?

160
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,071
I can work on weekends.

161
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:24,446
Who the hell hires you?

162
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:25,822
I'm sorry...

163
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:29,030
This really hurt!

164
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:35,573
Get out!

165
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:38,614
Sorry.

166
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:12,367
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey.

167
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:13,784
Thanks for coming!

168
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:14,867
Here you go!

169
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:15,826
What?

170
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:19,326
Thank you very much!

171
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,867
- Let me come in.
- Okay.

172
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,493
Wow.

173
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:27,201
That's grotesque.

174
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:30,119
I was told to make it as gory as possible.

175
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:32,369
I see.

176
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:34,452
So we're not doing this for Mr. Tasaka?

177
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:35,327
No.

178
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,786
They're busy so we have to dismember
some of the bodies ourselves this time.

179
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,619
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah...

180
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,453
He's so high and mighty but
sloppy on instructions.

181
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,495
Right.

182
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:47,453
How was your interview?

183
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:50,996
Oh, the manager was so annoying
that I had to put him down.

184
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,453
It happens.

185
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:53,829
That happens a lot.

186
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,288
I saw this nail stripper in When They Cry!

187
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:58,620
Yeah, the one Mion uses.

188
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,246
Wasn't it Shion?

189
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:01,830
How did you get this?

190
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:03,288
From Amazon.com.

191
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:05,122
Amazon is awesome.

192
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:11,539
Such a bad timing!

193
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:14,038
Let's finish this already.

194
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,997
Hurry!

195
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,706
Hurry up!

196
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,622
Can you shut your mouth, please?

197
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,248
Can't you see I'm talking over the phone?

198
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:23,498
Yes.

199
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:26,290
Yes. I got it.

200
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,248
Okay. Thank you.

201
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:32,707
It was the manager of the restaurant.

202
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:33,957
Your part-time job?

203
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:37,207
She said Ms. Masuoka's son had a fever.

204
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,624
I was asked if I can work today.

205
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,000
So you said no, right?

206
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,874
You've got to be kidding me.

207
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,041
This is your main job!

208
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,667
You ditch this for your side job?

209
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:55,500
I mean, now? In this situation?
What are we going to do about this guy?

210
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,042
We even bought the nail stripper!

211
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:02,750
The manager is having a holiday
after working 27 days in a row.

212
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,418
That's not your business.

213
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,793
That's your side job.
Are you listening to me?

214
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:07,876
Are you?

215
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:16,502
Okay, just go!

216
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,127
Thank you very much!

217
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,377
I'll buy you something nice tonight!
Forgive me!

218
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:21,377
Enough.

219
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:24,669
Thank you again!

220
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,669
Hey, finish him before you leave.

221
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:28,128
Oh, my bad!

222
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:31,044
- Do you mind if I borrow your gun?
- Why?

223
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,753
Mine was stolen.

224
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,753
Thank you very much!

225
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:41,045
All right, see you later!

226
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:47,879
That's sloppy.

227
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:55,797
LUNCHTIME PASTA
FOR FREE

228
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,589
Hi.

229
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,547
Forgot your shirt?

230
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,339
I couldn't bring one cause I didn't
have time to stop by home.

231
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:11,256
I've heard Ms. Masuoka's son
is having a fever.

232
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:12,965
She's having a tough time.

233
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,715
Being a single mother, you know.

234
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,257
You wear too much perfume.

235
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:18,965
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:20,465
Don't waste your time!

237
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,966
- Yes.
- I'll let you arrange some dessert.

238
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:24,382
Okay.

239
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,091
Finish that waffle first.

240
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:29,258
Waffle?

241
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,009
Here we go!

242
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,135
Done!

243
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,927
Waffle...

244
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,427
Here you are.

245
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:06,635
Do it again.

246
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:12,761
Now...

247
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,428
Would you want to eat this?

248
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:19,178
I don't think you would. Do it.

249
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:38,014
Is there any trick to this?

250
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,598
- Let me show you.
- Yes!

251
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:49,723
Give it to me!

252
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:51,764
I'll do it.

253
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:53,973
- Move away.
- Okay.

254
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,140
Pass me the mango.

255
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,390
It's right over there.

256
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:00,265
Mango? Okay!

257
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,557
- It's right over there!
- Okay.

258
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,515
It's right in front of you!

259
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:08,308
Yes, mango...

260
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,349
Mango...

261
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,932
It's right in front of you!

262
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,224
Right in front!

263
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,766
Get me mango!

264
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,600
Do you know what mango is?

265
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:20,017
Yes!

266
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:21,100
Right in front!

267
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,475
No!

268
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:23,683
Mango.

269
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,809
- Mango...
- Mango, don't you know what it is?

270
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:27,726
Oh, my gosh!

271
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:29,434
- Sorry!
- Here!

272
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,101
This is mango.

273
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,059
Sorry!

274
00:16:41,143 --> 00:16:42,893
Don't apologize to me.

275
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:46,560
Mango...

276
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:08,312
What a drag!

277
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,354
Three, four...

278
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:22,022
Four days a week. I can work early
in the morning, late night, and weekends.

279
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:23,980
Yes...

280
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:27,439
Interview? Yes.

281
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:30,272
Yes, okay...

282
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:43,690
What a drag!

283
00:17:58,316 --> 00:17:59,399
Good job!

284
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:01,275
Yes!

285
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:10,026
Wow, cool!

286
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:15,234
Here you go!

287
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:17,151
- Thank you!
- Wow, that looks really good.

288
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:18,484
Wow!

289
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:21,276
- Enjoy your waffle!
- Thank you!

290
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,484
But I don't like whipped cream...

291
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:25,610
So you can have it.

292
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,526
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

293
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:30,277
What the fuck is your problem?

294
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:32,861
What?

295
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:37,360
What? Hey!

296
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,028
What the hell are you doing?

297
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:46,153
What?

298
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:49,820
I'm sorry!

299
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,528
What the hell?

300
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:53,862
- I'm so sorry!
- What?!

301
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,195
I'm sorry!

302
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:25,073
Mahiro!

303
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:28,865
I got canned!

304
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:32,574
I shouldn't have been there
if it was going to be like this.

305
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:36,907
All I wanted was to help them
and look what happened.

306
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:38,991
How did this happen?

307
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:43,116
You deserve it after leaving
the dead body.

308
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:46,742
Our main job is killing...

309
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:49,074
You didn't set up my plates.

310
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:51,265
Why do we have to get a
part-time job anyway?

311
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,646
We're assassins, you know.

312
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,284
We kill people so we don't have to get
those annoying jobs.

313
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:58,992
Wow, that looks good!

314
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:02,784
Hey,

315
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:05,826
I didn't even get paid for the job!

316
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,035
Do you think they'd pay me?

317
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:09,993
No, I don't think so.

318
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:12,493
Forget it. It's only about 20,000 yen.

319
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,368
What a drag!

320
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:15,994
I hate it!

321
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:27,244
What's that sound you're making?

322
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,870
Imitating the sound of a dog
walking on a wooden floor.

323
00:20:32,953 --> 00:20:34,287
That's too much pepper.

324
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:34,995
Do you want one?

325
00:20:34,995 --> 00:20:36,746
I don't like spicy food.

326
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,120
Can't you eat spicy food?

327
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,662
You're such a child.

328
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,079
I didn't say I can't eat it.

329
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:46,288
The logic of saying that disliking
spicy food is a child isn't valid.

330
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,038
It's a matter of likes and dislikes.

331
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,288
That's "Spi Hara."

332
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:50,455
What's "Spi Hara"?

333
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,204
Spicy food harassment.

334
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:57,164
You're spicy-food-harassing me,
left the dead body. You suck.

335
00:20:57,496 --> 00:20:59,039
Don't get mad at me.

336
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,247
Come on!

337
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:01,372
I said I'm sorry.

338
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:03,539
Poking on the cheek!

339
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:06,081
- Poking oden in the cheek!
- Stop it...

340
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,291
I'm so geeked!

341
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,875
Are you eating oden with bread?
That's crazy...

342
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,416
Oden matches bread.

343
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,499
Here you go!

344
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,292
An apology gift.

345
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,083
An apology gift...

346
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,250
This bread can't be the true nature of...

347
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,834
What? Don't scare me.

348
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:48,460
What's "true nature"?

349
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,293
I mean the true nature of my anger
is somewhere else.

350
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:53,543
Do you get that?

351
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,960
I feel like I'm being misled
by this bread.

352
00:21:57,418 --> 00:21:59,336
What's with you? Don't be a prude.

353
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,419
So you don't need this bread.

354
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:05,544
I didn't say I didn't want it.

355
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:07,252
Let my hands go. It hurts.

356
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:16,670
I'll have this bread but
you need to apologize to me first.

357
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:23,253
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:33,546
Yummy.

359
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,255
Yes.

360
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:39,297
Thanks for the preparation.

361
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,172
I just wanted to eat oden.

362
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:46,505
I'm so exhausted.

363
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:52,548
I lost my part-time job.

364
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,256
There is a tax hike. Japan is screwed.

365
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,923
Right you are.
It's all the government's fault.

366
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:01,381
They're the ones to blame.

367
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,965
Oh, I feel like shooting my machine gun.

368
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,049
We won't have a job using one for a while.

369
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,215
What did I buy that for?

370
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,383
Oh,

371
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:22,550
20,000 yen...

372
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:26,051
You're still not over it yet.

373
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,593
Thanks for waiting Kaoru.

374
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:36,801
Shall we?

375
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,427
You smell so good, Kaoru.

376
00:23:42,302 --> 00:23:43,385
Are you wearing perfume?

377
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:44,718
Yes.

378
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,093
Cool!

379
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,469
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

380
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,677
Hello, everyone!

381
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:02,762
Oh, what are you doing?

382
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:13,095
Push it in!

383
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:15,971
Oh, the gun!

384
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:18,554
Good!

385
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:21,305
Any blood on my shirt?

386
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:22,263
No.

387
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:23,764
- Okay?
- Okay.

388
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,805
- Somebody definitely saw us!
- Okay.

389
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:28,597
- Don't you think so?
- Okay.

390
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:30,056
Okay.

391
00:24:30,222 --> 00:24:32,431
Please take care of the rest.

392
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,389
Yes. Talk to you later.

393
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,139
Hey, that's too much!

394
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:41,723
You've got to get rid
of the gunpowder smell.

395
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,723
That was close.

396
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:47,390
Mr. Tasaka would be furious.

397
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,641
I hate him.

398
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:49,641
Yeah.

399
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:53,141
- All right. We did a good job.
- Yeah.

400
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:55,724
Let's hurry. The movie will
start in a few minutes.

401
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:57,515
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

402
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,974
Good that we've already
bought the tickets.

403
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:01,016
Yes!

404
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:04,141
- It's freezing out here!
- It is.

405
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:09,142
Thank you for your work yesterday.

406
00:25:09,683 --> 00:25:13,643
Mr. Tasaka wanted to talk to you directly
about how you handled the dead body.

407
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:15,100
You'll hear from him later.

408
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,392
Again?

409
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:19,101
What's with him? We did our job anyway!

410
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:23,601
One more thing. Are you two ready to live
together after graduating high school?

411
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:27,226
- What?
- What? Two of us? Live together?

412
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,852
Yes. That's our company policy.

413
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:34,477
The crew members are supposed to be
independent after graduation.

414
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,102
I've explained that to you two before.

415
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:41,019
Stop calling us "crew."
We don't work for McDonald's.

416
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,686
So can't I stay
at the place where I live now?

417
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:44,603
What?

418
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:49,562
No. You two need to learn how to live as
a member of society. So get a job

419
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:52,020
aside from your main job as assassins.

420
00:25:52,187 --> 00:25:54,771
After graduation,
you'll be a member of society.

421
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:56,562
That's nothing special.

422
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:59,229
I don't want to have a part-time job!

423
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:01,687
I mean, I definitely can't do housework.

424
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:04,730
That's why you two live together
and cooperate.

425
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,355
Our support service expires by next week.

426
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:12,189
We've been issuing the notices
over one year.

427
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:13,356
The notice?

428
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:17,397
Oh, that piece of paper? I never read it.

429
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:20,147
- I don't read that sort of stuff.
- Me neither.

430
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,147
You should.

431
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:26,440
Didn't you two say that you wouldn't even
take the college entrance exam before?

432
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:30,523
Anyway, get a part-time job,
and live together.

433
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,690
Hi, there...

434
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:38,815
Nice to meet you.

435
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:40,274
What's that weird vibe?

436
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:44,191
It's hard to live together
all of a sudden. You know.

437
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:47,733
We need to feel ready for it, Mr. Susano.

438
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,317
Take the key of your new apartment.

439
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:54,734
We've already rented the right place
for you two. It's all furnished.

440
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:58,901
You'll take care of the rest of the stuff
like utilities and others.

441
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:10,443
Resident tax?

442
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,069
Tax return?

443
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:17,152
Health insurance?
I didn't learn any of these at school.

444
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:22,778
Send me the tax documents and our
accountant will take care of everything.

445
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:26,819
What scares us is not cops
but people from the tax office.

446
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,111
Anyway, I'll give you a quick explanation,
so please listen carefully.

447
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,195
First of all, the rent is due on the 27th.

448
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:40,779
The rent will be automatically deducted
from your account, so...

449
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,029
They really kicked me out!

450
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,363
Sorry, I'm late.

451
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:47,821
So where is our new apartment?

452
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:49,946
It's here.

453
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:56,405
Somewhere close to Ueno.
The nearest station is Uguisudani.

454
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:58,614
What?

455
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:00,864
Uguisudani?

456
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:02,697
There is nothing but love hotels.

457
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,781
I wanted to live in Shimokitazawa.
You know.

458
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,698
So how do we pay the rent again?

459
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:15,907
Who knows?

460
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:21,240
Mr. Susano
was giving you the instructions.

461
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,115
What? I thought you were listening to him,
so I didn't hear anything.

462
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:30,741
What? I thought you were listening to him,
and I was thinking something else.

463
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:32,033
You're so irresponsible!

464
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:34,116
So are you!

465
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:41,950
Which way?

466
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:44,451
- This way.
- Okay.

467
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:53,326
Those girls who walk home.

468
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:56,826
I mean those girls who like to walk home.

469
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:58,327
Most of them are mentally ill.

470
00:29:00,494 --> 00:29:02,285
- We're all mentally ill!
- Shut up!

471
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:03,911
BEAN PASTE
130 YEN

472
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:07,911
Here is your change, three million yen!

473
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:09,495
Thank you!

474
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,911
Three million yen... What the hell...

475
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,453
Hey, let the man enjoy joking.

476
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:16,036
Let me give you something nice, you cutie!

477
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:19,828
What do you like?
Here it is. Take this bean jelly!

478
00:29:19,828 --> 00:29:20,912
Thank you.

479
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:22,245
Thank you very much!

480
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:25,746
We'll be up all night unpacking tonight.

481
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,245
Oh, my gosh.

482
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:30,162
- We won't finish it tonight.
- Yes, we will.

483
00:29:30,162 --> 00:29:31,287
We will.

484
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:34,288
Would you like some dumplings?

485
00:29:38,954 --> 00:29:39,996
Well...

486
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,122
- I'll take the dumplings.
- Okay.

487
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:46,747
Here you go! 300 yen, please!

488
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:49,747
Here you are.

489
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,748
500 yen. Okay.

490
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:55,414
Here is your change, two million yen!

491
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,082
Two million...

492
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:03,707
That's the change...

493
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:06,248
That's very generous of you.

494
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,582
Two million.

495
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,916
I mean.

496
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,833
It's a joke you know.

497
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,375
Don't scare me, please!

498
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,875
What's so funny?

499
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,750
You said the change is two million yen.

500
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:27,750
This is only 200 yen.

501
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:33,709
Give me two million.

502
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:37,418
No, I mean that was...

503
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,043
What should I say...

504
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:40,293
So...

505
00:30:40,502 --> 00:30:42,168
The change was 200 yen,

506
00:30:42,168 --> 00:30:45,126
but I just said 2 million yen
to sound funny.

507
00:30:45,418 --> 00:30:46,835
It's sort of humour, you know.

508
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:47,919
Humour?

509
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,002
Right. It is humour.

510
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:52,919
Humour!

511
00:30:53,211 --> 00:30:56,586
Hey, don't take it seriously.

512
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,836
What's with the humour, you bastard?

513
00:31:00,753 --> 00:31:02,170
Don't you fuck with a yakuza.

514
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:09,379
You said two million, didn't you?

515
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:11,837
What? Am I saying something wrong?

516
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:14,296
Am I wrong? Answer me.

517
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:16,296
No, you aren't!

518
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,921
Get me two million yen
no matter how long it takes.

519
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,296
You got that?

520
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,546
Hey, Dad!
What the hell are you doing here?

521
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:29,797
You want some dumplings?

522
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:32,339
We ain't got time for loafing around.

523
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:33,464
Loafing around?

524
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:35,839
Tojo, the guy who handles
our drugs got killed.

525
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,964
We're in trouble.

526
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:38,839
I'm not loafing around.

527
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:41,298
Whatever, let's go!

528
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,465
A single shot in the forehead.

529
00:31:50,882 --> 00:31:52,674
That's so professional.

530
00:31:52,674 --> 00:31:54,216
It must be some hitman!

531
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,758
So cool!

532
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,384
Dolce & Gabbana?

533
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:12,300
Hey, Daddy!

534
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:15,300
Stop saying "Hey." He's our boss!

535
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,426
Ouch, what the hell?

536
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:21,967
It's lovely to watch sibling rivalry.

537
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:25,635
Stop smiling!
Our man got killed, you know.

538
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:31,885
The Mogi family must have done this.

539
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:33,927
We have to retaliate.

540
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:35,427
Take it easy, Kazuki.

541
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:38,094
We aren't sure who did this yet.

542
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:42,803
Idiots like you start something without
thinking, and disputes get uncontrollable.

543
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:44,095
He's so right!

544
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:47,886
Himari, you take care of this case.

545
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,053
Yes, sir!

546
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,012
Why not me, Dad?

547
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:53,096
I'm making more money than you.

548
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,845
You're nothing but a pimp
for sugar dating or something.

549
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:56,513
What?

550
00:32:56,513 --> 00:32:59,346
Don't put me in the same boat
as you chicks who'd make it on sex.

551
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,471
Don't you dare mock women!

552
00:33:01,471 --> 00:33:02,805
- What?
- Cut it out.

553
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:06,471
Kazuki, what you just said was sexism.

554
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:09,805
Sugar dating is a great way
of making money!

555
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,514
Diversity is the key nowadays.

556
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,847
Yakuza also needs to create a comfortable
working environment for women.

557
00:33:17,347 --> 00:33:19,223
Haven't you seen Ocean's 8?

558
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:20,931
No, I haven't

559
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:25,515
I'll take care of this body
and find the killer, so leave it to me.

560
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:26,932
Don't screw up!

561
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:38,140
You handle this right,
and you'll take over his drug route.

562
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,432
For real?

563
00:33:39,432 --> 00:33:40,891
I'll do my best!

564
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:42,599
I bet you will.

565
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:56,517
Spray some deodorizer on me!

566
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:57,433
Okay.

567
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,476
Thank you.

568
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:09,476
I hate yakuza.

569
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,352
Why is he so high and mighty?

570
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,018
That's the only way he can keep
himself together.

571
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,644
So this hitman...

572
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:21,144
I wonder what's he like.

573
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,602
Can't wait to see him.

574
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:31,853
Don't skip the ending!

575
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,312
That's the important part.

576
00:34:34,312 --> 00:34:37,145
Lack of respect for the staff.
Pay some respect!

577
00:34:37,145 --> 00:34:38,437
Come on!

578
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,104
Take care of the rest!

579
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:47,188
The server is too shitty.
There were only cheaters.

580
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:51,813
Your favourite voice actor
is getting swarmed on SNS.

581
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:53,647
It's okay. It happens all the time.

582
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:56,146
I don't want to go to the job interview.

583
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:59,980
- This is still the beginning.
- Hey.

584
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:03,564
I think I'm doing fine living
with you so far.

585
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,272
Isn't that great?

586
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,231
This is super easy.

587
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,648
Are you listening to me?

588
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,856
What?

589
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:11,023
Look!

590
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:13,190
I'm wrapping up some rice
into small potions.

591
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:15,690
This is quite a technique.

592
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,190
That's great,
but I guess you'll quit soon.

593
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:22,108
Why is the SNS full of bad mouth?

594
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:24,357
I'd definitely take them to court.

595
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,525
Why don't you just kill them?

596
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:35,150
Isn't this noise terrible?

597
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:37,525
Hey.

598
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:41,567
Hey, you over there!

599
00:35:47,526 --> 00:35:48,609
What?

600
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:59,568
Shit, we're screwed.

601
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:02,027
You left the magazine
in the washing machine.

602
00:36:02,402 --> 00:36:03,652
Gosh...

603
00:36:03,652 --> 00:36:06,319
Bullets too.

604
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:11,194
Did we break the washing machine?

605
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:12,611
What do you think?

606
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:16,986
This happens a lot, you know.

607
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:19,320
You often leave
some tissues in the machine.

608
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,696
No, it doesn't!

609
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:25,862
It's really broken.

610
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:30,405
The lid is closed.

611
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:32,737
What about the faucet?

612
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:37,697
Don't put such pressure on it!

613
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,947
What?

614
00:36:41,697 --> 00:36:43,447
My precious washing machine!

615
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:49,155
Thank you for your hard work
all this time!

616
00:36:54,198 --> 00:36:55,407
You give up so fast!

617
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:57,073
How about tapping!

618
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:02,907
- Okay, fuck it.
- Okay!

619
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:06,032
I wonder why those people
start the flames on SNS.

620
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:08,282
Are you still talking about that?

621
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:12,700
Did you get rice?

622
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,908
Don't splash your ramen soup.

623
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:23,950
Sorry.

624
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,534
Be careful!

625
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:27,034
I will.

626
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:42,868
Sorry!

627
00:37:57,453 --> 00:38:01,203
I've got a job interview that day.
Can you do that for me?

628
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:02,203
Sure.

629
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:05,245
Just killing some punks, right?

630
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:06,704
Great!

631
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:09,662
Okay, the meeting is over!

632
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,121
- Shall we?
- Yes.

633
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:15,538
Can you move over?

634
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:21,413
My senior at my part-time
job is really annoying.

635
00:38:21,496 --> 00:38:25,497
This guy always tells me quotes
from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

636
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:29,580
Something like, "But, I won't do that."

637
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,330
When I ask him something,

638
00:38:31,414 --> 00:38:35,289
he says, "Have you ever counted the number
of loaves of bread you've ever eaten?"

639
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:41,123
It's okay if I like JoJo.

640
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:43,748
But I never watched it, you know.

641
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,290
This is good! It tastes right.

642
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,874
Beef tongue sold at wholesale stores
are the best, right?

643
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:56,374
Right. This is good.

644
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,209
Okay, wait.

645
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:24,459
It's okay.

646
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:27,419
- Get in!
- Come here.

647
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:28,627
Come here.

648
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:32,085
- Your cell.
- What?

649
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:34,460
I told you to show me your cell.
Are you fucking deaf?

650
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:37,544
I fucking told you to give me
your cell phone, asshole!

651
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:40,086
- Come on!
- Okay.

652
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:46,378
Have you hired a hitman
to kill a yakuza in Shinjuku lately?

653
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,586
What the hell are you talking about?

654
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,129
Just answer me, you dick head!

655
00:39:51,545 --> 00:39:55,629
It hurts...

656
00:39:55,796 --> 00:40:00,629
No evidence left on the phone?
I wonder what to do...

657
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:03,380
Tell me who did it or you die.

658
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,505
It's me! I hired the hitman,

659
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:10,755
and asked him to kill Tojo.

660
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:12,797
Wow! Bingo!

661
00:40:12,797 --> 00:40:14,422
How did you figure out it's me?

662
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:16,339
We never did.

663
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:19,172
We kept kidnapping the suspects,
and beat them up.

664
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:20,589
You're the seventh guy.

665
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,048
Well...

666
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,506
He asked me if I wanted to
open my own restaurant.

667
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:33,424
I was just saddled with the debt,
and the store was shut down...

668
00:40:34,757 --> 00:40:37,382
So it was all an act
of the yakuza after all...

669
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:41,632
All the girls I cared about were
drugged by these guys.

670
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:43,716
I couldn't let him go like that.

671
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:45,924
And my wife fell ill...

672
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:49,383
Enough of your story.
Save that for the TV show you'd be on.

673
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:51,550
I want to know who you asked to kill him.

674
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,675
- I don't know who did it...
- What?

675
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:57,175
They have a system that can never be
leaked to the outside world.

676
00:40:57,175 --> 00:40:58,175
What?

677
00:40:59,217 --> 00:41:01,968
I'm telling you the truth!

678
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:04,342
Their security is really tight! Seriously!

679
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:07,884
The request form on the website
disappeared after I sent the request!

680
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:10,176
- So you really don't know.
- No.

681
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,969
Did you ask them to kill anybody else?

682
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,635
- Yes. One more guy...
- What?

683
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:18,760
- Who's that?
- Hanabusa...

684
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,885
Oh, Hanabusa! I know him.

685
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:24,177
So if we use him as bait,
we'll know who'd kill him.

686
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:28,970
- That's a good idea.
- Okay, I'll help you do that. I will.

687
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:32,761
So please don't kill me. Please!

688
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:35,095
- Okay, I got you.
- Please!

689
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:38,554
Come with us. We've got some time to kill!

690
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:40,178
Okay?

691
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:41,179
Killing time?

692
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:42,512
Hey, pull over!

693
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:44,304
I told you to pull over!

694
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:45,971
Hey!

695
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:47,430
Pull the fuck over, idiot!

696
00:41:47,513 --> 00:41:49,638
I don't know how I got into this mess.

697
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:51,638
The yakuza is the one to blame...

698
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:54,513
Why the fuck don't you stop the car?

699
00:41:59,097 --> 00:42:01,264
If you beat this guy, you can go home!

700
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:13,724
Okay.

701
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,598
All right!

702
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:18,348
I can do this!

703
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:20,182
I can fucking do this!!

704
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:25,224
You guys think I'm just an old man
hanging around, don't you?

705
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:30,266
I'm famous around here, you know.
Ask anyone about me!

706
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:47,351
What?

707
00:42:48,393 --> 00:42:50,143
He sucks!

708
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:51,727
- Come on.
- He sucks.

709
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:55,601
Bring somebody better.

710
00:42:57,893 --> 00:42:59,560
Won't be long before you see one.

711
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:07,436
Oh, I'm late!

712
00:43:07,436 --> 00:43:11,853
Hey, it's still noon!

713
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:13,602
It's already 2 p.m.

714
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:17,895
You just have to kill
some yakuza today, right?

715
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,520
I was told to break in the moment
he comes back.

716
00:43:21,062 --> 00:43:22,687
So I can't be late!

717
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,438
You'll be fine!

718
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:27,812
I'm doing this for you!

719
00:43:29,104 --> 00:43:31,813
Oh, my gun!

720
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:47,313
It's loaded! Safety on!

721
00:43:47,814 --> 00:43:48,939
See you later!

722
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:52,731
Oh, I forgot my bicycle key.

723
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:55,314
Oh, it was in my hand!!

724
00:43:56,106 --> 00:43:58,815
Lock the door when you leave.

725
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:24,400
This futon feels so good!

726
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,152
I made it!

727
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:47,485
I almost didn't make it. Just in time.

728
00:44:48,193 --> 00:44:50,027
- There is nothing in this room.
- What the hell?

729
00:44:50,027 --> 00:44:52,153
- Who the hell are you?
- Do as I say.

730
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:55,069
Are you kidding?

731
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,778
You think this is a toy?

732
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:01,903
Do you want to try?

733
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:09,945
What? Who the hell are you?

734
00:45:10,195 --> 00:45:11,446
Hi there!

735
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:16,155
Okay, I think I'm in big trouble.

736
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:17,863
She almost got me.

737
00:45:18,071 --> 00:45:20,196
Thank you!

738
00:45:22,863 --> 00:45:24,739
Bingo!

739
00:45:26,488 --> 00:45:29,281
You have a surprisingly pretty face,
you hitman!

740
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:31,448
What's your name, baby?

741
00:45:31,448 --> 00:45:33,156
You reek of alcohol. What do you want?

742
00:45:33,156 --> 00:45:34,489
What?

743
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:41,240
I wasn't expecting someone like you.

744
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,531
Hey, do you want to die?

745
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:47,865
First time using a handgun?

746
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:49,991
You could miss the shot at this distance.

747
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:53,824
You're a funny girl!

748
00:45:53,824 --> 00:45:56,615
I've got a feeling
we're going to get along!

749
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:59,116
I'd love to offer some cleaning jobs.

750
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:00,825
Want to do something fun?

751
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,450
Give me your contact info.

752
00:46:02,908 --> 00:46:04,491
That's just a momentary feeling.

753
00:46:04,908 --> 00:46:06,200
That's not it!

754
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,325
Don't say something like that! Please!

755
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:11,325
Let's do something fun together!

756
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:14,409
Do you use LINE?

757
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:15,659
Sure!

758
00:46:16,743 --> 00:46:17,743
QR code?

759
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:19,534
Right?

760
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:24,535
You didn't have to knock her out.

761
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,118
Come on!

762
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,618
This one sucks too.

763
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,994
How could she be a hitman?

764
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:33,577
I'm concerned about hitman industry.

765
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:36,035
What about this guy?

766
00:46:38,703 --> 00:46:40,745
It'd be pretty convenient
for me if he died.

767
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:42,786
What?

768
00:46:42,786 --> 00:46:45,953
No, you promised to
save me from the hitman.

769
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:47,328
Right?

770
00:47:09,747 --> 00:47:11,913
That bitch is a pain in the ass.

771
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,706
What the hell does she want?

772
00:47:21,998 --> 00:47:22,956
Come on.

773
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:28,998
She took my gun!

774
00:47:29,457 --> 00:47:31,165
I'm so pissed.

775
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:36,665
I'm in a bad mood. Brace yourself.

776
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:47,292
- Put your focus on your target.
- Okay.

777
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:48,458
Help me...

778
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,459
Please...

779
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:52,709
Ready!

780
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:54,125
- Yes!
- All right.

781
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:55,208
Shoot!

782
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,126
Oh, no?

783
00:48:01,126 --> 00:48:02,792
You almost had it.

784
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:05,460
- Everybody misses the first shot.
- Yes.

785
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:08,042
- Let's try again.
- One more time. Yes.

786
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:10,960
- Aim carefully. Take it easy.
- Yes.

787
00:48:15,668 --> 00:48:17,169
I did it!

788
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:19,960
I told you I'm better than Kazuki.

789
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,377
- I'm very handy.
- What?

790
00:48:22,753 --> 00:48:25,295
After all, you didn't get a clue
about the hitman.

791
00:48:27,378 --> 00:48:30,545
Why don't we go to Disney Sea sometime
to appreciate our family bond?

792
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:32,044
That's a great idea!

793
00:48:32,044 --> 00:48:33,462
Hell no!

794
00:48:33,462 --> 00:48:35,420
Let me take over his drug deal.

795
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,712
I'll sell them to my friend rappers
and make good money!

796
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:41,171
That's my girl, Himari!

797
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:42,421
Thank you!

798
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,421
Damn.

799
00:48:51,255 --> 00:48:52,255
Hey.

800
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,088
I thought you had a job interview today.

801
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,963
Didn't you have one?

802
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:58,589
Oh, that?

803
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:04,797
Wait a second. You ditched it, didn't you?

804
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:07,131
You know what?

805
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:10,298
We're not hurting for money.

806
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:15,174
Why do we have to get another job?

807
00:49:15,174 --> 00:49:16,757
Don't change the subject.

808
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,591
I'm going to start my next job today.

809
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:20,424
What?

810
00:49:20,716 --> 00:49:23,382
- Already?
- You'd better find a new one soon.

811
00:49:23,382 --> 00:49:24,632
What...

812
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:38,092
Listen, I have an idea...

813
00:49:38,092 --> 00:49:38,967
Yeah?

814
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:47,217
Do you think I can work
at the place where you work?

815
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:48,843
What?

816
00:49:50,051 --> 00:49:51,926
I don't mind, but...

817
00:49:52,384 --> 00:49:54,343
I wonder if you really want to do it.

818
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:58,343
I wonder what they'd say if
I brought someone else to the interview.

819
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:02,761
I can't do anything alone, you know.

820
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:04,677
I can't do anything.

821
00:50:04,677 --> 00:50:08,677
Maybe I might be able to do something
if you are with me.

822
00:50:08,677 --> 00:50:11,178
- So, please!
- Okay!

823
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,845
I'll give them a call.

824
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,762
You are a lifesaver.

825
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,261
What's with you?

826
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:20,053
Thanks! I can do this!

827
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:22,887
Finally, I'll get a job!

828
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:25,345
Yes!

829
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:33,637
What the hell is this...

830
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:42,722
Hey, you look good!

831
00:50:44,014 --> 00:50:45,805
Let's do a practical test.

832
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,556
Say, "Moe Moe Kyun!"
to this glass of water.

833
00:50:50,598 --> 00:50:52,181
- To this?
- Yes.

834
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:53,848
He's got to be kidding.

835
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:56,473
Okay.

836
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:02,807
Moe...

837
00:51:03,182 --> 00:51:04,891
Moe...

838
00:51:06,348 --> 00:51:07,265
Kyun!

839
00:51:07,682 --> 00:51:08,682
You're up.

840
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:11,057
Okay, you go ahead!

841
00:51:14,683 --> 00:51:15,767
Mo...

842
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:21,184
- Mo...
- Yes. That's it.

843
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:23,476
- Moe...
- Go ahead...

844
00:51:23,725 --> 00:51:25,933
- You can do it.
- Are you okay, Mahiro?

845
00:51:26,892 --> 00:51:29,100
Never mind. She's a bit weird.

846
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,476
You got the job, Chisato.

847
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:33,893
Thank you very much!

848
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,059
What should I do about you...?

849
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:40,018
I'll give it my best shot.

850
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:44,769
Okay, then. You'll observe others today.

851
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,935
- Himeko, I leave the rest to you.
- Okay!

852
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:52,770
Nice to meet you. I'm Chisato.

853
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,686
Hi. I'm Himeko.

854
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:56,644
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

855
00:51:56,644 --> 00:51:58,978
Okay. Let's learn how you
introduce yourself first.

856
00:51:58,978 --> 00:52:00,437
Watch and learn!

857
00:52:01,644 --> 00:52:06,687
Hi! My name is Chamu Chamu.
I'm from another planet!

858
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:08,562
Please call me Chamy!

859
00:52:08,562 --> 00:52:13,354
I'll serve you with all my might.
Pleased to meet you, my master!

860
00:52:14,396 --> 00:52:15,480
Did you get it?

861
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,688
From another planet?

862
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:18,813
Let's give it a try, Chisato.

863
00:52:18,813 --> 00:52:20,730
You might want to be an alien like me.

864
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,480
- Go ahead!
- Go ahead...

865
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,856
I'm from another planet...

866
00:52:34,439 --> 00:52:36,522
- We're home!
- We're home!

867
00:52:41,148 --> 00:52:43,690
Am I going to serve the customer already?

868
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,857
Don't worry. I'll be watching you.
Let's give it a shot!

869
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,648
Thank you for coming, my master!

870
00:52:52,648 --> 00:52:54,483
We've got a new customer!

871
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:55,441
Welcome!

872
00:52:55,441 --> 00:52:56,982
Remember this isn't Izakaya.

873
00:52:56,982 --> 00:52:58,816
Our master is home!

874
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:02,649
Welcome back home!

875
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:07,400
No pop-out!

876
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,233
It's my turn.

877
00:53:10,275 --> 00:53:11,817
No pop-out!

878
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,984
Wow! You're good!

879
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:20,151
My turn.

880
00:53:21,151 --> 00:53:22,693
No pop-out!

881
00:53:23,777 --> 00:53:26,235
No pop-out!

882
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:27,902
You're the man!

883
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:30,943
How can you be like that?

884
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:32,486
No pop-out!

885
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:38,319
No pop-out!

886
00:53:38,486 --> 00:53:41,903
Hey, Mahiro! Take a look at this!

887
00:53:44,528 --> 00:53:46,445
I'm burned out!

888
00:53:47,111 --> 00:53:50,528
You're rich enough to buy a sandwich!

889
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:51,820
What? It's just a sandwich.

890
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,237
I know, it'll cost more than 300 yen.
That's over my budget!

891
00:53:55,446 --> 00:53:56,404
It does.

892
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:59,362
Wouldn't you eat a beef bowl
if you've got 300 yen?

893
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:02,821
Or, you could get a cup noodle
and a rice ball--

894
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:06,071
I never thought about
how much I spent on lunch before.

895
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:07,113
I see.

896
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:10,489
Hey! That's a rice ball with salmon roe!
That costs 200 yen!

897
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,781
That's the most expensive rice ball.

898
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:15,614
You bought smoothies too?
That'd be more than 1,000 yen.

899
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:18,655
You need at least 1,000 yen to be full.
Don't you?

900
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:20,781
Is that so?

901
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:23,406
What?

902
00:54:24,823 --> 00:54:28,490
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, I see...

903
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,531
I guess you're really poor!

904
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:32,449
You're so straightforward.

905
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:35,657
I need to pay my tuition for college.

906
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:39,324
No matter how much I earn,
they're all gone for my living expense.

907
00:54:39,324 --> 00:54:43,241
After all, we all work for money.
We can't make a living without it, right?

908
00:54:43,783 --> 00:54:45,657
Is that so?

909
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,617
Yes.

910
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,867
Well, I know some people can't make
a living even if they got enough money.

911
00:54:54,117 --> 00:54:55,450
Are you all right?

912
00:54:56,575 --> 00:54:58,075
You've got some tissue here?

913
00:54:58,451 --> 00:55:00,034
Let me find one.

914
00:55:00,618 --> 00:55:01,867
Tissue...

915
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:04,451
Where is the tissue?

916
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:05,618
I'm so sorry.

917
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:07,910
Never mind, get her some tissue.

918
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,951
- Thank you for your hard work!
- Thank you!

919
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:13,410
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

920
00:55:16,202 --> 00:55:17,285
Wow!

921
00:55:17,285 --> 00:55:20,077
- This thing tastes amazing!
- It's delicious!

922
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,328
You had one hell of a time doing this job.

923
00:55:23,328 --> 00:55:27,244
I never thought I'd be serving
customers on my first day.

924
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:29,328
Lots of picky customers?

925
00:55:29,328 --> 00:55:31,120
You're too picky!

926
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,620
That's an outdated phrase.

927
00:55:35,953 --> 00:55:38,746
Thank you for throwing me
such a welcome party!

928
00:55:38,746 --> 00:55:40,245
You're welcome!

929
00:55:40,245 --> 00:55:41,579
No more food?

930
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:42,871
Take a look, Himeko!

931
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:46,038
Ta-dah!

932
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:48,621
What? Is this because
I told you I'm stingy?

933
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:50,996
You're such a nice person!

934
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:53,246
You deserve this! You're such a poor lady!

935
00:55:53,246 --> 00:55:54,997
You're so straightforward.

936
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:56,830
It's out of friendship!

937
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:59,080
I'll take this one.

938
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:00,622
Let me try this one.

939
00:56:01,331 --> 00:56:03,914
You speak Kansai dialect.
Where are you from?

940
00:56:03,914 --> 00:56:05,331
I'm from Osaka.

941
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:06,206
Oh, yeah? I'm from Kyoto.

942
00:56:06,206 --> 00:56:08,956
- You're my neighbour, then!
- Wow!

943
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:10,248
How about Chisato?

944
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,123
Somewhere north...

945
00:56:12,207 --> 00:56:14,123
Somewhere north?

946
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:16,248
Somewhere north...

947
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,749
- Somewhere north...
- Somewhere north...

948
00:56:23,457 --> 00:56:24,540
Sorry.

949
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:28,957
Hey, we've got some fruit sandwiches!

950
00:56:28,957 --> 00:56:32,291
Wow, I've been wanting to try that.

951
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:33,291
Never tried this before?

952
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:34,625
Have you?

953
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:37,042
No way, it costs more than 300 yen!

954
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:39,209
You're always talking about money.

955
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,459
I want to try this. Anybody else?

956
00:56:41,459 --> 00:56:43,501
Who wants to eat?

957
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:48,417
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

958
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:53,460
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

959
00:57:19,462 --> 00:57:22,295
I can't get used to that vibe.

960
00:57:34,338 --> 00:57:36,880
I love cats.

961
00:57:38,172 --> 00:57:40,088
They're so cute.

962
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,464
I envy them.

963
00:57:58,882 --> 00:58:01,799
I'm home!

964
00:58:03,882 --> 00:58:05,299
Don't make any sound!

965
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,257
I pulled an all nighter
for the first time.

966
00:58:09,174 --> 00:58:10,591
I'm so sleepy.

967
00:58:11,257 --> 00:58:12,966
Let's take my contact lenses off.

968
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:22,217
Good morning!

969
00:58:23,217 --> 00:58:25,258
Why did you leave?

970
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,342
I had so much fun!

971
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:30,343
Oh, yeah? Good for you.

972
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:34,801
I should have worked at a place like that
from the beginning.

973
00:58:35,259 --> 00:58:38,676
Yeah? Well...

974
00:58:39,551 --> 00:58:41,301
That's not the place for me.

975
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,593
I was so embarrassed dressing like that.

976
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:48,093
So you're quitting again?

977
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:51,344
I think so.

978
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:54,761
Well, it's not going to be beneficial
to my life anyway.

979
00:58:55,386 --> 00:58:59,053
You're just a part-timer
and you're that serious?

980
00:58:59,053 --> 00:59:03,303
I mean, it's hard to get along
with other part-timers for me.

981
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:06,303
Oh, yeah?

982
00:59:07,137 --> 00:59:10,471
I can't do that Moe Moe Kyun thing.

983
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:16,471
Well, you don't have to be able to work.

984
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:19,471
But it would be nice to be
able to communicate at least.

985
00:59:20,347 --> 00:59:22,596
Otherwise, you'll have trouble getting
any part-time job.

986
00:59:23,597 --> 00:59:25,680
What? What's with you?

987
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,680
Well...

988
00:59:28,472 --> 00:59:30,014
I guess...

989
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:32,472
To each their own.

990
00:59:32,555 --> 00:59:35,223
I'm fine with that.

991
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:36,598
I'm fine, but...

992
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:38,723
Yeah...

993
00:59:43,556 --> 00:59:47,432
You sound like the crappy tweeter
who doesn't try anything on her own...

994
00:59:52,015 --> 00:59:56,349
but looks down on those
who are trying and feels comfortable.

995
00:59:56,849 --> 00:59:58,266
I hate that sort of people.

996
00:59:58,516 --> 00:59:59,766
When watching a comedy show,

997
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:02,475
you'd say, "Am I the only one
who didn't find that funny?"

998
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:04,892
"Am I the one who's strange?"

999
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:05,725
Wouldn't you?

1000
01:00:05,725 --> 01:00:07,059
No, I wouldn't.

1001
01:00:07,391 --> 01:00:10,059
I mean, like I said before,
this is about chemistry.

1002
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,934
Say whatever you want.
You're sulking so you better fix it.

1003
01:00:12,934 --> 01:00:14,434
That's it. Well, good night.

1004
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,601
Stop bugging me.

1005
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:29,060
I just...

1006
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,144
I'm only living like this
because it suits me.

1007
01:00:33,144 --> 01:00:35,352
Did I bother you in any way?

1008
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:42,228
Did you two have a fight?

1009
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:43,603
- No.
- No.

1010
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:47,520
Well, let me talk about the next job.
It'll be tomorrow.

1011
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,395
I can't be involved in that.
Let her take care of it alone.

1012
01:00:51,354 --> 01:00:54,395
Okay. How does that sound, Mahiro?

1013
01:00:54,562 --> 01:00:57,854
No problem. Unlike someone,
I'll fulfil my duty as an assassin.

1014
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,021
She's failed job interviews
ten times in a row.

1015
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:01,604
She's got talent for failing.

1016
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:06,146
Just ignore her.
She's been trying to upset me.

1017
01:01:06,772 --> 01:01:09,688
Whatever. Please get along.

1018
01:01:10,438 --> 01:01:14,147
Chisato, don't put your focus too much
on your part-time job.

1019
01:01:14,522 --> 01:01:17,439
Mahiro, you do your best to pass
your next job interview.

1020
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,773
- Okay.
- Okay.

1021
01:01:18,897 --> 01:01:21,397
They say,
"The closer you are, The more you fight."

1022
01:01:21,523 --> 01:01:22,439
No way.

1023
01:01:22,439 --> 01:01:23,898
There is no such thing.

1024
01:01:25,273 --> 01:01:26,273
Okay...

1025
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:37,982
Never thought I'd be walking around
Akihabara with my dad.

1026
01:01:38,398 --> 01:01:40,857
I found some
good business around here, Kazuki.

1027
01:01:41,483 --> 01:01:44,066
Drugs and pimping are outdated.

1028
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:46,566
We're in the era of "Moe."

1029
01:01:47,066 --> 01:01:49,608
What the hell is that? I don't understand.

1030
01:01:50,316 --> 01:01:52,275
You're so inflexible.

1031
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,442
You need to learn new stuff.

1032
01:01:55,192 --> 01:01:58,859
We're going to have to
update our sense of value, you know.

1033
01:01:59,275 --> 01:02:01,776
We'll start a female-centric business.

1034
01:02:03,442 --> 01:02:04,360
All right.

1035
01:02:05,026 --> 01:02:05,901
Let's give it a try.

1036
01:02:07,068 --> 01:02:08,776
Are you serious, Dad?

1037
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:10,819
It's embarrassing to try
this kind of place alone.

1038
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:13,318
It's good that you came with me.

1039
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:16,860
You'd be even more embarrassed
to bring your son.

1040
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,194
You know, in school...

1041
01:02:21,778 --> 01:02:23,945
Welcome home, master!

1042
01:02:23,945 --> 01:02:25,236
Hi.

1043
01:02:30,362 --> 01:02:32,529
I'll show you to your seats.

1044
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:35,821
Our master is home.

1045
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,612
Such a nice place, isn't it?

1046
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:42,363
What do we do in a place like this?

1047
01:02:51,947 --> 01:02:53,321
Can I have my check, please?

1048
01:02:56,489 --> 01:02:58,155
It's crazy expensive.

1049
01:02:58,155 --> 01:02:59,781
They charge 2,000 yen for an omelet!

1050
01:02:59,781 --> 01:03:02,781
I told you, this would be good business.

1051
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:04,197
Isn't it too late to...

1052
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,906
Allow me to introduce myself!

1053
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:08,198
My name is Chamy! I'm from another planet!

1054
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:11,240
I'm so excited
to serve you today, masters!

1055
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:12,865
Hello.

1056
01:03:14,406 --> 01:03:15,907
I'll have an iced coffee.

1057
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:18,490
I'll have a rice omelet.

1058
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,074
Hey, master!

1059
01:03:20,074 --> 01:03:23,574
Please read out what's exactly written
on the menu, sir!

1060
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,075
"Wah, wah, wah."

1061
01:03:35,075 --> 01:03:36,908
"Kids should stay away from it."

1062
01:03:36,908 --> 01:03:39,659
"One bitter iced coffee
for an adult, please."

1063
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:42,034
Thank you sir! A glass of iced coffee!

1064
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:43,243
You're calling it iced coffee?

1065
01:03:43,243 --> 01:03:44,617
How about you?

1066
01:03:44,617 --> 01:03:45,951
Dad, you don't have to...

1067
01:03:47,784 --> 01:03:51,952
Chick's pom poko-tweet tweet
rice omelet, please.

1068
01:03:52,284 --> 01:03:53,201
Dad...

1069
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:55,284
Certainly, master!

1070
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:00,285
Kazuki.

1071
01:04:01,077 --> 01:04:03,494
This is what you're supposed to enjoy.

1072
01:04:04,118 --> 01:04:06,202
It's quite a fun place. Isn't it?

1073
01:04:11,536 --> 01:04:13,411
Here you are.

1074
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:16,036
Thank you for waiting.

1075
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:18,787
Would you like some syrup for your coffee?

1076
01:04:18,787 --> 01:04:19,995
Please.

1077
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:21,578
Yes, sir!

1078
01:04:21,578 --> 01:04:26,704
Allow me to cast a spell that will make
this syrup taste even better.

1079
01:04:26,954 --> 01:04:29,655
When I say "Moe Moe"

1080
01:04:29,855 --> 01:04:34,121
please repeat "Moe Moe" back.

1081
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,663
- Okay.
- Okay.

1082
01:04:36,746 --> 01:04:38,080
Are you ready?

1083
01:04:38,163 --> 01:04:39,038
One, two, three!

1084
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:40,664
Moe Moe!

1085
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:42,080
- "Moe Moe!"
- "Moe Moe!"

1086
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,163
Huli-huli!

1087
01:04:43,163 --> 01:04:44,330
- "Huli-huli!"
- "Huli-huli!"

1088
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,622
Shake!

1089
01:04:45,622 --> 01:04:47,039
- "Shake!"
- "Shake!"

1090
01:04:47,206 --> 01:04:49,498
May the syrup be tasty!

1091
01:04:49,498 --> 01:04:51,914
- "May the syrup be tasty!"
- "May the syrup be tasty!"

1092
01:04:51,914 --> 01:04:54,164
Moe Moe Kyun!

1093
01:04:54,164 --> 01:04:56,873
- "Moe Moe Kyun!"
- "Moe Moe Kyun!"

1094
01:04:59,207 --> 01:05:01,123
You know what? This is sort of fun!

1095
01:05:01,123 --> 01:05:02,207
I told you so.

1096
01:05:02,623 --> 01:05:04,915
This is a fun place!

1097
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:09,207
Wow, now the coffee is under a spell!

1098
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:10,499
Master!

1099
01:05:10,499 --> 01:05:15,458
I can draw on the rice omelet.
What would you like me to draw?

1100
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,333
With ketchup?

1101
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:19,333
Yes!

1102
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,208
How charming!

1103
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,917
Then, write "Yakuza" with Kanji.

1104
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:25,209
No way, Dad!

1105
01:05:25,209 --> 01:05:27,209
Can you give me some easier characters?

1106
01:05:27,459 --> 01:05:30,459
- How about "Code of Conduct" with Kanji?
- Let's give it a shot!

1107
01:05:43,836 --> 01:05:46,293
Excuse me, my master...

1108
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:49,585
It's a bit hard.

1109
01:05:52,253 --> 01:05:53,752
Dad, this is impossible!

1110
01:06:11,212 --> 01:06:12,754
What's so funny?

1111
01:06:13,629 --> 01:06:15,462
We've been mocked!

1112
01:06:19,004 --> 01:06:22,672
I've been patiently listening to your
silly talk. What the fuck is "Moe"?

1113
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:25,630
Do you want me to send you to Hades?

1114
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:29,755
Let's go home, Dad.
It wasn't our place to come.

1115
01:06:29,755 --> 01:06:32,256
They're making fun of us,
yakuza, don't you get it?

1116
01:06:33,714 --> 01:06:34,840
Calm down...

1117
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,506
Sir, how can I help you?

1118
01:06:38,048 --> 01:06:39,798
You're in charge here?

1119
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,423
No, sir!

1120
01:06:45,465 --> 01:06:46,674
Kazuki,

1121
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:48,715
let's take these girls!

1122
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:50,966
You girls line up!

1123
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:53,674
Where did your idea of female-centric
business thing go?

1124
01:06:55,424 --> 01:06:58,174
Fuck it! I don't give a shit anymore.

1125
01:06:58,174 --> 01:07:00,049
You girls, do whatever I say!

1126
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,424
Hurry up!

1127
01:07:01,883 --> 01:07:03,216
Line up!

1128
01:07:03,508 --> 01:07:04,967
Line up in a row!

1129
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:06,800
Hurry the fuck up!

1130
01:07:09,008 --> 01:07:11,925
Some of the girls
would be good money if we sell them.

1131
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:14,926
How about this one?

1132
01:07:20,176 --> 01:07:22,134
You smell good! Don't you?

1133
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:25,885
All right!

1134
01:07:26,468 --> 01:07:27,760
Turn around and face the wall!

1135
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,010
Face the fucking wall!

1136
01:07:30,094 --> 01:07:31,344
Hurry!

1137
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:35,261
Stick your ass out!

1138
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,344
Hey!

1139
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:40,803
You...

1140
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:45,178
Do you want to die?

1141
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:46,470
Do you?

1142
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:55,887
Kazuki...

1143
01:07:57,471 --> 01:07:58,762
Kazuki!

1144
01:07:58,762 --> 01:07:59,929
This isn't real.

1145
01:08:00,638 --> 01:08:03,054
Gun!

1146
01:08:03,054 --> 01:08:04,888
Somebody, bring me my gun!

1147
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:11,638
Don't look back.

1148
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:14,514
Don't look this way and leave the room.

1149
01:08:15,514 --> 01:08:16,973
No need to call the police.

1150
01:08:17,597 --> 01:08:18,973
Nothing has happened.

1151
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:21,931
Things will be back to normal by tomorrow.

1152
01:08:24,056 --> 01:08:25,098
Hurry up!

1153
01:08:42,641 --> 01:08:44,016
I've got to call Mr. Tasaka.

1154
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:55,433
It was such a mess you made!

1155
01:08:55,517 --> 01:08:57,517
I'm sorry.

1156
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,851
I've got to call some support!

1157
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:05,434
Anyway, just like the last time
in Shinjuku.

1158
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:08,935
Let's make this look like a battle
between yakuza clans.

1159
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:09,977
Sounds good!

1160
01:09:10,143 --> 01:09:15,852
Good. You need to fill out the form
before we get to work.

1161
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:23,853
Since you're personally using the service
this time, insurance won't cover it.

1162
01:09:23,936 --> 01:09:26,894
If anything happens to either of us,

1163
01:09:26,978 --> 01:09:33,770
you will bear
all criminal responsibility. Okay?

1164
01:09:33,854 --> 01:09:35,270
Do you have your stamp?

1165
01:09:35,353 --> 01:09:36,854
- I don't have it with me now.
- Oh, you don't.

1166
01:09:36,937 --> 01:09:38,187
Your signature will do.

1167
01:09:41,604 --> 01:09:42,979
Thank you very much!

1168
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:45,813
Here is the quote.

1169
01:09:45,813 --> 01:09:46,729
Okay.

1170
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:48,272
Keep it. It serves as a receipt.

1171
01:09:48,437 --> 01:09:49,521
Wow! That's pricey!

1172
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:52,272
No, it's not!

1173
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:56,856
This is how much it costs when you
personally use the service.

1174
01:09:56,856 --> 01:10:03,356
As you know, extra charges arise
when cleaning up yakuza and politicians.

1175
01:10:03,356 --> 01:10:04,605
I see.

1176
01:10:04,605 --> 01:10:06,273
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1177
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:11,481
Excuse me but...

1178
01:10:11,565 --> 01:10:12,439
You know what?

1179
01:10:13,273 --> 01:10:15,481
When using guns,

1180
01:10:16,065 --> 01:10:18,482
would you not aim at the head?

1181
01:10:19,691 --> 01:10:22,357
I've been telling you this all the time.

1182
01:10:22,357 --> 01:10:23,274
Aim at heart, right?

1183
01:10:23,274 --> 01:10:24,607
Right. Aim at heart.

1184
01:10:24,607 --> 01:10:27,566
You may think we're some kind of handymen.

1185
01:10:28,066 --> 01:10:31,358
- But we're only human, you know.
- Yes.

1186
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:37,233
So it'd be nice if you could
keep that in your mind.

1187
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,358
I've been wanting
to tell you this for a while.

1188
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,401
- I totally understand!
- Okay.

1189
01:10:44,234 --> 01:10:46,192
I didn't mean to complain, but

1190
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:51,985
I don't think that being an assassin is
just a job that requires killing people.

1191
01:10:51,985 --> 01:10:53,985
- I mean, this is my personal opinion.
- Yes.

1192
01:10:54,277 --> 01:10:56,485
You two are doing this job
as professionals.

1193
01:10:56,485 --> 01:11:00,318
Professionals have their own way
of doing things, you know.

1194
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:18,903
You said you'd take me to Disney Sea!

1195
01:11:30,571 --> 01:11:31,779
Dolce & Gabbana?

1196
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:35,530
It must be that girl.

1197
01:11:35,946 --> 01:11:38,280
Fuck! She's the one.

1198
01:11:47,197 --> 01:11:48,030
Hey.

1199
01:11:48,614 --> 01:11:49,823
You're home.

1200
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:51,614
Yes.

1201
01:11:59,407 --> 01:12:01,198
Well...

1202
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,657
Well...

1203
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:12,533
What?

1204
01:12:13,408 --> 01:12:14,616
I'm sorry.

1205
01:12:16,449 --> 01:12:20,367
About everything.
My attitude, and you know...

1206
01:12:21,284 --> 01:12:23,075
Don't worry about it.

1207
01:12:25,325 --> 01:12:26,701
Listen,

1208
01:12:28,033 --> 01:12:29,117
I...

1209
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,492
I don't really fit in with society.

1210
01:12:33,993 --> 01:12:35,576
I don't want to fit anyway.

1211
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:37,410
And I don't think I could.

1212
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:42,285
I don't even think it's something
I have to face, at all, anyway.

1213
01:12:42,994 --> 01:12:44,577
You know why?

1214
01:12:45,202 --> 01:12:46,910
It's not for everyone.

1215
01:12:48,452 --> 01:12:50,744
It's not for me.

1216
01:12:51,077 --> 01:12:53,077
I don't think I have to face it.

1217
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:57,287
Right, you are.

1218
01:12:58,245 --> 01:12:59,661
I think that's fine.

1219
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,745
But...

1220
01:13:04,161 --> 01:13:05,328
Well...

1221
01:13:05,704 --> 01:13:07,079
From now on,

1222
01:13:08,203 --> 01:13:13,787
I'd like to face you, Chisato.
You're someone rather important, you know.

1223
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:17,788
So...

1224
01:13:19,121 --> 01:13:23,663
I'm really sorry about yesterday

1225
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:29,497
that I said you're wasting your time on
your part-time job or something like that.

1226
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:32,622
And one more thing.

1227
01:13:33,289 --> 01:13:36,497
You got me the bread

1228
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:41,665
but I said that's not
the true nature or whatever...

1229
01:13:41,748 --> 01:13:43,206
I'm really sorry for that.

1230
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:48,249
I spent some time thinking
about how I would repay you.

1231
01:13:49,374 --> 01:13:51,249
Getting you some cake was the only idea...

1232
01:13:52,124 --> 01:13:53,249
Oh, this piece of cake?

1233
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,082
Yes...

1234
01:13:56,124 --> 01:13:59,624
It'd be great if we could
enjoy them together.

1235
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:10,375
Good job!

1236
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:14,001
- You've learned how to apologize properly.
- What are you doing?

1237
01:14:14,001 --> 01:14:17,917
- I'm sorry for making you feel so lonely.
- I didn't feel lonely.

1238
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:19,376
Let's eat the cake.

1239
01:14:21,793 --> 01:14:25,668
We've got two pieces!

1240
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:28,085
Here you are!

1241
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:29,918
All right!

1242
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,128
Let's eat!

1243
01:14:48,378 --> 01:14:49,336
One moment.

1244
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,795
Just a second.

1245
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:54,254
Hello?

1246
01:14:56,546 --> 01:14:57,629
What?

1247
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,212
Who's this?

1248
01:14:59,921 --> 01:15:02,088
The yakuza who you just killed today.

1249
01:15:02,504 --> 01:15:04,088
That's my father.

1250
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,380
Are you listening?

1251
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,213
Yes.

1252
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,338
I just sent you where I am now.

1253
01:15:11,714 --> 01:15:13,422
Get your ass here right away!

1254
01:15:14,131 --> 01:15:15,172
What?

1255
01:15:15,422 --> 01:15:17,839
Why the hell am I supposed to get there?

1256
01:15:18,506 --> 01:15:20,548
Why don't you come here?

1257
01:15:21,548 --> 01:15:23,381
Anyway, how did you find out it's me?

1258
01:15:25,548 --> 01:15:26,548
What?

1259
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:28,631
What do you mean?

1260
01:15:30,132 --> 01:15:32,465
The smell of Dolce & Gabbana perfume?

1261
01:15:35,883 --> 01:15:37,340
You freaking bitch!

1262
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,299
What?

1263
01:15:39,382 --> 01:15:42,174
You're the one who started this,
so you get your ass here!

1264
01:15:42,174 --> 01:15:45,924
All right then, I'll get there
and kick your sweet butt!

1265
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:48,341
Prepare yourself!

1266
01:15:49,925 --> 01:15:51,174
Mahiro...

1267
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:54,758
I've got a favour to ask.

1268
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,717
Well...

1269
01:15:57,301 --> 01:15:58,717
Would you help me with this?

1270
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:00,843
Now?

1271
01:16:01,843 --> 01:16:06,634
Yes. Consider me as one
of your clients, you know.

1272
01:16:07,509 --> 01:16:09,968
Help me kill these yakuza.

1273
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,510
Make a raid on the yakuza's office?

1274
01:16:16,302 --> 01:16:19,052
And it's personal, right?

1275
01:16:24,052 --> 01:16:26,136
Are there lots of staff?

1276
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,595
Yes! We've got a lot to kill.

1277
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:31,970
Oh, yeah?

1278
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,304
And you need my help?

1279
01:16:37,512 --> 01:16:39,137
Please!

1280
01:16:42,429 --> 01:16:45,221
- Just this one time!
- Yes!

1281
01:16:47,013 --> 01:16:48,638
Let me move the cake.

1282
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:57,847
Cool!

1283
01:16:59,264 --> 01:17:02,347
Hey, you moved my gun, didn't you?

1284
01:17:03,222 --> 01:17:04,723
No, I didn't.

1285
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,723
You said you change where you hide
it day by day.

1286
01:17:11,681 --> 01:17:14,806
Come on, I totally forgot where I hid it.

1287
01:17:15,557 --> 01:17:17,098
I wonder where it is.

1288
01:17:17,473 --> 01:17:18,515
Well...

1289
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:20,807
Thank god, you're a lifesaver.

1290
01:17:23,099 --> 01:17:24,724
You're taking the machine gun?

1291
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:26,266
I probably won't use this.

1292
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:27,974
Just in case, you know.

1293
01:17:34,725 --> 01:17:36,975
Then, I got punched in my face...

1294
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:39,975
- And they took my gun.
- Holy crap...

1295
01:17:39,975 --> 01:17:44,059
Then I killed his father.

1296
01:17:44,434 --> 01:17:48,726
She must be so furious...

1297
01:17:49,518 --> 01:17:51,310
You should've told me that earlier.

1298
01:17:56,435 --> 01:17:58,102
We'll both survive this.

1299
01:17:58,102 --> 01:18:00,393
Let's eat the cake after we're back home.

1300
01:18:12,811 --> 01:18:15,769
Hey, do you think it's okay
to park my bike here?

1301
01:18:15,769 --> 01:18:17,228
I guess so. It's late at night.

1302
01:18:17,353 --> 01:18:18,770
Are you sure?

1303
01:18:21,395 --> 01:18:23,395
Oh, I almost forgot my machine gun!

1304
01:18:23,896 --> 01:18:25,437
It was close!

1305
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,563
Okay, let's do this!

1306
01:18:38,022 --> 01:18:39,563
Hey, guys!

1307
01:18:42,105 --> 01:18:43,772
Is Mr. Watabe here yet?

1308
01:18:44,856 --> 01:18:45,856
No...

1309
01:18:45,939 --> 01:18:46,939
Okay.

1310
01:18:47,314 --> 01:18:49,981
I never understood
why he works for a yakuza.

1311
01:18:49,981 --> 01:18:51,772
I really don't understand.

1312
01:18:53,565 --> 01:18:54,898
You don't have any weapons?

1313
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,939
Yeah, it's easier to fight like this.

1314
01:18:58,398 --> 01:19:01,899
You guys shoot as much as you want
but never shoot me.

1315
01:19:16,774 --> 01:19:19,442
How dare you girls
come to a place like this?

1316
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:24,859
Better go to Shibuya for shopping.

1317
01:19:27,109 --> 01:19:28,192
Who's this?

1318
01:19:28,276 --> 01:19:29,276
Who cares?

1319
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:32,568
You look like you're ready to fight.

1320
01:19:33,651 --> 01:19:35,818
I like that kind of spirit.

1321
01:19:38,943 --> 01:19:39,985
Come on!

1322
01:19:47,277 --> 01:19:48,694
What the hell was that?

1323
01:20:46,656 --> 01:20:48,115
I'm glad you made it!

1324
01:20:48,198 --> 01:20:51,073
That's my gun! Give it back to me!

1325
01:20:51,073 --> 01:20:52,115
Shut up and die!

1326
01:20:52,115 --> 01:20:56,616
By the way, this is your brother's gun.

1327
01:20:58,283 --> 01:20:59,824
You're inflaming her anger.

1328
01:20:59,824 --> 01:21:02,116
Don't worry about it.
I brought that machine gun...

1329
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:10,159
- Wait a second! I dropped it somewhere!
- Oh, come on!

1330
01:22:19,289 --> 01:22:21,998
She should have told me about
this crazy strong guy!

1331
01:25:09,053 --> 01:25:10,386
I'm burned out!

1332
01:25:11,428 --> 01:25:12,761
I'm so exhausted.

1333
01:25:13,386 --> 01:25:15,929
What the hell... He was good!

1334
01:25:17,845 --> 01:25:19,845
I should have brought bombs or something.

1335
01:25:22,346 --> 01:25:23,887
Who's this guy anyway?

1336
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,888
Whatever. Let's ask Chisato later.

1337
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:44,931
I'm screwed!

1338
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,348
Yes!

1339
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:50,181
I finally got you! Yeah!

1340
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:52,181
Your water bottle is

1341
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:53,973
broken.

1342
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:55,848
Your drink is leaking.

1343
01:25:58,265 --> 01:26:00,265
Oh my gosh!

1344
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:03,641
My daddy's keepsake!

1345
01:26:03,932 --> 01:26:05,182
Damn it!

1346
01:26:07,682 --> 01:26:10,682
Thank you for being so stupid!

1347
01:26:18,224 --> 01:26:19,391
So cool!

1348
01:26:19,391 --> 01:26:22,600
- Finally found you, my sweet machine gun!
- You almost shot me.

1349
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,351
I missed you!

1350
01:26:25,142 --> 01:26:26,892
Hey, you're there!

1351
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:29,142
How did you do it? Cakewalk?

1352
01:26:32,768 --> 01:26:35,809
There was this one guy
who was freaking strong.

1353
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,894
I thought I was going to die.

1354
01:26:48,352 --> 01:26:50,602
Why the hell are you laughing?
You're scaring me.

1355
01:26:51,769 --> 01:26:53,102
Are you all right?

1356
01:26:58,144 --> 01:27:00,811
I don't want to get blood on my hands...

1357
01:27:02,103 --> 01:27:03,354
Let's get you up!

1358
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,103
Thanks.

1359
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:09,854
Let's go home.

1360
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:14,104
This is mine!

1361
01:27:16,438 --> 01:27:19,605
Did you see how I shot that machine gun?

1362
01:27:20,772 --> 01:27:22,605
That was so cool!

1363
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,480
Good for you!

1364
01:27:25,147 --> 01:27:26,189
You want to give it a try?

1365
01:27:27,272 --> 01:27:29,272
NOTICE:
ABANDONED BICYCLE REMOVED

1366
01:27:29,272 --> 01:27:30,314
Come on!

1367
01:27:31,689 --> 01:27:32,939
Let's walk home.

1368
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:43,607
Let's go home.

1369
01:27:46,231 --> 01:27:47,482
We look like we're drunk.

1370
01:27:48,732 --> 01:27:50,440
Yes! We do.

1371
01:28:12,734 --> 01:28:16,026
Mr. Tasaka must be upset
cleaning those 24 dead bodies.

1372
01:28:16,318 --> 01:28:18,318
He was very sarcastic.

1373
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:22,109
He even called me to complain about you.

1374
01:28:22,443 --> 01:28:27,693
Well, now it's a busy season
that we need support from Kansai area.

1375
01:28:27,693 --> 01:28:29,110
He must be pretty busy too.

1376
01:28:29,818 --> 01:28:32,194
It's a good thing you're
on salary until you turn 20.

1377
01:28:32,611 --> 01:28:37,945
You would never have saved 22 million
if there wasn't a reserved fund.

1378
01:28:38,527 --> 01:28:41,153
You've spent most of them anyway
for this cleaning.

1379
01:28:42,945 --> 01:28:45,861
I was going to buy the Batmobile
when I turn 20.

1380
01:28:45,861 --> 01:28:47,654
What do you buy that for?

1381
01:28:47,861 --> 01:28:51,236
Anyway, you two lost
your part-time job again.

1382
01:28:58,862 --> 01:28:59,946
You know what?

1383
01:29:01,071 --> 01:29:04,196
Let me get this straight.

1384
01:29:04,613 --> 01:29:09,947
I can't be a member of society
because I'm a sociopath.

1385
01:29:09,947 --> 01:29:11,697
I've learned that.

1386
01:29:12,489 --> 01:29:17,530
I like this job pretty much...

1387
01:29:20,281 --> 01:29:21,490
You're so straightforward.

1388
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:22,948
I really can take it, you know.

1389
01:29:22,948 --> 01:29:24,698
I agree with her.

1390
01:29:24,698 --> 01:29:28,406
She's shy and has communication problems.
No way she can handle normal jobs.

1391
01:29:28,698 --> 01:29:31,323
Are you backing me up or what?

1392
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:36,491
I get that. I know some people are really
into killing and can't do anything else.

1393
01:29:37,115 --> 01:29:40,407
Someone from Kyoto who came to me
recently was just like you.

1394
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:42,658
Oh, yeah?

1395
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,033
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

1396
01:29:46,033 --> 01:29:49,075
Get a driver's license instead.

1397
01:29:49,116 --> 01:29:51,492
You can register as a driver at least.

1398
01:29:52,075 --> 01:29:54,992
Driver's license...?

1399
01:29:54,992 --> 01:29:56,492
I don't think she can.

1400
01:29:56,867 --> 01:29:58,700
I'll give it a shot!

1401
01:29:59,368 --> 01:30:00,784
I don't want to work.

1402
01:30:00,784 --> 01:30:02,743
I can do it!

1403
01:30:03,117 --> 01:30:05,201
So about you two...

1404
01:30:05,743 --> 01:30:08,576
Our managers are concerned
about you guys lately.

1405
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:12,369
They're saying maybe it's a bad idea
to make you two live together.

1406
01:30:12,952 --> 01:30:15,577
That could be the cause
of huge stress, you know.

1407
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:19,202
You two could live separately
if you want to.

1408
01:30:31,828 --> 01:30:34,286
- Well...
- Well...

1409
01:30:35,912 --> 01:30:37,496
- We'd like to...
- We'd like to...
