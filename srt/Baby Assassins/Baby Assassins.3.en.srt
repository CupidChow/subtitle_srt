1
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,449
I found you!

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,286
You’re it!

3
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,551
Welcome back.

4
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:34,969
How’d it go?

5
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,349
Need a towel?

6
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,060
I have one.

7
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,450
We’re on the last stretch now.

8
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,287
[Tsuyoshi Matsuura]

9
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,623
[Last One]

10
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,172
I’m scared!

11
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,632
I’m gonna die!

12
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,925
We’re having fun!

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,763
This is awesome!

14
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,266
Let’s go faster!

15
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,606
I’m gonna fall in!

16
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,530
Help! Sharks!

17
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,074
It splashed me in the face.

18
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,743
You saw the shark, didn’t you?

19
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,537
There was no shark.

20
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,705
Yes there was!

21
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,249
Everyone run! Be careful!
- Stop.

22
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,208
Come on.

23
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,086
My eyes hurt. Cancel the hit?

24
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,254
No silly!

25
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,339
What was that?

26
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,593
Hey, feel my hair.

27
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,094
It’s frizzy.

28
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,179
It’s all sticky.

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,140
Cha-cha-cha.

30
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,976
This is the real cha-cha.

31
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,897
I’m beat.

32
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,900
I wanna go home.

33
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,781
At least Mahiro’s having fun.

34
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,701
Here comes a wave.

35
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,289
Look at her run away,
like a little kid.

36
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,248
Whoa!

37
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,709
I found a huge jellyfish!

38
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,492
I’m beat.

39
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,537
Well, here we are in Miyazaki.

40
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,790
Yeah.

41
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,293
It sure is Miyazaki.

42
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,797
Nice to go on a trip again.

43
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,388
Just to get away from the bustle
of the city and feel the warm breeze.

44
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,641
Remember, we’re here on business.

45
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,145
Sure, but our job yesterday
took no time at all.

46
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,192
18 HOURS EARLIER

47
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,312
Good job.
- You too.

48
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,064
All done?
- All done.

49
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,399
That was close.
- Thanks.

50
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,943
I thought I was cooked
when they took my gun.

51
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,196
Yeah, about that.

52
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,032
When you’re up against a guy,

53
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,784
you gotta pull in...

54
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,035
Oh, thanks.

55
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,995
Don’t just go in head-on.

56
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,413
You’ve got blood.

57
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:17,251
You gotta use their momentum,
and pull them in like this.

58
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,378
Fine.

59
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,714
Were you listening to me?

60
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,633
I see how it is.

61
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,346
You think you can handle fistfights...
Oh, thanks. ...better than me, right?

62
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,349
Hey, did you book our haircuts?

63
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,519
Yeah, I did. Next Sunday.

64
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,062
Thanks.

65
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,191
I thought you were growing it out.

66
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,112
Well, I’m thinking of going for...

67
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,781
How do you say, a lighter look?

68
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,159
I’m thinking about a wolf cut.

69
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,369
The fancy kind.

70
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,830
There’s “fancy” and “not fancy”.

71
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,957
So I’ll probably do that.

72
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,959
Like the 90s style?

73
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,547
Exactly, And I know
you can’t go on your own.

74
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,053
Let’s talk the whole time
so the stylist won’t talk to me.

75
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,806
Get them to seat us together.

76
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,433
Just talk to her.

77
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,728
Snip snip.
So, what do you do on your days off?

78
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,107
Just hang around home.

79
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,608
Oh, you’re a homebody.

80
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,778
That’s no good. You’ll get sick.

81
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,323
I go for barbecue with my friends
all the time.

82
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,033
You’re a lousy stylist.

83
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:36,789
See, there are types like that who
find excuses to talk about themselves.

84
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,960
And when you say something
they go “Uh-huh.”

85
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,422
Uh-huh
- Yeah, just like that.

86
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,466
It’s melting!
- Mango.

87
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,553
Wow, this is nice!

88
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,524
I know right?

89
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,943
What more to say?

90
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,239
What’s there to say about trips?

91
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,618
Nice to take a load off.

92
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,953
Yeah, Wanna order food?

93
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,539
No, snacking will ruin your appetite.

94
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,916
Wait for dinner.

95
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,960
Good point.

96
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,838
I’ve got a reservation
for Miyazaki beef.

97
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,590
Beef?

98
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,135
I can’t wait!

99
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,223
We had to work
right after we landed yesterday.

100
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,308
Nothing was open after that.

101
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,060
So let’s make up for it.

102
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,396
We’re gonna eat till we drop!

103
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,440
Yeah!

104
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,533
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

105
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,994
<i>I totally forgot</i>
<i>today’s Mahiro’s birthday!</i>

106
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,207
<i>She’s gonna be expecting something</i>
<i>at dinner tonight, isn’t she?</i>

107
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,917
Waiters bringing a cake?

108
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,627
<i>But she once tweeted,</i>

109
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:10,007
<i>“If I got a birthday surprise,</i>
<i>I’d get so embarrassed I’d shoot myself.”</i>

110
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,179
<i>Wait. But she went</i>
<i>all out for my birthday.</i>

111
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,848
<i>But I didn’t even get her a present.</i>

112
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,018
<i>I totally forgot.</i>
<i>Shit, shit, shit!</i>

113
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:21,978
That scared me!

114
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,064
Time for work.

115
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,148
Already?

116
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,900
Time to focus.

117
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,696
Let’s get it over with
and back to sightseeing.

118
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,823
Okay.

119
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,785
Open.

120
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,663
Ta-da!

121
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,207
<i>Thanks for coming down.</i>

122
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,836
<i>This was a job for Mr. Hanazome,</i>
<i>Tokyo’s top assassin.</i>

123
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,172
<i>but he was sick and couldn’t make it.</i>

124
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,591
<i>The client asked</i>

125
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,637
<i>for skilled assassins from Tokyo,</i>
<i>and your names came up.</i>

126
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,891
<i>Cleanup’s already booked.</i>
<i>You just have to do the killing.</i>

127
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,435
<i>Target: Tsuyoshi Matsuura.</i>

128
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,646
<i>The client wants him</i>
<i>dead for embezzlement.</i>

129
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,817
<i>He’ll be at Miyazaki Prefectural Office</i>
<i>for the prospect of a fake passport.</i>

130
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:14,572
<i>It’s a day off, so only cleaning staff and tourists will be there.</i>

131
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,536
Glad this job
doubles as sightseeing.

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,579
Wrong.

133
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,373
Sightseeing doubles as the job.

134
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,716
I hear they have good lobster in Miyazaki

135
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,802
Really? Better than in Ise?

136
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,555
Ise, that’s in Mie, right?

137
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,100
But beef’s already on the menu tonight.

138
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,936
Thanks. Maybe next time.

139
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,481
Let’s try Ise lobster too.

140
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,690
Yeah.

141
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:29,980
What?

142
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,148
What?

143
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,733
Who’s he?

144
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,318
Help me!

145
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,570
Please don’t kill me.

146
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,158
So, uh...

147
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,705
Who are you exactly?

148
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,499
Uhh...

149
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,169
Are you a competitor or something?

150
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:57,508
So I’m just guessing, but are you, maybe,

151
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,302
an assassin, too?

152
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,849
I guess we got double-booked then, huh?

153
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:09,103
Is he with the guild?
No, guess not.

154
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,897
Maybe he’s a freelancer.

155
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,817
Don’t ruin this.

156
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,445
Excuse me?

157
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,822
Don’t ruin this!

158
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:26,036
I was just about to finish my last job.

159
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,622
Finally made it to 150.

160
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,208
So don’t ruin this moment for me!

161
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,087
Oh. Pardon me.

162
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,298
Sorry to bother you.

163
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,632
I understand.

164
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,676
You seem pretty cheesed off.

165
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,429
so we saw nothing
and we’ll ask Mr. Susano.

166
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,684
But if we let a freelancer go free,
that’ll affect the guild’s reputation.

167
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,269
Really? Reputation?

168
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,353
Listen!

169
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,689
Oh, scary.

170
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,566
He’s trouble.

171
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,486
Do you have any idea

172
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,156
how long I’ve been waiting
for this day to come?

173
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:04,950
Cut the crap!

174
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,496
What a mess, huh?

175
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,818
I got this.

176
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,736
Okay.

177
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,095
You’re bleeding really bad.

178
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,098
Wipe it off.

179
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,228
Hurry.

180
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,375
Stop making me run.

181
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,275
Come on! Don’t do that to me!

182
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,363
I thought I was dead.

183
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,348
Are you okay?

184
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,725
Let me see.

185
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,605
The target?

186
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,776
He got away
when that guy stopped me.

187
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,820
Who is he, anyway?

188
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:23,949
What’s that?

189
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,910
He gave it to me.

190
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,209
I’m supposed to be an assassin,
but I couldn’t kill him.

191
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,006
I even accepted his charity.

192
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,052
I don’t deserve...

193
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,265
to be an assassin

194
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,274
It doesn’t matter now.

195
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,529
At least you’re alive.

196
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,325
Really?

197
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,250
Up we go.

198
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,544
Can you stand?

199
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,798
Up we go!

200
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,517
Sorry I left you.

201
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,951
He’s back.

202
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,411
Can you move?

203
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,288
Leave me and save yourself.

204
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,583

206
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,853
Chisato Sugimoto and Mahiro Fukagawa.

207
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,732
Uh, yeah. That’s us.

208
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,860
How can we help you?

209
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,446
Excuse me!

210
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,824
Gotta get my protein.

211
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,576
No chicken salad.

212
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,162
No chicken steak. What to do?

213
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,121
Two coffees.

214
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,205
Two coffees?

215
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,293
No coffee for me. Coffee on
an empty stomach’s bad for muscles.

216
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,461
Orange juice.

217
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,504
Orange juice? Right away.

218
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,423
One moment.

219
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,597
You just encountered an assassin
named Kaede Fuyumura.

220
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,100
He’s a freelancer,
and a loose cannon at that.

221
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,644
A gun and knife expert.

222
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,858
Whoa. he’s a freak.

223
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,362
What a string bean.

224
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:50,989
What?

225
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,366
The guild put out a hit on him.

226
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,995
They’re furious a freelancer
stole a target.

227
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,457
and ruined their image to their client.

228
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,002
It was your screw-up, so you get the hit.

229
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,088
End of story. Any questions?

230
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,925
Wait, us?

231
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,138
Well, actually, we’re on vaca--

232
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:18,892
I mean, a job.

233
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,523
We were gonna finish this job,
then go have a little fun.

234
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,817
After the job’s done.

235
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,655
Then we wanted to look around and head back home...

236
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,662
Typical Gen-Z.

237
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,499
Don’t smoke. It’s bad for you.

238
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,509
They just don’t take responsibility.

239
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,760
Besides,

240
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:59,266
this never would’ve happened
if they’d taken him out to begin with.

241
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,395
Did she just tut-tut us?

242
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,189
Kids these days...

243
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,651
They just don’t have any pride as assassins.

244
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,572
What are you muttering about?

245
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,949
Can’t say it to our faces?

246
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,202
No sense of honor.

247
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:23,039
Honor? Like the samurai? Is that a special?

248
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,709
You play pachinko?

249
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:26,876
I see.

250
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,504
You wouldn’t get it.

251
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,965
Anyway, this is a job.

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,343
Wow, this lady’s scary!

kills Matsuura, then kill Matsuura.

254
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,766
Okay?

255
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,269
Don’t kill Matsuura first.

256
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,063
The order matters.

257
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,024
Them’s the rules.

258
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,277
Let’s do it.

259
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,738
I want...

260
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,282

What’s gotten into you?

262
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,411
I just don’t wanna back down.

263
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,332
I’ll give it my best shot.

264
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:11,504
By the way, we’re going to act
as a team of four.

265
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,089
What?

266
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,382
With you?

267
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,510
Okay, then I quit.

268
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,554
Too late. You just agreed.

269
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,097
I regret it.

270
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,266
The name’s Riku Nanase.

271
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,686
I used to be a bodybuilder.

272
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:31,066
Did well domestically, but wasn’t big
enough for internationals.

273
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,527
Then I started a business
and that went okay.

Until my friend borrowed
12 million yen.

275
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,949
I lent it, but he never paid back.

276
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,660
Now I’m an assassin.

277
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,203

I’m seven years your senior.

281

Don’t hold me back.

282
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,056
Best of luck.

283
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,402
We made it.

284
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,865
Is this Fuyumura’s house?

285
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,870
Yes. We already found his address
before we met up with you.

286
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,580
We’re competent.

287
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,541

Oh, wow! You’re so good at your job!

289
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,755
We’ll catch him in a pincer.

290
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,758

and end this team.

291

No guns for me. This is all I need.

292
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,889
No, can’t have you charging ahead.

293
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,476
Well, alright. I guess using a gun

294
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,062
would be more merciful.

295
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,564

You take the front.
We’ll go around back.

298
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,697
Point A is midway
between here and that house.

299
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,576
You two get to Point A,
then enter 30 seconds later.

300
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,703
We’ll use hand signals. Okay?

301
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,206
Okay.

302
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,668
We got it.

00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,980
If it weren’t for us,
you’d be dead by now.

368
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,024
Thank you.

369
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,903
You beat up a thug. So what?

370
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,282
She just crossed the line.

371
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,668
You seem quite fluent in sarcasm.

372
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,673
but you should learn to say
“please” and “thank you” first.

373
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,053
Oh, you wanted a thank you?

374
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,556
Fine. Thank you.

375
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,185
Are all people from Miyazaki like this?

376
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,479
If not, I feel bad for them.

377
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,316
She’s ruining my image
of the good citizens of Miyazaki.

378
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:14,529
Did I ever ask you to come to Miyazaki?

379
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,115
You wanna fix that attitude?

380
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,326
Now, now, now.

381
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:25,039
Let’s all chill out.
How about a quick workout?

382
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,500
Let’s do some squats.

383
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,752
Squats, OK? Settle down.

384
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,426
Ow!

385
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,679
Hey, that hurts!

386
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,852
Okay, it’s torture time!

387
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,064
Work sucks, but torture’s fun.

388
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,068
Yup, let’s have some fun!

389
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,865
We’ll start with your teeth.

390
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,992
Hold on! Wait a second!

391
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,995
You have to ask me questions first!

392
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,329
Fine, I’ll talk!

393
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,165
I’m Tsutomu Hirokawa.

394
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,377
I’m a freelance agent
who gets clients for Fuyumura.

395
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:17,258
He always calls me after each hit,
but he didn’t, so I came to check on him.

396
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:22,513
Today was his 150th...
Matsuura, was it?

397
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,475
He was supposed to call me after that.

398
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,770
He’s still looking for his last target.

399
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,273
I’ll be your bait.

400
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,859
Just please don’t kill me.

401
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,822
He spilled everything.

402
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:48,122
Yeah, but I’ve already got
an appetite for torture.

403
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,376
so can’t we at least rip a nail off?

404
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,462
Appetite? What is this, a curry?

405
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,797
His 150th what?

406
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,594
How come an agent like you is armed?

407
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,055
Well...

408
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,307
He’s...

409
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,644
Kaede Fuyumura’s a monster.

410
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,855
He’ll kill you all!

411
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,902
Like a B-movie villain.

412
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,864
You know, “Let’s get this party started!”

413
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,283
Yeah, it’s either that,

414
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,787
or they talk so quietly
you can’t hear them.

415
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,414
We’ll be quiet.

416
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,587
The guild’s put a hit out
on Fuyumura.

417
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:43,427
Whether we take you out with him
depends on your actions. Understood?

418
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,387
Screw you!

419
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,014
The guild’s rotten.

420
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:47,974
Shut up!

421
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:58,442
We’ll stay the night until Fuyumura
comes back or they find Matsuura.

422
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,111
Sleep in shifts.

423
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,115
Huh?
- Just like camp, right?

424
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,247
Overnight?

425
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,166
Overnight?

426
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,586
Overnight? Here?

427
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,381
You’re joking.

428
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,593
What about the restaurant?

429
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,680
The Miyazaki beef?

430
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,058
The reservation?

431
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,146
This is workplace harassment.

432
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,649
Oh, shit. I’m feeling lightheaded.

433
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,618
Whoa.

434
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,502
“Did nothing today.
Worked out all day.”

435
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,505
Which is it?

436
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,636
Hello?

437
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,641
You want him dead?

438
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,352
Got it.

439
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,201
Murderer!

440
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,620
Somebody help!

441
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,914
I’m in here! Help me!

442
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,332
Murderer!

443
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:53,159
<i>July 2nd. The client had to deliberate</i>
<i>whether or not to kill the target.</i>

444
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,830
<i>This caused the target unnecessary panic.</i>

445
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,292
<i>An imperfect job.</i>

446
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,009
<i>I want out.</i>

447
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,556
<i>August 9th.</i>

448
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,477
<i>A college kid got cancelled</i>
<i>after posting a video</i>

449
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,730
<i>of picking, eating, and throwing away strawberries.</i>

450
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,316
<i>Their parents hired me.</i>

451
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,737
<i>to kill all 150 people involved</i>
<i>in the cancellation.</i>

452
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,240
<i>I couldn’t understand it one bit.</i>

453
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,285
I couldn’t understand but...

454
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,746
He’ll do it.

455
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,791
He says he’s been waiting
for a job like this.

456
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,174
Thank you very much.

457
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,302
Hello.

458
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,186
Excuse me.

459
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,190
Excuse me.

460
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,902
Can I get some chopsticks?

461
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,847
Oh, sorry, we’re closed now.

462
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,186
<i>August 14th.</i>

463
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,564
<i>My first kill with a gun.</i>

464
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,317
<i>The gun smelled like fireworks.</i>

465
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,153
<i>I played with fireworks once as a kid.</i>

466
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,780
<i>Good times.</i>

467
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,630
Ow!

468
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:22,224
<i>I tried to kill the second,</i>
<i>but the gun jammed.</i>

469
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,060
<i>I’d bought faulty bullets.</i>

470
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:40,200
<i>It was a good thing he didn’t fight back.</i>
<i>Otherwise he could’ve killed me.</i>

471
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,787
<i>Lesson learned.</i>

472
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,373
<i>No buying cheap bullets.</i>

473
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,752
<i>December 2nd.</i>

474
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,004
<i>Dinner is stew.</i>

475
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,469
<i>I made it from white cream.</i>

476
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,193
<i>First stew of the year.</i>

477
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,683
<i>That guy was tough.</i>

478
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,687
<i>I thought I was dead.</i>

479
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,107
<i>I’m getting used to guns.</i>

480
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,484
<i>That’s good.</i>

481
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,904
<i>I’ll be at 150 soon.</i>

482
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,658
<i>Can’t wait.</i>

483
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,185
No fair!

484
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,188
What was that?

485
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,941
They’re soggy?

486
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,319
Yum!

487
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,993
But how do we kill ‘em?

488
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,287
You mean Fuyumura?

489
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,705
No.

490
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,374
I mean Minami.

491
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,335
How about poison?

492
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,547
Just forget it.

493
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,009
I bet Iruka had a rough childhood.

494
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,179
You know, with parents and money and such.

495
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,638
Everyone did.

496
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,894
We had to cancel our reservation.

497
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,439
Yeah. You promised and everything.

498
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,108
Promised?

499
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,447
You did. Don’t you remember?

500
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,872
Oh, yeah. I did.

501
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:39,171
You promised we’d go for drinks
after I turned twenty.

502
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,965
I was looking forward to it.

503
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,425
I did, didn’t I?

504
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,304
And that’s why I haven’t been drinking.

505
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,680
Exactly.

506
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,265
No, really.

507
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,477
I didn’t forget.
It just slipped my mind.

508
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,231
How’s that any different?

509
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,693
Remember when I got shot last summer?

510
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,904
My memory’s been hazy since.

511
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,282
Those brothers...

512
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,746
It’s midnight.

513
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,876
“It’s your birthday.”

514
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,837
“Happy birthday.”

515
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,506
AI’s crazy.

516
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,800
But kinda bleak.

517
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,429
Happy birthday!

518
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,767
Thank you.

519
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,811
Thank you, non-AI human.

520
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:40,858
Sorry it’s here.

521
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:46,613
It’s fine. This is fun in its own way.

522
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,032
Good stuff here.

523
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,701
Like what?

524
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,744
Let’s see what we can find.

525
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,376
Look what Fuyumura stashed!

526
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,714
Want one?

527
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,673
No way!

528
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,134
Is that beer?

529
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,761
Yeah. See, look it says “beer”.

530
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,182
They’re so warm!

531
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,685
I mean, yeah.

532
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,271
My first beer’s warm!

533
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,148
I’ve never seen this brand.

534
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,400
Okay, then.

535
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,529
Gotta be cool.
- Cool?

536
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,327
Don’t know.
- It’s already foaming.

537
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,872
Is that it? Whoa, it smells!

538
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:37,998
Okay.

539
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:47,132
Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

540
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,910
This stuff is nasty!

541
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,958
They found Matsuura. Let’s go.

542
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,086
Were you drinking?

543
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,005
I can’t believe you!

544
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,136
Can you keep it down?
People are trying to sleep.

545
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,569
Is this where Matsuura’s hiding?

546
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:54,199
Yes, we infiltrate the hotel,
abduct him and lure out Fuyumura.

547
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,993
No gunfights in a hotel.

548
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,619
Let’s do this!

549
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,579
Hey, what about me?

550
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,791
Answer my calls
in five seconds or die.

551
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,501
Yes, ma’am.

552
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,545
First, pose as guests.

553
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,799
There’s a tailor in the basement.
Wear formal clothes.

554
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,509
Formal?

555
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,365
This is formal.

556
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,076
A formal hotel

557
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,955
Was my walk formal enough?

558
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,832
Very formal.

559
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,125
Thanks.

560
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:50,380
I get one formal point.

561
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,468
No fair! I want formal points, too.

562
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,594
Not on your life.

563
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,637
Those jewels are so sparkly!

564
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,473
Cute with the rope, right?

565
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,101
Hey, cut it out!

566
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,020
Can you take this seriously?

567
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,400
We’re heading to Matsuura’s room.
Remain on standby.

568
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,194
We’ll call if we need you.

569
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,155
So we’re on standby, huh?

570
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,281
Tell us sooner.

571
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,994
Well, the four of us together
would’ve aroused suspicion.

572
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,915
This sure is a fancy hotel.

573
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,752
Peachy keen, Avril Lavigne.

574
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,214
I’d love to stay at a hotel like this.

575
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,508
Not a budget hotel.

576
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,385
But isn’t it nice
when a budget hotel

577
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:41,306
has a breakfast buffet
that’s better than you expected?

578
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,310
Yeah. Or they take their curry seriously.

579
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,686
Exactly.

580
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,856
Miyauchi?
- You scared me!

581
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,191
Why are you here?

582
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,276
Iruka asked me

583
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,446
to look for the target. Matsuura, right?

584
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,366
I was just in Kumamoto,
so it’s on the way.

585
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,409
You were looking for Matsuura?

586
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,203
Just hear me out.

587
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,456
Do you know how much
the cleanup crew has to do?

588
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,167
They practically treat us like gofers.

589
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,255
Hey, kinda like that other guy.

590
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,924
The guy who fidgets with a tape measure.

591
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,219
I can’t remember his name.
They annoying guy.

592
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,178
It’s Tasaka.

593
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,097
You’re so mean.

594
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,390
It’s Iruka!

595
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,644
Is Tasaka your friend?

596
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,479
He’s not my friend.

597
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,023
Guess you could call us cohorts.

598
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,318
Where’s Tasaka now?

599
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,822
He slept six hours
in the past three days,

600
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,533
so now he’s passed out on the toilet.

601
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,785
I’m so glad I’m not on cleanup.

602
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,205
Well, work is work.
We’ve gotta give it our all.

603
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,124
Good attitude.

604
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,001
Oh, you flatter me!

605
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:54,254
Good luck, Iruka!

606
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,048
She’s in Iruka’s good books.

607
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:58,967
Wow.

608
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,305
Must be nice
to have communication skills.

609
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,642
Well, I found Matsuura for you.
It’s all on you now.

610
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,186
Bye!

611
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,689
Thank you.

612
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,402
Don’t look so down.

613
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:22,657
You’d go crazy if you followed
Iruka’s word to the letter.

614
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,618
Shh! She’s listening.

615
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,577
Stop that!

616
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,079
Bzzt!
- The signal!

617
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,627
Look at all the elevators.

618
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,628
Whoa.

619
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,504
Hot Stuff.

620
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,673
What’s that?

621
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,091
Uh, nothing.

622
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,928
Think they have barbecue?

623
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,721
It’d be expensive.

624
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,348
20 thousand yen, at least.

625
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,307
20 thousand...

626
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,852
I guess I can take the hit.

627
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,522
What about our set list tomorrow?

628
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,233
Good question.

629
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,779
Let’s just match
the audience vibes, Sapphire.

630
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,697
I got this, Ruby.

631
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,833
Is it just me, or are
our cover stories kinda vague?

632
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,085
No more “band” angle.

633
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,295
Stop it. You’ll blow out cover.

634
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,588
Okay. Forget it.

635
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,761
I was trying to play along.

636
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,263
It was getting too hard.

637
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,599
Iruka, we found an assassin.

638
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,269
No, not Fuyumura.

639
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,063
He was going to Matsuura’s floor.

640
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,398
Who is he?

641
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,317
How did you catch on?

642
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,486
He walked like he had a gun.

643
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:43,738
How about you?

644
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:44,864
A hunch.

645
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,328
He had a co-op card.

646
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,123
Also...

647
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,085
His name’s Kasamatsu.

648
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:02,299
He’s a member of an agricultural
co-op assassin team.

649
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:03,842
Freelancers.

650
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,510
Called “The Farm”.

651
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,438
Why would they want to kill Matsuura?

652
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,315
Well, I dunno.

653
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,607
Think or die.

654
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,239
Talk or we’ll break your arm.

655
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,788
<i>[MATSUURA: </i>
<i>“Hurry I need my bodyguard.”]</i>

656
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,000
So Matsuura hired Kasamatsu...

657
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,711
That’s him, right?

658
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,340
He hired Kasamatsu as a bodyguard.

659
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:44,841
I see.

660
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,801
This’ll be easy.

661
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:51,848
We’ll pretend to be Kasamatsu
and make contact with Matsuura.

662
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,308
I’ve got this.

663
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,810
I’m a good actor.

664
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,279
I’m Kasamatsu.

665
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,948
Greetings... I mean, hey.

666
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,659
About time.

667
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,039
Hey, you’re bigger than I expected.

668
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:18,458
You look different.

669
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,668
I’ve been working out.

670
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:24,130
Why are you doing that bad-guy talk?

671
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,092
And who’s the chick?

672
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,177
We’re working as a team.

673
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:30,845
I’ll explain later.

674
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,807
Kaede Fuyumura is on his way here.

675
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:35,642
Let’s hurry.

676
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,062
The Farm, was it?

677
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,942
With all these freelance assassins,
this’ll get complicated.

678
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,737
I feel like it won’t end
at killing Fuyumura.

679
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:52,700
But they’re probably all chumps.
We can just cap them.

680
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,454
Actually, the Farm’s
not too special overall,

681
00:56:56,996 --> 00:57:00,750
but they’ve got one really tough guy.

682
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:01,960
Really?

683
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,171
As if Fuyumura wasn’t enough.

684
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,048
Hope we don’t run into him.

685
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,883
Well, actually...

686
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,344
You have.

687
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:12,929
What?

688
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:19,269
Kasamatsu is The Farm’s top assassin.

689
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,020
You’re kidding...

690
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,948
Kasamatsu broke free!
He’s heading your way!

691
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,786
Something wrong?

692
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,956
No everything’s fine.

693
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,459
You’re sure?
- Absolutely.

694
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,054
Hey watch where you’re going!

695
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,475
Wake up.

696
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,853
We’ve got a job to do, Tasaka.

697
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,638
Iruka,

698
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,598
cover me.

699
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,725
Cover you?

700
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:42,894
The name

701
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:44,938
is Riku Nanase.

702
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,650
I’m the guy who’s gonna kick your ass!

703
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:52,255
Ow. Aerobic exercise
is bad for my muscles.

704
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,841
Nanase, I swear to God...

705
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,843
Use your head for once!

706
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,261
I was, I mean it.

707
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,889
Nice work, you guys.

708
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,225
You sure are pros.

709
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,897
So, who’s this guy anyway?

710
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,775
His name’s Kasamatsu.

711
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,153
He was after your life.

712
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,615
Wait, but I thought you were Kasamatsu.

713
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,082
Yeah, we share the same name.
- You do?

714
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,918
We’re the same person.

715
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,670
I see.

716
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:55,568
Out of my way!

717
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,119
Looks like Kasamatsu was acting
as a bodyguard

718
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,622
to hand Matsuura over to Fuyumura.

719
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,707
Fuyumura’s got links to The Farm.

720
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:14,879
So Fuyumura set Kasamatsu up
as a bodyguard. I see.

721
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,881
Yeah, I think I got it!

722
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,135
Wait, Chisato.
Can you explain it to me?

723
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,180
All that matters is that we kill him.

724
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,267
Okay. That makes sense.

725
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,395
What?

726
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,870
You’re that girl.

727
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,506
Open fire!

728
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,467
Take this!

729
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,474
Hop on!

730
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,727
Miyazaki isn’t a war zone!

731
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:43,843
Kaede.

732
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,053
That was rough.

733
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,766
I’ve been worried sick about you.

734
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,561
My lips were sealed.

735
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,693
You told them everything, didn’t you?

736
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:02,236
I heard it all.

737
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:02,820
I heard it all.

738
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,491
You’re kidding, right?

739
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,621
Aren’t we going for barbecue today?

740
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:16,250
Whoa, hold on. Put that down.

741
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,586
Didn’t I buy you barbecue?

742
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,422
I answered your late-night calls.

743
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,716
Screw you!

744
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:28,387
Can’t you see how much mental care
I’ve given you, you murderer?

745
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,936
Ow! You actually shot me!

746
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,789
Fuck!

747
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,800
Fuck!

748
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,009
Fuck!

749
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,144
Hey, look. Zoo.

750
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,107
You’re right. Nice.

751
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,066
I wanna go.

752
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,568
Let’s go.

753
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:29,282
I wonder if they have beef.
Miyazaki beef.

754
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,409
Not beef like that.

755
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,662
Good thing he missed your artery.

756
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,581
We’ve had cases

757
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,625
where we’d have to amputate the limb.

758
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:40,877
But you’re okay.

759
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:42,795
Good.

760
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:45,923
Good for you.

761
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,468
But there’s something I noticed.

762
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:51,971
What?

763
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,019
Strength alone can only do so much.

764
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,314
I’ll switch to killing mode.

765
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:06,796
Murderer.

766
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:18,015
Thank you, thank you.

767
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,899
Fuyumura!

768
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:30,111
What happened to you?

769
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:35,449
Was Kasamatsu any help to you?

770
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,078
He’s our number-one guy, you know.

771
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,371
Where is he now?

772
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,291
He got in the way. He’s dead now.

773
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,168
What?

774
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,547
This is no laughing matter.

775
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,633
I’m not laughing.

776
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:53,634
Come again?

777
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:54,635
So,

778
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,263
I’ve come for a replacement.

779
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,184
I need more allies.

780
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:06,355
Allies I can trust
to flight alongside me.

781
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:10,401
Are you kidding me right now?

782
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,028
This is non-sense.

783
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:16,282
We don’t do half-jobs like you do.

784
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:20,202
We discipline ourselves
to appease the god of harvest.

785
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,873
We all work together
as one big family.

786
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,960
And you talk about replacements?
Getting in the way?

787
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,004
Get real!

788
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:32,673
What?

789
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:34,925
I’m sorry.

790
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,804
I’ve always worked alone,

791
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,266
so I don’t know how this works.

792
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,187
I apologize if I offended you.

793
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:53,235
I thought you were a weirdo,
but you could at least get the job done.

794
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:57,490
Buy now you’ve crossed the line.

795
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,285
You’ve gotta be a man

796
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,455
and pay the piper.

797
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,712
Cut the crap!

798
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:12,880
Oh, come on.

799
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,216
You made the first move.

800
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:18,135
This is self-defense.

801
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,762
Don’t mind me! Kill him!

802
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,306
Avenge the boss!

803
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,651
Wait! Stop!

804
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,763
Please understand.

805
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,641
It’s not my fault.

806
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,813
This goes to show, I’m the strongest!

807
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:15,818
That means you can’t kill me!

808
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,946
Let’s be allies.

809
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,657
No more senseless death.

810
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,200
No wasted lives.

811
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,162
Do you understand?

812
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,247
Do you get it?

813
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:41,510
A gunfight in broad daylight?

814
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:45,598
Clean up’ll be tough.

815
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:50,102
I’m gonna have to do all the work
cause I was on the scene.

816
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:51,437
I said sorry.

817
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,939
You don’t have to listen to him.

818
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,151
We’ll take care of the parking lot.

819
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:58,694
Thanks, Miyauchi.

820
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:00,237
Bye.

821
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,116
For the love of--

822
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,746
Chi-- I mean, Mis. Sugimoto.

823
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:19,506
I may not be in
any position to say this...

824
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,677
You know how when you eat crab,

825
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:27,223
the fork has a spoon on the other end?

826
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,644
One is for small meat,
the other for big meat.

827
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:35,439
I mean, the two
have different purposes,

828
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:37,483
but make one.

829
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:39,568
Get it?

830
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:41,403
What do you mean?

831
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:47,284
You’re the only one
who can comfort Mahiro now.

832
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,454
That’s what he’s saying.

833
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,206
How’d you get it?

834
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,375
Right?

835
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,002
Is that so?

836
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,922
Yeah-- well, basically.

837
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:06,720
Hey.

838
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:07,763
Huh?

839
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,266
What’re you gonna do now?

840
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,937
As you know, I’ve got
assassins coming after me.

841
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,606
So do you have like, a plan?

842
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,235
This is our secret safe house.

843
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,862
We’re coming up with a plan.

844
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,282
Oh, sorry.

845
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,118
Bye.

846
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:32,496
I don’t get paid enough.

847
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,312
How will you get it done
back in Tokyo?

848
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,648
Get what done?

849
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,317
Your hair.

850
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,278
Oh, right. I forgot.

851
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:06,780
I booked an appointment for you.

852
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,574
Sorry.

853
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:10,492
I think...

854
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,290
Puffy might be nice.

855
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,253
Maybe it’s a bit short, though.

856
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,464
What do you think of Mahiro’s hair?

857
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,090
Huh?

858
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,190
Would this work?

859
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:46,403
I think this length might look good on you.

860
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:50,699
I get it, but that’s pretty bold.

861
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,291
So, about earlier...

862
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:02,878
You know...

863
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,218
Thanks for saving me
after I got shot.

864
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:17,851
I know I tend to put people off.

865
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,563
I’m not the best at teamwork.

866
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,400
How do I say it?

867
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,904
I haven’t been a good colleague.

868
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:34,076
I’m sorry I called you decoys.

869
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,703
Did you say that?

870
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,418
To be honest,

871
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,089
you know...

872
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:48,841
Iruka?

873
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:52,344
It’s okay. I should tell them.

874
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:57,850
What happened?

875
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,617
Back in middle school,

876
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:24,251
I idolized Ai Haibara.

877
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,964
Ai Haibara?

878
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:31,425
from “Detective Conan?”

879
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,308
I liked how cool and detached she was.

880
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:45,439
So through all of middle school,
I tried to be sort of

881
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,109
a lone-wolf type.

882
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,530
Soon enough. No friends.

883
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:56,992
I was alone.

884
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,206
But through all that.

885
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:08,670
Ai Haibara was my support,
I couldn’t blame her for it.

886
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:14,343
Anyway,

887
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,932
I was never good with people.

888
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:25,020
I’m still not .

889
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:28,899
I get how you feel.

890
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:37,074
I’m just like you.

891
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:43,539
Mahiro totally loved L
from “Death Note.” Even sat like him.

892
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,249
Don’t tell her that!

893
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,668
She did all his mannerisms, too.

894
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,627
Whatever.

895
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,840
If we’re going to kill Fuyumura,

896
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,845
I need your help.

897
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,515
Please, bear with me.

898
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,524
You did it!

899
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:13,360
Wait, what are you doing?

900
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:17,364
That was adorable!
Your little face was so cute!

901
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:21,702
I don’t get it.
I’m the older one here, remember!

902
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:22,661
Bored now.

903
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:34,047
We were gonna go back
if you brought up “honor” and “pride” again.

904
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,719
But we’re professionals.

905
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,646
This was my 124th kill.

906
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,440
I blew him up.

907
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,026
The key was quantity.

908
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,487
Not 100g or 120g of explosives,
but 110g.

909
01:16:58,363 --> 01:16:59,406
My pistol.

910
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,575
A 9mm. Feels right.

911
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,035
A Jericho?

912
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,704
You know?
- I do. How’d you get it?

913
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,205
Wanna try?
- Can I?

914
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,625
No I couldn’t.

915
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,886
Glad they’re getting along now.

916
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:30,562
Shit!

917
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:39,154
Can I get a gun, too?

918
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:40,405
Not in a million years.

919
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,831
You two form a diversion.

920
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:53,669
We’ll use firepower
to take them out from behind.

921
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,132
Roger.

922
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,321
Something on your mind?

923
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:26,535
What if...

924
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,038
Yeah, we’re definitely gonna kill Fuyumura,

925
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:32,999
but what if...

926
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,670
I mean, you never know, right?

927
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,721
I’ll be waiting on the other side.

928
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:51,143
so can we still hang out there?

929
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,066
Mahiro,

930
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,406
I won’t make that promise.

931
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:09,828
You won’t?

932
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:13,415
I guess not.

933
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,472
Mahiro, look at me.

934
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,192
I expect better of you.

935
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:45,238
Okay.

936
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:51,453
Well, today’s

937
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,916
my twentieth birthday.

938
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:59,628
So I want the priciest
Miyazaki beef in town.

939
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:02,214
You got it.

940
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,386
I’ll spoil you rotten.

941
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,017
Come on.

942
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,062
Roger.

943
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,031
Pass it!

944
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:52,592
Aw, crap. What do I do?

945
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,180
And that’s the intellect of an adult!

946
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:08,793
Thanks.

947
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:14,883
Not cute.

948
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:35,787
Chisato.

949
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:40,666
Ow!

950
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:03,815
Well, there’s your birthday present.

951
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,248
Chisato?

952
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:38,057
Done yet?

953
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:56,451
We’re not done yet, idiot!

954
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,214
You might be the toughest person I’ve ever met.

955
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:12,800
Ranking updated.

956
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,636
You’re #1.

957
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:20,475
You rank people?

958
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:22,852
What a little weirdo.

959
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:25,646
Oh, you don’t?

960
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:28,483
I’ve got my top 150.

961
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:32,528
Who’s your #1?

962
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:35,281
I’m curious.

963
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:39,327
My #1?

964
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,249
I don’t remember the people I’ve killed.

965
01:31:49,795 --> 01:31:51,214
Who was the most fun?

966
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:53,674
The most fun?

967
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:58,554
I’m not sure.

968
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:03,267
but I have had people tell me
they had fun.

969
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,189
Forgot their names.

970
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:14,987
They were a pair of brothers.

971
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:23,663
The younger was a cat lover,
and the older had nasty kicks.

972
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,250
They were tough.

973
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:32,713
Really tough.

974
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,306
I should’ve asked for their names.

975
01:32:58,489 --> 01:32:59,365
What’s your name?

976
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:05,538
Mahiro Fukagawa.

977
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:09,208
Yours?

978
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,670
Kaede Fuyumura.

979
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:33,305
After every kill,

980
01:37:37,726 --> 01:37:38,936
I’d go home.

981
01:37:41,146 --> 01:37:43,023
I’d clean out my microwave.

982
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:47,570
Cut up some fruit.

983
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:52,116
Brush my teeth.

984
01:37:57,329 --> 01:37:59,582
And I’d realise that I’m human.

985
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:07,381
You have

986
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,468
a partner with you.

987
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,807
I’m jealous.

988
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:54,178
Here.

989
01:38:55,262 --> 01:38:56,138
This is yours.

990
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,083
You’re right.

991
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:45,479
Chisato, it’s over.

992
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,248
Don’t do that.

993
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:07,459
Consider that payback.

994
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:15,467
Our job’s finally over.

995
01:40:19,763 --> 01:40:21,098
It’s over.

996
01:40:22,433 --> 01:40:23,308
I’m so happy.

997
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:32,818
Let’s pull it out.

998
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:34,737
Okay.

999
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:38,907
Count of three.

1000
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:41,118
Okay? One, two...

1001
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:44,413
No way.

1002
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:47,708
Yeah, just like that!

1003
01:40:48,083 --> 01:40:49,585
One, two...

1004
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,476
Thanks.

1005
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,311
Let’s go.

1006
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:21,617
Tonight, I’m throwing you
a birthday party.

1007
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:24,161
Yay!

1008
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,915
Can’t wait to be spoiled.

1009
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:29,458
Sure thing.

1010
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:30,626
<i>That reminds me</i>

1011
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:32,878
<i>When’s my birthday?</i>

1012
01:41:34,004 --> 01:41:35,005
Oh, all sorted?

1013
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:38,050
Yeah. All taken care of.

1014
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:40,427
What a relief.

1015
01:41:41,303 --> 01:41:43,013
I thought I was dead.

1016
01:41:43,806 --> 01:41:44,973
So, barbecue tonight?

1017
01:41:45,307 --> 01:41:46,266
How about Kyouchikuen?

1018
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:47,226
Sounds nice.

1019
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:52,022
Well, it’s been wild
these past few days

1020
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:56,610
But in hindsight,
I learned a lot from this experience.

1021
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:05,911
Cheers!

1022
01:42:12,626 --> 01:42:13,877
That hits the spot!

1023
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:18,006
That’s what you gotta say.

1024
01:42:19,174 --> 01:42:20,509
My tongue hurts.

1025
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:24,555
Let me order the meat.

1026
01:42:24,721 --> 01:42:25,889
Thanks.

1027
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:29,434
Chicken nanban?

1028
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:30,769
Yeah, get that.

1029
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:32,646
Oh, and iburigakko.

1030
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:35,649
Iburigakko? What’s that?

1031
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:39,069
You don’t know iburigakko?
Iburigakko’s really good.

1032
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:40,696
Yummy iburigakko.

1033
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:43,198
You just like the word.

1034
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:45,826
Is that a bit?

1035
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:49,288
Aren’t you gonna commit?

1036
01:42:49,371 --> 01:42:53,208
You gotta commit to the bit.
Well, whatever.

1037
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:56,461
I’m 20 now, so I’ll get a handle on that.

1038
01:42:58,839 --> 01:42:59,965
You sure about inviting them?

1039
01:43:01,967 --> 01:43:03,886
I mean, we’re all here anyway.

1040
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:09,558
Welcome.

1041
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:12,060
Ow, ow, ow.

1042
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:16,398
Is the paperwork all done?

1043
01:43:17,065 --> 01:43:17,941
Not at all.

1044
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:25,199
But you’re leaving tomorrow,
so Iruka wanted to spend time with you.

1045
01:43:26,491 --> 01:43:28,243
I never said that.

1046
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:33,081
I just needed a drink, that’s all.

1047
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:35,959
Beer, please.

1048
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,798
Hey there.

1049
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:46,178
Is Tasaka gonna sit here?

1050
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:53,727
Hey.

1051
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,980
Oh. Safe.

1052
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:59,024
What’s safe?

1053
01:44:03,862 --> 01:44:04,613
Excuse me.

1054
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:06,448
Oh, thank you.

1055
01:44:09,117 --> 01:44:09,993
Thanks.

1056
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:28,929
Okay.

1057
01:44:31,848 --> 01:44:35,477
I finished the job,
thanks to you two.

1058
01:44:35,894 --> 01:44:37,062
So, a speech.

1059
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:39,273
From Fukagawa.

1060
01:44:39,606 --> 01:44:40,440
Speech!

1061
01:44:41,233 --> 01:44:43,860
Wait, what?

1062
01:44:44,736 --> 01:44:45,612
Why me?

1063
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:53,203
Cheers!

1064
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:56,873
Cheers!

1065
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,971
Hey, listen.

1066
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:16,268
You know the radio show,
“Dear Girl: Stories”?

1067
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:20,188
You hear the Dorian episode?

1068
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:27,863
You don’t know the Dorian Field?

1069
01:45:27,946 --> 01:45:28,864
I mean it.

1070
01:45:29,448 --> 01:45:31,950
You’ll clean it up way better than me.

1071
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:36,288
She squeezed him into the bucket.
- Yeah, you’re right.

1072
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:37,998
What’s wrong?

1073
01:45:38,081 --> 01:45:39,082
I want some tongue.

1074
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:41,251
Here, let me help.

1075
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,587
Eat as much as you-- Oh, sorry.

1076
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:47,007
There was “Nintama Rantaro”
then “Ojarumaru,”

1077
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:51,678
and “Tensai TV-kun”!
You know?

1078
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:54,639
You know what I mean, right?

1079
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:56,767
You’re not that young.

1080
01:45:57,225 --> 01:46:00,312
What a killer lineup!

1081
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:05,025
Adults aren’t so responsible, huh.

1082
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:07,402
I know.

1083
01:46:09,654 --> 01:46:13,909
You said something about
a mobile battery problem.

1084
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:15,494
What was it?

1085
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:18,622
Oh yeah. That.

1086
01:46:18,872 --> 01:46:19,748
Hold on.

1087
01:46:20,957 --> 01:46:21,875
Just a minute.

1088
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:28,840
But you asked!

1089
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:35,722
Bloodstains.

1090
01:46:57,035 --> 01:47:02,207
Happy birthday, Mahiro!

1091
01:47:05,877 --> 01:47:08,213
Wow, really?

1092
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:13,051
It was really short notice,
and they don’t have a birthday meal here.

1093
01:47:15,345 --> 01:47:17,347
so I went to the pastry shop.

1094
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:19,391
Happy birthday!

1095
01:47:22,185 --> 01:47:23,562
Thank you.

1096
01:47:33,655 --> 01:47:35,073
Thank god you’re alive.

1097
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:46,209
Thank god you’re alive, Chisato.

1098
01:47:51,548 --> 01:47:52,799
Thank god you’re alive.

1099
01:47:59,681 --> 01:48:00,640
Are chopsticks okay?

1100
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:05,604
I’ll start here.

1101
01:48:24,122 --> 01:48:25,582
