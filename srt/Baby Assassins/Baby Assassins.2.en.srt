00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:07,475
Hello.

2
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:09,176
Nice to meet you.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,842
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:13,342
What's your name?

5
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:15,209
My name is Maeno Rina.

6
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:16,542
Miss Rina.

7
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,342
What can I help you with today?

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:21,276
Um.

9
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:28,809
Why does the blue sea turn white when you scoop it up with your hands?

10
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:31,109
That is...

11
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:34,876
That's a little tricky to explain.

12
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:37,276
Because of light from the sun.

13
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,876
Hey! Don't turn the channel, Makoto.

14
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:40,842
Are you listening?

15
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:43,475
Listen very carefully. This is the highlight of my day.

16
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,376
Sorry, sorry.

17
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:47,776
Damn it, I didn’t hear Teacher Shoshinsha's answer.

18
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:50,777
-Why do you care so much？ -Ah! This sucks!

19
00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:51,976
What's the issue?

20
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,843
-You wanted to know why blue water becomes transparent? -Ah, right.

21
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:56,744
That's the reason.

22
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:58,510
Blue is a distant colour?

23
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,141
What's the meaning?

24
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,409
It's a poem.

25
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:03,611
A poem?

26
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:05,008
-You know what I'm talking about？ -What？

27
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:06,743
By who?

28
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:08,243
Hey, answer me!

29
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:09,611
Ok let's go.

30
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:10,842
You got any wet wipes?

31
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:12,275
Aren't they there?

32
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:13,142
No.

33
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:14,276
Nope.

34
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,475
You're so messy. I told you to get a handkerchief!

35
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:17,843
Thanks.

36
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:21,811
Chill out!

37
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:24,743
It's just gonna be a bunch of nobodies!

38
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:27,944
Let's take care of it fast.

39
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:30,576
Ah, so hot.

40
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:36,877
Hot!

41
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:41,375
Mr. Akagi said he'd treat us with barbecue after we finished.

42
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:42,943
-Barbecue? -Yep.

43
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:45,944
Really Hell yeah, that rules.

44
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,243
Nansan Basketball Club gathers

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,777
What we have is...

46
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:52,910
What is it?

47
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:56,409
Have you forotten the slogan of Nansan Middle School Basketball Club?

48
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:58,177
Wow, I've forgotten about that!

49
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:01,176
-Really Ace? -What was the slogan?

50
00:02:01,276 --> 00:02:03,077
We were unstoppable then.

51
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:06,276
-Do you remember? -Hold on, hold on.

52
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,343
What we have is...

53
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:09,777
Courage.

54
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,242
We are...

55
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:14,177
-Strong men -Hey!

56
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:15,712
Could you please take this seriously?

57
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:16,943
Be quiet.

58
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,910
Where is everyone?

59
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:26,744
Ding dong, Ding dong.

60
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,309
Ah, here it is.

61
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:39,978
Eh?

62
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:46,043
Just a second.

63
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:49,911
Uh, didn't you say they were nobodies?

64
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,077
Yeah.

65
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:53,943
Was the contact wrong? Sometimes that happens?

66
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:54,944
That can't be it, can it?

67
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,309
Hey the fuck you guys doing?

68
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:02,477
Hey, why is this different than in the email?

69
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:04,912
-Hey. -What did you say?

70
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,243
Hey!

71
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:07,343
Why the fuck you here?

72
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:10,712
I don't get mahjong. Is mahjong fun?

73
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:12,376
What?

74
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:13,644
Mahjong?

75
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:14,678
Uh...

76
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:18,343
I stopped watching Gambling Apocalypse at the Mahjong chapter.

77
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:21,444
So what?

78
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:23,577
You should fuck off.

79
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:27,612
We doing this?

80
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,677
We're gonna fight?

81
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,277
Fight!

82
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,110
-Fuck em up! -Yeah!

83
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:33,979
Take this bastard!

84
00:03:35,777 --> 00:03:36,577
Go to hell!

85
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:44,712
Hey!

86
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,310
You bastards!

87
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:22,411
Oh!

88
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,043
My gun jammed!

89
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:37,578
Ah it burns!

90
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:10,513
Get out!

91
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:38,845
His feet!

92
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,479
Hold his feet!

93
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,678
I can't shoot!

94
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,479
Oh that scared me.

95
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:02,445
-Shit -You good？

96
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:04,212
Is he dead?

97
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,946
Yeah, he's dead.

98
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:08,411
That was close.

99
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,646
Ah it hurts!

100
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,879
It really hurts, that bald fucker.

101
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:14,979
I want a bandaid.

102
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:16,513
Can I get a bandaid?

103
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:18,312
I got something.

104
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,445
Nice give me some!

105
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,580
Oh that's good!

106
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,579
You deserve a treat.

107
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:30,614
Victory dinner!

108
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:32,779
Barbecue

109
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:35,479
Barbecue Barbecue!

110
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:39,079
-Eating barbecue everyday! -That's the life!

111
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:40,514
What to say...

112
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:43,311
We got the wrong information from the contact.

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,246
They put the blame on us.

114
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:48,780
anyway…

115
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,947
Well done, Mr. Akagi.

116
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:59,246
We risk our lives for this job. But corpse disposal...

117
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:04,747
management, negotiation and other intermediary work are all left to you.

118
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:08,445
But something like "there's no reward for killing the wrong person" happened.

119
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:09,613
Yeah.

120
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,747
I thought I could get that high end "Xu Xuyuan" Pork.

121
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:13,245
I'm very sorry.

122
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:14,211
I'll give you my share.

123
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:16,580
Agh!

124
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:17,780
Excuse me.

125
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
We spilled some tea.

126
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:21,179
Are you alright?

127
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,746
Are you hurt?

128
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,246
It's fine.

129
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:29,112
Please enjoy

130
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:30,013
Thanks.

131
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:34,914
What were you saying?

132
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,579
Well

133
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,947
I'm really sorry about this Yuri, Makoto.

134
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:46,747
It's really hard for us to appeal cases like these.

135
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:51,946
Joining an Assassins association is another thing.

136
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,380
In other words we...

137
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:57,580
Are treated as wage slaves.

138
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,814
Why not work part time?

139
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,515
We all do the same job right? Killing?

140
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:02,913
Yeah, what's the difference?

141
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:05,247
I agree.

142
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,581
Even though I agree.

143
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,847
But this is how reality is.

144
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,045
I didn't used to be like this.

145
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:18,848
What kind of life is this?

146
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,079
It's awful.

147
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:25,980
You've always taken care of us, that's all I wanted to say.

148
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,413
It turns out you were tricked right?

149
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:33,714
Mr. Akagi.

150
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,515
We want to go to the next level.

151
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,213
I don't just wanna be a delivery boy my whole life.

152
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:44,980
What I'm going to say, they're just rumors.

153
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:49,581
I heard there are more and more wage slaves like you.

154
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,548
But there are very few full time assassins.

155
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,147
Yeah, so?

156
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:58,514
There seems to be a full time assassin in Taito Ward.

157
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,780
The quality is different from that of the wage slaves.

158
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,982
Well, then what?

159
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,312
If you kill them, the position will be open.

160
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:12,280
You've been doing this for so long.

161
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:15,246
If you can join the organization you can move up.

162
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:19,147
But the people in the association can not find out.

163
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:23,648
You must assassinate the assassin. To go full time.

164
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:26,914
Wow, that's way too risky, right?

165
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:31,915
I've never gone against an assassin, it's definitely dangerous.

166
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:32,981
Right, brother?

167
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,146
-Fuck em up. -I knew you'd say that.

168
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,648
Fuck em up, Fuck em up.

169
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:38,780
Knock em down

170
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,748
Well then... Mr. Akagi.

171
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,516
You risk your life to fight for us, and we will risk our lives to accompany you.

172
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:47,948
Fight for victory.

173
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:48,982
Hell yeah.

174
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:50,481
I see.

175
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,480
I also have this plan.

176
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:54,948
You have to work hard, and seize the opportunity.

177
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:56,616
Very good.

178
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,280
Oh, I have pictures of them.

179
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,448
What kind of guys are they?

180
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:01,448
Uh...

181
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:03,080
C'mon! Show us.

182
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:04,815
It's these two.

This...

191
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:45,482
What is this?

192
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,549
(Bill of 3,890,800 yen)

193
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,682
Ten hundred thousand...

194
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:56,683
3.89 Million...

195
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:02,082
What!?

196
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:07,782
Miss Fukugawa

197
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:12,582
Fukugawa.

198
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:14,182
Mahiro?

199
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:20,717
Huh?

200
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,248
What's wrong?

201
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:24,816
It seems,

202
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:27,149
Gym.

203
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,114
Gym?

204
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,381
Didn't we join a gym in high school?

205
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:36,716
Gym

206
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:37,949
Did we?

207
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,749
Yeah in Ueno, we only went once.

208
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:44,315
Ahhhhh

209
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,083
Gym in Okachimachi

210
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:48,582
People from the association also go there.

211
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,049
But after working out

212
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,983
We slipped into Dessert Heaven and got fat.

213
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:54,849
That's right.

214
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:56,215
Yes, yes.

215
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:57,850
Work out for free.

216
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,883
Ah Dessert Heaven, I haven't been there in a while

217
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:02,482
-Right? -Want to go again?

218
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,250
-Yeah I really want to go. -Yeah.

219
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:06,617
The pasta there is so good.

220
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,216
Surprising the pasta is the best thing.

221
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:11,448
-Raw spaghetti -Yeah.

222
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,148
-It tastes like pappardelle -That's right

223
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:15,651
And ice cream for free.

224
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,949
-Häagen-Dazs for free. -Häagen-Dazs.

225
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,015
Excellent

226
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,250
So, so.

227
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,682
That was five years ago right?

228
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:24,349
Are you talking about the pasta?

229
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:25,850
Gym.

230
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,116
I am talking about the Gym.

231
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:29,682
Yes, sorry.

232
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,216
It seems we signed a contract.

233
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:33,851
But pasta every month.

234
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,116
But there are dues every month.

235
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,350
Now they've sent a reminder.

236
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:41,782
For us two combined it's...

237
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,083
3.89 Million.

238
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,751
What? What? What?

239
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:58,949
3.89 Million...?

240
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,416
That's too expensive.

241
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:05,949
Plus late payment fees and other penalties.

242
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,718
Good morning.

243
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:23,717
Good morning.

244
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,617
Eh... Mr. Susano.

245
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,784
Did you read the email?

246
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,383
Is there something like a trial period?

247
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:33,651
-I'm asking you to fight for one. -It's annoying.

248
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:34,784
Not possible

249
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:36,517
Huh?

250
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,784
Gyms don't have a trial period.

251
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:41,683
And it sent over 20 reminder letters.

252
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:44,651
You ignored them so it's on you.

253
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:47,217
But we only went once.

254
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:48,315
It turns out.

255
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,150
You expect us to pay membership dues for four years?

256
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,985
So

257
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:55,884
They sent bills every month

258
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,784
It's your fault you threw them away.

259
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:01,283
Misato, call the customer complaint line

260
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,316
I'll do it

261
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:03,885
Don't do that.

262
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:05,484
And

263
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:08,518
Our association has Happy Assassin Insurance.

264
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:10,317
The two of you should join

265
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,351
What is Happy Assassin Insurance

266
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,283
If the insured person is over 18, it'll change automatically

267
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,251
From normal insurance.

268
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:23,384
To Happy Assassin Insurance

269
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,450
The change over procedure hasn't finished.

270
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:28,852
You still have 2 years of insurance premiums outstanding.

271
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,416
What is he talking about?

272
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,718
Very scary.

273
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,217
All in insurance and gym fees.

274
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:37,483
Please pay it off by 3pm this friday.

275
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,117
Ah, so annoying.

276
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:44,483
My savings get smaller everyday.

277
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:48,083
I recently spent 500,000 on driving lessons.

278
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,618
That's because you failed so many times.

279
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:50,918
Yeah yeah.

280
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,719
Your savings are all going negative.

281
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,450
Friday by 3pm.

282
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,217
Please go to the bank and pay over the counter.

283
00:15:58,585 --> 00:15:59,519
I know.

284
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:01,416
Go directly to the bank window.

285
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,284
You have to go to the assigned bank to pay.

286
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:05,552
Yeah I know.

287
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:07,518
You only have to tell me once.

288
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:10,451
We'll pay it properly.

289
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:23,585
Ah, so hot.

290
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:24,985
So sore.

291
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,417
I need to catch my breath.

292
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,351
Can't we just walk instead?

293
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:30,851
Isn't this a awesome way to run?

294
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,218
Sorry.

295
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:52,852
Very good.

296
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:07,684
Excuse me.

297
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:11,553
Looks like they still haven't caught those serial bank robbers.

298
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:12,818
No good.

299
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:28,852
It's done.

300
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,318
It looks delicious.

301
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:37,918
So sleepy.

302
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,251
So so sleepy.

303
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:43,084
Yeah, delicious.

304
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,318
Gross.

305
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,084
I knew it'd be like this.

306
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:52,919
I knew it.

307
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,253
What?

308
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:58,452
Tasty.

309
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,753
Yeah.

310
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:03,417
People...

311
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,253
Come basically in two types.

312
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:10,185
Which are?

313
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,986
People who show others their tongues,

314
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:16,151
And those who don't show anyone their tongues.

315
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,853
I am totally someone who shows my tongue.

316
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,719
Tongue.

317
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:23,385
The kind who shows off to others.

318
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:25,253
Uh...

319
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:26,619
Eh...

320
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,952
When the supermarket has rice balls on sale for 100 Yen?

321
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:35,086
Um...

322
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:37,052
At this time,

323
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:40,118
That kind of person would definitely get a sausage rice ball.

324
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,386
A silly looking ball filled with mayonnaise.

325
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:43,253
Are you making fun of me?

326
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:45,051
Nope.

327
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:46,452
But it is true.

328
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,318
When supermarket rice balls were on sale.

329
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:53,385
I saw someone buying salt rice balls.

330
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,253
It really freaked me out when I saw it.

331
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,720
Do they not care about special offers?

332
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:00,253
Cause salt rice balls are always 100 Yen.

333
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,285
It's hard to come across a sale.

334
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,853
But they wasted the discount.

335
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:08,018
It's true, I feel numb to life.

336
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:09,553
People who are indifferent to anything,

337
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,720
Ah.

338
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,085
This kind of person is truly calm at heart.

339
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:16,686
Is a real rich man.

340
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,019
That kind of person has to be mentally ill, right?

341
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:20,886
You call someone crazy, just cause of a rice ball?

342
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,653
The insurance premium is due today, did you pay it?

343
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:30,821
Huh? Weren't you gonna do that?

344
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:34,086
Eh?

345
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:35,987
Eh?

346
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:41,219
-Ehhh!? -Ehhh!?

347
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:44,986
Only 30 minutes left?

348
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,319
It sucks I have to eat so fast.

349
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,354
I'm still in the mood to eat now.

350
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,152
Can you please stop hitting me on the head?

351
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:55,787
Sorry.

352
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:57,485
But the ice is melting.

353
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,352
Faster faster.

354
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,319
What's up...?

355
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:08,853
What's up?

356
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:11,219
The next door neighbour is coming back.

357
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:12,988
So?

358
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,354
We'd meet our neighbours like this.

359
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:15,586
It doesn't matter.

360
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,186
No, no, no, no.

361
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:19,320
That would be so embarassing.

362
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:22,686
We met yesterday too. It'd be weird to meet two days in a row.

363
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,320
He'll think I planned it.

364
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:28,786
He might think I'm a stalker.

365
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,187
No one would think that?

366
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:32,454
Hush, quiet!

367
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:34,019
He heard.

368
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:36,287
So difficult.

369
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:39,820
Neighbours, go away.

370
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:50,820
The neighbours gone now, yeah?

371
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,954
I think it's time to go.

372
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,920
Just to be safe, better use a smoke grenade.

373
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:01,788
That's enough. Let's go.

374
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:07,555
Shit.

375
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:10,821
Wait, what are you doing?

376
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,254
-Ah! -Quick! Fan!

377
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,320
It's your fault for pulling the pin.

378
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:28,888
Hungry.

379
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:30,087
Faster

380
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:30,420
C'mon c'mon.

381
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,287
Hurry up.

382
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,186
I think I forgot to lock the door.

383
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:35,120
Really.

384
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:36,420
Quick!

385
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:41,721
We made it!

386
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:59,153
Crab speed.

387
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:13,320
No. 45

388
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,722
We want to pay.

389
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:21,954
You want to pay right?

390
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:23,487
These.

391
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:25,420
I see.

392
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,354
Good job, you caught up.

393
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:38,890
This isn't difficult at all.

394
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:42,454
I can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

395
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:45,988
Hello.

396
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:49,822
This is a robbery!

397
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:51,421
Hands up!

398
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,255
No way.

399
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:01,021
Put the money in here!

400
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:02,154
Now!

401
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:19,756
Why did you choose this time?

402
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:22,120
We're in a hurry.

403
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,588
Hurry up and grab it.

404
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,154
Faster.

405
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,455
How long are you gonna delay?

406
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:28,954
Sorry.

407
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:30,788
I can't remember the password.

408
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:32,088
Uh.

409
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:33,923
Ex-girlfriend's...

410
00:23:34,254 --> 00:23:36,188
Is it my ex-girlfriend's birthday?

411
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:39,956
Hey, cheer me up.

412
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:41,387
Sorry.

413
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:42,655
Come one grandpa.

414
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:43,956
Come on.

415
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,823
Calm down.

416
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:48,388
Huh?

417
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:52,155
If you're later than 3pm there will be a 30% late fee.

418
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,254
Is that true?

419
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:54,922
It's obviously an underground bank.

420
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:56,122
The rip off went too far.

421
00:23:57,256 --> 00:24:00,221
How much is the monthly payment of 4 million for 4 years? I get angrier the more i think about it.

422
00:24:00,488 --> 00:24:01,589
I feel that way every time they tell me,

423
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:05,722
"Of course because you're a killer you have to pay more."

424
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,890
This is obviously some excuse.

425
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:12,121
They often say this is a "killer" price.

426
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:13,021
I get angry when I hear it.

427
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,222
The fire burns strong.

428
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,089
Hey!

429
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,256
You guys are talking too much.

430
00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:17,354
Bitch.

431
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:18,556
Bitch

432
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:20,956
Big bitch.

433
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,221
Hey.

434
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:24,789
You looking to die?

435
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:26,322
-What? -No, no,no.

436
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:29,121
We support you.

437
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:30,955
Please hurry up and finish.

438
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:31,956
The fuck you talking about?

439
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:36,556
Don't shoot suddenly, moron.

440
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,122
It's cause this guy's too damn slow.

441
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,688
quit screwing around and help me.

442
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:43,723
I am not screwing around!

443
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,557
I'll monitor you and you carry it.

444
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:47,221
Lets agree on splitting the work like this.

445
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,321
Don't break formation.

446
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,456
What formation. It's just two people.

447
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:54,723
By the way, you just bought heated cigarettes, yeah?

448
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:56,557
What are you on about?

449
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:57,657
Hey.

450
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,556
If you wanna rob, you gotta be smarter, right?

451
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:06,823
Of course.

452
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:09,189
No killing outside of work.

453
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:10,824
Insurance won't pay out for that.

454
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:12,823
The association won't support you either.

455
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:14,657
No harm, no gain.

456
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:18,221
Not without benefit, this can help others.

457
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:19,189
Yeah.

458
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:21,356
There is a reason for this provision.

459
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:22,557
For example

460
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,455
It's impossible to take the case secretly without going through the association.

461
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:27,724
Taking the case secretly?

462
00:25:27,724 --> 00:25:30,455
Doesn't every killer operate in secret?

463
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:32,957
That's right

464
00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:33,991
In short,

465
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:37,022
Like that previous maid cafe incident that turned into a protest,

466
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:39,122
And never take action to kill people.

467
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,255
The worst case scenario is you get suspended.

468
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:44,356
I know.

469
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:46,190
Are you okay?

470
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:52,357
I thought there were no mosquitoes any more.

471
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:53,923
Very good.

472
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:02,489
Can I tell you what I'm thinking?

473
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:04,423
Let me guess.

474
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:05,656
Um.

475
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:08,322
Are you thinking about how to take em out?

476
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,490
Bingo.

477
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:11,923
You really get me.

478
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:14,590
We've been together for years.

479
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,858
I'll be suspended next time.

480
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:20,089
Let's talk about it then.

481
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:29,725
Power.

482
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:31,824
Good.

483
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,122
Do your job.

484
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:37,256
Eh?

485
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:38,456
Everyone,

486
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,490
facing that way

487
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:42,756
close your eyes.

488
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:44,924
Got it?

489
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:46,791
Yes.

490
00:26:49,322 --> 00:26:50,256
You can't kill them.

491
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,591
Each other.

492
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:52,791
What are you doing?

493
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:54,222
That enough!

494
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,457
If we catch these two we can sell them for money.

495
00:26:59,191 --> 00:26:59,958
Right?

496
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:00,890
Just do it.

497
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,591
Finish in one minute.

498
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:06,289
OK

499
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:21,825
What is it? Dammit.

500
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,157
Hey, they're not ordinary people.

501
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:26,190
Who are they?

502
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:27,490
Hello?

503
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,526
Dammit! Where did you go?

504
00:27:29,992 --> 00:27:31,122
Hey, where are you going!?

505
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:32,390
Formation B, right?

506
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:34,024
-That's it. -OK

507
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:39,825
Damn little hairy head.

508
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:42,258
I know where you're hiding.

509
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:44,123
I'll kill everyone here, I won't show mercy!

510
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:10,658
Horrible.

511
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:38,725
Sorry.

512
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,992
Sorry.

513
00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:08,123
Ah, they counter sister.

514
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:10,358
I want to pay.

515
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,993
We have to pay by 3pm.

516
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:14,625
Police... Call the police...

517
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:18,259
Of course we'll call the police but we're in a hurry.

518
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,725
Can I bother you?

519
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:23,125
Call the please, please don't kill me.

520
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:24,627
Listen,

521
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:28,124
We'll be in trouble if we don't transfer the money quickly.

522
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,425
Mahiro please calm down.

523
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,659
You have to be calm or you'll scare everyone.

524
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:35,792
Let me demonstrate it to you once more.

525
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,057
Excuse me,

526
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:41,759
I know you're scared, but we're in a hurry,

527
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,158
Can I trouble you?

528
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:46,057
Is this more terrifying?

529
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:47,325
Ah really.

530
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:48,893
That

531
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:52,759
I want to send money. Please handle it as soon as possible. Do you understand?

532
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,627
Do you understand?

533
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,191
Do you understand?

534
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:58,057
Answer quick.

535
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,925
Call the police quickly.

536
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:04,124
Accept your fate, robber!

537
00:30:04,358 --> 00:30:05,993
Robber? I'm not a robber!

538
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:10,726
We're not!

539
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:13,092
That's enough, hurry up.

540
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:14,358
We are not.

541
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,458
Suspension.

542
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,727
Keep in touch during suspension.

543
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,324
Please read the seven assassin rules in the handbook during your suspension.

544
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:23,893
There are exceptions written above.

545
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,091
Exceptions?

546
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,492
Being directly named and entrusted by someone from the association, etc.

547
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:32,559
First of all it's impossible.

548
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:38,892
Are you so heartless? Mr. Susano?

549
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:43,960
We haven't paid our insurance premiums and we're still in debt.

550
00:30:43,994 --> 00:30:48,225
Yes, we are obviously killing people for the sake of the association.

551
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,425
Too much.

552
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:54,660
It would be great if Mr. Tasaka could secretly help with this matter.

553
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,391
He's quite slow in this regard.

554
00:30:58,058 --> 00:30:59,459
I'm Tasaka. Got something to say?

555
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:02,859
-Thank you for your hard work. Good morning. -Good morning.

556
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,025
I'm in the palace. Hello you two.

557
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:07,493
-Hello. -You should

558
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,425
Are you not interested in our processing work?

559
00:31:10,425 --> 00:31:14,393
Our relationship with the police is already very delicate.

560
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:18,126
It’s a yellow light when reporting, and a red light when the police arrive.

561
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,826
Your explanation is too long. No wonder you are disliked.

562
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:23,527
Can you shut up first?

563
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:25,493
You're saying I'm hated?

564
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:28,325
Anyways please let these two work temporarily to survive.

565
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:30,359
No salary will be paid of the end of this month.

566
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:31,894
Can't waste it.

567
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,158
What? Tomorrow.

568
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:40,192
I was gonna go to Asakusa Miku to eat sukiyaki like crazy.

569
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:44,260
I'm going to participate in the competition of Sanqiao Dessert Shop tomorrow.

570
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:46,593
What about Tanesen's plan to eat while walking

571
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:48,326
You just want to eat.

572
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:52,092
There seems to be a shaved ice shop with a long queue in Yanaka Ginza.

573
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:53,593
That's called the Secret Hall, right?

574
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,961
My ex-girlfriend and I have been there.

575
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,259
Have you been there?

576
00:31:57,726 --> 00:31:58,760
What do you think?

577
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:00,159
What should I say?

578
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:03,859
Both gentle and cute.

579
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:06,960
She likes spicy food, so we often go to Mikawa Island...

580
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,226
I'm not asking about your ex-girlfriend.

581
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,325
Huh?

582
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:12,960
Tasaka please turn off mute temporarily.

583
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,060
Right.

584
00:32:14,794 --> 00:32:16,325
Let's go on strike.

585
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:19,628
Yeah, let's strike.

586
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:20,528
Strike.

587
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:22,560
- Let's organize it. - Please read the "Three Articles of the Killer's Agreement"

588
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:25,594
The second item inside reads "No strikes"

589
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:32,227
How about we start our own business?

590
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:35,425
Yeah, set up Assassin Ventures.

591
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:36,460
Be independent.

592
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,194
-Leave this place where your hands and feet are tied. -Be independent.

593
00:32:38,194 --> 00:32:40,593
To comply with labor regulations...

594
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,225
Stop talking about labor laws, okay? Giving me a headache.

595
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,426
Just like the lame rules of school.

596
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,325
if you post this on twitter, there'll be trouble.

597
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,193
Indeed.

598
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,325
-That's great! -Yeah

599
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,193
Please stop.

600
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:05,360
Non-stop killing,

601
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,127
And still broke.

602
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:13,594
All I can see is my empty hands.

603
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:19,694
Terrible.

604
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:23,493
(Kogane Canteen)

605
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:25,661
Every time I come to a Teishoku restaurant, I think about it.

606
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:32,529
Set meals are priced at 700, 800, 900, and 1,000 yen.

607
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,393
What?

608
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:39,227
Chicken cutlet meal for 680 Yen.

609
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:41,828
Pork and ginger set for 780 Yen.

610
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,894
Teriyaki sea bream & fried horse mackerel set for 880 Yen.

611
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:49,694
And a 1,000 Yen yakiniku meal.

612
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,126
Like a capitalistic pyramid.

613
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:56,060
I hope soon we can have the BBQ set with our own money.

614
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,695
You can't take your eyes off her.

615
00:33:58,994 --> 00:33:59,794
Huh?

616
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:01,027
Did she notice?

617
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:02,562
Did she notice?

618
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:05,126
I'm too lazy to pay attention to you, but you're clearly staring at her.

619
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,227
Because she stands out in a place like this.

620
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:10,827
Is she a migrant worker?

621
00:34:11,794 --> 00:34:12,861
She must have a good personality.

622
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:14,896
Go and talk to her.

623
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:16,193
-Huh? -Do it.

624
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,261
No. no, no, no.

625
00:34:18,928 --> 00:34:19,829
That'd be weird.

626
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:21,195
She'd be creeped out.

627
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:22,594
-You're so damn loud. -Sorry.

628
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:25,327
Well you're into her, right?

629
00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:29,193
Yeah but I don't know how to just strike up a conversation.

630
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:30,294
Ah!

631
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,194
Let's just say I saw the store on Facebook,

632
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:34,028
Then change the topic to her.

633
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:36,661
That'd be very creepy.

634
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:38,194
Huh?

635
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:39,729
Eh? Eh?

636
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,093
More tea?

637
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,194
Ahhh.

638
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:47,995
The cup is here.

639
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,060
Thank you.

640
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:02,629
Thank you Miss Sakura.

641
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:03,795
Huh?

642
00:35:04,262 --> 00:35:07,394
Ah, I saw it,

643
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:10,128
This store's Facebook.

644
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:11,961
Then I saw your information.

645
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,562
Ah thank you.

646
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:16,628
I'm not spying on you.

647
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:20,562
Thank you.

648
00:35:23,094 --> 00:35:23,895
Perfect.

649
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:25,595
-She has a crush on me. -She's scared, right?

650
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:27,228
Eh?

651
00:35:27,897 --> 00:35:28,696
Eh?

652
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:30,929
Welcome.

653
00:35:31,227 --> 00:35:32,729
-It's so hot. -Hello, Mr. Akagi.

654
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:34,128
What happened?

655
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:37,294
-So thirsty. -She poured that tea for me.

656
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:40,428
Those two people,

657
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,896
Took out those bank robbers and are currently suspended.

658
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:45,128
-Huh? -Really?

659
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:47,294
Hurry up.

660
00:35:47,794 --> 00:35:49,361
Let's go.

661
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:51,863
This is a robbery!

662
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,194
No way.

663
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:07,562
Wow.

664
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,629
Cool.

665
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,663
Thanks for the hospitality.

666
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:17,194
Thanks for the hospitality.

667
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:18,729
You're too shy.

668
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:21,730
I'm not shy.

669
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:24,662
What? Is Makoto obsessed with that clerk?

670
00:36:25,128 --> 00:36:25,896
Hooked?

671
00:36:25,962 --> 00:36:28,329
-Obsessed. -Obsessed.

672
00:36:28,696 --> 00:36:31,228
What? Shut up.

673
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:33,228
You need to quit smoking first.

674
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,696
Impossible, what is this?

675
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,829
This is what she gave me when we checked out.

676
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,963
Huh? Was it specifically for me?

677
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:40,963
Makoto, what should I say?

678
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:43,161
Yes, for you.

679
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:45,897
-Really? Awesome. -Congratulations.

680
00:36:46,229 --> 00:36:47,829
I received a gift from Miss Sakura.

681
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:51,162
What should I do if I don’t like sweets? I can’t throw it out?

682
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,363
I will cherish it.

683
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:55,428
I must get her something, in return.

684
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:58,296
If you become an assassin, date her.

685
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,862
Ah.

686
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:02,195
The sooner you become an assassin, the better.

687
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,329
Okay let's fight right away.

688
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,196
Oh.

689
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:07,495
It's good to be young.

690
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:09,462
When I was a student,

691
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:11,363
I went skiing with girls.

692
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,696
I don't ski, so I can't relate.

693
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:14,596
What was the era?

694
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:36,596
Why is it so hot?

695
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:38,462
No way.

696
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,898
The wages here are high and you don't have to talk to customers.

697
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:42,328
I'm cooperating with you.

698
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,963
Mr. Rengoku's enemy.

699
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:47,463
Oops, what's going on?

700
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:48,328
What? What?

701
00:37:48,762 --> 00:37:50,263
Kid.

702
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,564
Kid, I didn't do anything to Mr. Rengoku.

703
00:37:52,697 --> 00:37:53,631
Don't kick me, okay?

704
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:54,962
Crossing the limits!

705
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:56,763
Wah!

706
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:57,697
Crossing the limit...?

707
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:00,097
Ah, it gets messy,

708
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:00,996
Again.

709
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,395
If you don't stop now, I'll kick you to death.

710
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:05,264
I'm going to complain to your mother.

711
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:07,930
-Is the grand prize really in there? -It's in there.

712
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:09,997
-I don't believe it. -Please don't do this.

713
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:11,230
Okay, this is for you.

714
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:13,563
Just this? Too bad.

715
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,631
Okay, okay.

716
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:17,731
Hey what are you doing!?

717
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,630
Hey! Hey!

718
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,897
Ah, don't fight.

719
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:23,430
I just want another prize!

720
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:25,295
This shitty panda!

721
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:26,630
Hey!

722
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:31,897
Please next person.

723
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:35,030
Welcome to the shiny Tachibana Shopping Street!

724
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:36,930
Hello everyone!

725
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:39,062
Hello everyone!

726
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:42,230
Do you want to challenge the lottery?

727
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:44,029
5、6、7、8

728
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:47,030
Draw lots, draw lots, draw lots, draw lots.

729
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,796
Win the jackpot! Everyone gets a prize!

730
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,764
Draw lots, draw lots, draw lots, draw lots.

731
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,062
Hey.

732
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:56,664
Take a break.

733
00:38:56,864 --> 00:38:58,496
-Okay. -Thank you.

734
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:01,997
-Take this -I'm thirsty.

735
00:39:09,998 --> 00:39:10,931
This tastes really good.

736
00:39:11,197 --> 00:39:12,464
Sore to the core.

737
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:15,096
Did you make this yourself? It's so good.

738
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:17,565
Are you students?

739
00:39:17,798 --> 00:39:18,565
We are, working people.

740
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:21,229
You have a lot to do.

741
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:23,532
Yes, life has just began.

742
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,963
So you've seen that one?

743
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:30,297
"I Fell in Love Like a Flower Bouquet" by Yuji Sakamoto.

744
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:33,864
Ah, that movie was pretty talked about.

745
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:36,164
We don't watch romance films very often.

746
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:37,229
Yeah.

747
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:39,329
Gee, that movie was great.

748
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:44,296
If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.

749
00:39:44,664 --> 00:39:47,832
Grandpa's words sound like a hopeless college student.

750
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:51,931
I finally bought "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild".

751
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:57,297
Sugata Masaki said, "Playing Puzzle and Dragon is the most exciting thing."

752
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:00,464
That scene was awesome.

753
00:40:01,797 --> 00:40:03,297
What kind of movie is that?

754
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:05,330
And that one where,

755
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:07,664
Kasumi Arimura and Masaki Sugata,

756
00:40:07,964 --> 00:40:10,430
They are all wearing Converse’s classic shoes with an open smile.

757
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:11,532
Right.

758
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:12,999
I was so moved,

759
00:40:13,697 --> 00:40:15,330
I bought the same shoes.

760
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,297
Ah amazing.

761
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,197
Amazing.

762
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:18,398
Just open your mouth and smile.

763
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:21,163
and

764
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:23,765
and he's in "Drowning Love"

765
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:25,931
Isn't he so handsome?

766
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:28,932
Crazy handsome?

767
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:32,396
Also, this is what he wore during the Red and White Singing Contest.

768
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,097
So handsome.

769
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:36,965
Maison Margiela sweater.

770
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:38,664
Maison Margiela?

771
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,765
Really so handsome.

772
00:40:41,298 --> 00:40:43,898
At first glance, he is so handsome that he is so handsome.

773
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,264
It turned out to be Maison Margiela.

774
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:46,297
Of course he's so handsome.

775
00:40:46,464 --> 00:40:48,398
-Sugata, he's... -so handsome.

776
00:40:48,465 --> 00:40:50,631
-Sugata... -So handsome.

777
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:51,899
Sugata...

778
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:53,698
3、4…

779
00:40:55,398 --> 00:40:56,364
So tired.

780
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:00,465
So hard working but so little money.

781
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:03,364
Can't these pieces be turned into 10,000-yen bills?

782
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:06,900
We'd make a hundred times this if we killed just one person.

783
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,264
Don't even think about it.

784
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:10,865
Cherish this 8,000 yen.

785
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:13,799
Live a wonderful little lucky life.

786
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:18,533
What is his name?

787
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,063
That lazy...

788
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:21,732
-Mr. Matsushita - Is it Mr. Matsumoto?

789
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,031
I always feel like he...

790
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:25,933
He have always said that Masaki Sugata is so handsome.

791
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:27,932
What a weirdo.

792
00:41:28,231 --> 00:41:30,098
just like Maison Margiela.

793
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:31,866
So handsome.

794
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:34,665
Ah I surrender.

795
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,998
Tei wins again.

796
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:42,198
Five thousand yen turned into thirty thousand yen before you knew it.

797
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,865
No matter how old you are, the behavior of worshiping idols is the same.

798
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:56,798
See you next time.

799
00:41:58,698 --> 00:41:59,966
Is there no next challenger?

800
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:01,534
Well?

801
00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:03,464
The winner can take the whole pot.

802
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:05,131
That's it.

803
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:06,533
That's the way.

804
00:42:08,132 --> 00:42:09,899
Better not...

805
00:42:10,198 --> 00:42:11,666
Are you stupid? What are you thinking?

806
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:12,900
You can win the whole pot.

807
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,732
Only a fool would do that.

808
00:42:15,397 --> 00:42:16,633
So was the uncle just now a fool?

809
00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:18,533
No, think about it.

810
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:21,330
We work so hard but don't have a dime left.

811
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:22,865
We have so much debt at so young.

812
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,966
Speaking of which, our situation is as bad as it can get.

813
00:42:27,698 --> 00:42:29,966
Now we can reverse the decline in one fell swoop.

814
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,366
We must make our stand here.

815
00:42:32,698 --> 00:42:34,231
Otherwise we'll be slaves our whole lives.

816
00:42:37,366 --> 00:42:38,865
No your eyes have changed.

817
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:41,966
As you like.

818
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,432
-Come on. -I can't

819
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:46,031
-It's okay. -Don't do this.

820
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,031
It'll be ready soon.

821
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,099
I absolutely won't do it.

822
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:53,498
Play a game.

823
00:42:56,999 --> 00:42:58,231
Please accompany me.

824
00:42:58,833 --> 00:42:59,833
This is not a place for children.

825
00:42:59,933 --> 00:43:03,231
- You'd better give up. - You're not going to win.

826
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,366
I can tell just by looking at your eyes.

827
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:09,633
You,

828
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:11,365
are not a careless person.

829
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:40,398
Huh?

830
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:44,767
Are you for real?

831
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,699
What move is this?

832
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:54,266
I don't get it.

833
00:43:58,799 --> 00:43:59,766
What is this strategy?

834
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,432
Will she win like this?

835
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:08,767
Mr. Tei's pressure failed.

836
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:10,933
Tell him to be careful.

837
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:14,535
Don't be fooled.

838
00:44:18,332 --> 00:44:19,166
Great,

839
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:23,734
Where to go? No way.

840
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,267
Win or lose,

841
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:46,933
We'll find out.

842
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:55,200
She's not good at all.

843
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,167
she's here to cause trouble, right?

844
00:44:57,233 --> 00:44:58,232
She's not suited for shogi.

845
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,634
Although she is very energetic.

846
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:02,701
Why is she here to play?

847
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:04,032
Forget it, let's go have a drink.

848
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:05,567
I won a lot today, it'll be my treat.

849
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:07,701
-Thank you. -Let's go.

850
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,568
Let's go.

851
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,935
Failure in gambling means,

852
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:47,466
Failure in life.

853
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:48,066
Embarassing.

854
00:45:48,433 --> 00:45:50,467
Get up, get up.

855
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:05,233
I knew it would go this way.

856
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:10,468
Sorry.

857
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:13,668
I have become an empty husk with nothing.

858
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,034
What a fool.

859
00:46:16,636 --> 00:46:17,400
You see,

860
00:46:17,934 --> 00:46:19,233
I bought bean sprouts.

861
00:46:20,002 --> 00:46:20,868
Bean sprouts?

862
00:46:21,034 --> 00:46:24,267
Once we plant em they'll keep growing, like a permanent organ.

863
00:46:25,902 --> 00:46:26,701
Good idea.

864
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:29,433
Thank you.

865
00:46:29,734 --> 00:46:30,701
It's time to go home.

866
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,735
I have to work tomorrow.

867
00:46:32,801 --> 00:46:33,602
Wait a moment.

868
00:46:35,467 --> 00:46:37,367
I swear to never gamble again.

869
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:39,936
You have to keep that promise.

870
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:40,869
Um

871
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:45,002
Just watch "Love Like a Bouquet" when you go back.

872
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,467
Okay, come and see.

873
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:05,701
So handsome.

874
00:47:06,066 --> 00:47:07,568
Maison Margiela.

875
00:47:09,101 --> 00:47:10,669
Just watch it when you relax.

876
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:12,535
I can't watch this and relax.

877
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:14,334
I can't remember it even after watching it.

878
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,635
During my break I just want to play "Puzzle and Dragons".

879
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:19,935
However,

880
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:22,969
It's all for life.

881
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:25,167
No hard feelings.

882
00:47:29,068 --> 00:47:30,801
We're together because we love each other.

883
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:31,635
Why?

884
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:33,234
You just want to make money.

885
00:47:36,635 --> 00:47:38,569
Because I want to be with you all the time.

886
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:39,969
Even if you ask me to do something I don't want to do...

887
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:42,233
I won't do anything I don't want to do.

888
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,836
I want to live happily.

889
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:46,670
Then get married.

890
00:47:47,135 --> 00:47:48,333
Get married.

891
00:47:48,467 --> 00:47:50,401
I will work hard to get money.

892
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:51,501
You just stay at home.

893
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,902
No need to go to work or do housework.

894
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:56,101
Just do what you like everyday.

895
00:47:57,135 --> 00:47:58,302
What are you...

896
00:47:58,435 --> 00:47:59,502
Proposing?

897
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:06,668
Its seems falling in love is also difficult.

898
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:08,569
Um,

899
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:10,670
I always feel,

900
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,835
The relationship obviously didn't go well.

901
00:48:13,802 --> 00:48:15,669
-But he said, "Then get married." -It's really scary.

902
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:16,970
"Let's get married"

903
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,368
"I will work hard to make money"

904
00:48:21,003 --> 00:48:23,004
I don't understand why the hero said that.

905
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,134
I haven't grown up yet.

906
00:48:27,602 --> 00:48:28,637
"Is this a proposal?"

907
00:48:30,301 --> 00:48:31,602
"Are you proposing to me now?"

908
00:48:36,002 --> 00:48:38,135
"It's not what I thought."

909
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:40,770
lines like this.

910
00:48:41,537 --> 00:48:44,468
But I really hope they can watch the guinea pig cross talk show.

911
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:45,769
Yes.

912
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:50,536
That scene in the family restaurant at the end.

913
00:48:51,003 --> 00:48:51,803
Great shot.

914
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,569
Is that a normal development?

915
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,301
By the way, Arimura Kame's innocence is so beautiful that it explodes.

916
00:49:01,802 --> 00:49:02,969
Real Maison Margiela.

917
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:06,301
I always care.

918
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:08,802
You just said "Maison Margiela" without starting or ending.

919
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:13,268
When I say "insanely handsome", I will at least consider the context.

920
00:49:13,501 --> 00:49:14,903
If you mess around like this, I can say whatever I want.

921
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,370
Cheap plastic wrap is like garbage.

922
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:28,136
That's why life just keeps getting worse.

923
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:29,403
Let's read the movie's review.

924
00:49:30,403 --> 00:49:31,769
Just love Izakaya and it’s like garbage.

925
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:38,102
Really Maison Margiela.

926
00:49:38,202 --> 00:49:38,936
I'm really angry.

927
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,538
Then get married.

928
00:49:54,236 --> 00:49:55,802
I want orange.

929
00:49:56,603 --> 00:49:57,402
Orange.

930
00:49:59,004 --> 00:50:01,102
They're tangled.

931
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:11,671
I didn’t expect that the taste of sausages at different prices is so different.

932
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:14,168
Um.

933
00:50:14,235 --> 00:50:19,537
Now that I think about it, I spent 1,300 on ramen because I was confused.

934
00:50:21,803 --> 00:50:22,638
Indeed.

935
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:24,671
Are you gonna bet on shogi again.

936
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:26,502
Huh? What are you saying?

937
00:50:27,136 --> 00:50:29,036
I asked if you are going to play shogi again.

938
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,203
Ah.

939
00:50:33,837 --> 00:50:36,470
Do you suspect me of gambling?

940
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:39,537
The absurd accusation made me not understand it for a second.

941
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:40,503
Quit acting.

942
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:44,837
You left the house two hours early.

943
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:47,905
No, I just wanted to go makeup shopping.

944
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:50,168
When changing clothes,

945
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,804
I smelt alcohol and cigarettes.

946
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,169
You still have uncle's white hair on your shirt.

947
00:50:59,604 --> 00:51:00,871
In your YouTube history,

948
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,103
There was "How to be better at Shogi"

949
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:05,303
I shouldn't share my account with you.

950
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:07,537
Are you a detective?

951
00:51:07,837 --> 00:51:08,637
Listen,

952
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:13,005
It doesn't matter how much money you lose.

953
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:17,270
But I hate people who don't keep their word, you know?

954
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:20,004
No, no, no, it's not...

955
00:51:20,937 --> 00:51:23,170
I didn't lose everything.

956
00:51:23,403 --> 00:51:26,136
Uncle gave me a plush doll that you like.

957
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:28,638
For you.

958
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:34,604
I don't need this kind of thing.

959
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:37,572
I finally made friends with uncle.

960
00:51:41,304 --> 00:51:42,605
I'm your friend too, right?

961
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,572
Got fired.

962
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:43,739
Worst case scenario.

963
00:52:45,938 --> 00:52:47,404
Mr. Matsumoto is so strong.

964
00:52:56,238 --> 00:52:57,037
Tasty.

965
00:52:59,204 --> 00:53:02,571
Nothing good will happen if I get involved with a gambler like you.

966
00:53:03,104 --> 00:53:03,905
I'm very sorry.

967
00:53:04,704 --> 00:53:05,906
I look for another job.

968
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,137
The days when you can’t even afford McDonald’s.

969
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:26,671
Big Mac's cost like 390 yen, right?

970
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,170
Really?

971
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,471
I don't even know the current price.

972
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,540
I really don't know

973
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:38,738
Also,

974
00:53:39,404 --> 00:53:40,204
That,

975
00:53:42,338 --> 00:53:43,606
That's Big Mac

976
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:47,471
Burger and Cheeseburger stacked on top of eachother.

977
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,405
Do you remember the boy who said this?

978
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,571
Also said,

979
00:53:53,237 --> 00:53:54,872
"Buy a double cheeseburger"

980
00:53:54,872 --> 00:53:57,204
"It's better to buy two Cheeseburgers"

981
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,939
Do you remember a boy saying that?

982
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:05,171
How to love is personal freedom.

983
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:09,705
I know full well that I was just fooled by McDonald's.

984
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:11,572
I think the same thing when I eat McDonald's.

985
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:16,170
But even when he tells me the truth directly,

986
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,972
I still won't be happy.

987
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:21,971
I don't care if I'm being fooled.

988
00:54:22,104 --> 00:54:22,906
What do you think?

989
00:54:25,238 --> 00:54:26,973
Puzzle and Dragons doesn't excite me either.

990
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:30,773
Huh? Why?

991
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,540
Are you listening?

992
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:53,540
Ah,

993
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:55,706
There's a pachinko parlour. Do you want to go?

994
00:54:56,873 --> 00:54:57,639
I don't wanna go.

995
00:54:57,872 --> 00:54:59,272
You're not going, right?

996
00:54:59,705 --> 00:55:00,438
What for?

997
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:06,105
You were just staring at shogi. If you want to go, you can go.

998
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:07,773
you misunderstood,

999
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:09,906
I only have eyes for you.

1000
00:55:11,372 --> 00:55:14,541
I won't be drawn to gamble in a crisis.

1001
00:55:15,273 --> 00:55:17,505
So I don't want to work with you.

1002
00:55:18,472 --> 00:55:22,272
By the way, you hit my head with your knee, and now it hurts.

1003
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:26,273
Oh, it hurts? You deserved it.

1004
00:55:26,874 --> 00:55:30,873
By the way, your flying kick didn't hurt. You need more practice.

1005
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,774
I don't feel any pain at all.

1006
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:33,872
Didn't you just say it hurts?

1007
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:37,740
I would have won without Mr. Matsumoto.

1008
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,406
what? Are you blaming Mr. Matsumoto now?

1009
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:40,372
-Hmm -What?

1010
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:41,606
Do you know,

1011
00:55:41,907 --> 00:55:44,874
People who are dishonest are likely to become addicted to gambling.

1012
00:55:45,073 --> 00:55:45,872
Good.

1013
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:48,238
After we kill them, I'll ask her out.

1014
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:50,473
It’s best to ask her out to eat shabu-shabu at Aoyama.

1015
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:53,438
I should get her a gift.

1016
00:55:53,472 --> 00:55:54,740
-Cartier? -To Cartier.

1017
00:55:55,139 --> 00:55:55,907
of perfume…

1018
00:55:56,007 --> 00:55:58,472
Perfume is not good, a person's taste can vary too much.

1019
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,673
Really?

1020
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:01,907
But I have to give her something in return.

1021
00:56:02,072 --> 00:56:04,573
Suddenly give her perfume...

1022
00:56:05,038 --> 00:56:05,907
It doesn't matter. I'll accompany you to pick it out.

1023
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:07,807
I can rest assured then.

1024
00:56:09,073 --> 00:56:10,839
Speaking of, this seems to be a new gun.

1025
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:13,439
Yes, Mr. Akagi got them for us.

1026
00:56:14,741 --> 00:56:15,541
Cool.

1027
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,405
It's decided.

1028
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,606
Nice.

1029
00:56:35,706 --> 00:56:36,506
Thanks for your hard work.

1030
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:38,206
Thanks for your hard work.

1031
00:56:38,306 --> 00:56:39,841
The flash bomb is so cool.

1032
00:56:40,706 --> 00:56:42,106
Solved it all in one go.

1033
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,774
Well I've finished it little guy.

1034
00:56:45,307 --> 00:56:46,207
Always so easy.

1035
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,139
Just like the bank robbers before him.

1036
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:50,841
I hope to meet a stronger opponent.

1037
00:56:52,472 --> 00:56:53,840
How did you discover them?

1038
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:55,807
Um,

1039
00:56:55,941 --> 00:56:57,742
I smelt gun smoke.

1040
00:56:57,974 --> 00:56:59,640
They're wearing combat boots again.

1041
00:57:00,106 --> 00:57:02,040
I just told you to stop on purpose.

1042
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,240
I saw them acting strangely.

1043
00:57:03,642 --> 00:57:07,172
Strikeouts are like "Teenage Killer Emergency"

1044
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:08,974
How did you find out?

1045
00:57:09,207 --> 00:57:10,140
Um.

1046
00:57:12,707 --> 00:57:13,506
Intuition.

1047
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:14,641
Really, awesome.

1048
00:57:15,507 --> 00:57:17,439
Anyway, ask Mr. Tasaka to clean it up?

1049
00:57:18,674 --> 00:57:20,374
Yeah.

1050
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,741
Wait a moment.

1051
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,407
Didn't it say not to kill people?

1052
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:29,473
We don't know their identities.

1053
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,841
but they attacked us with guns.

1054
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:34,507
Even so.

1055
00:57:35,373 --> 00:57:38,073
It's stipulated that no one is too be killed during suspension.

1056
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:39,942
But...

1057
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:42,641
Miss Sugimoto Gambler

1058
00:57:42,941 --> 00:57:46,440
If you want to kill someone, I won't stop you.

1059
00:57:46,642 --> 00:57:47,439
Ah.

1060
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,406
How long are you gonna be mad?

1061
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:02,642
Are you two suspended from work now?

1062
00:58:04,775 --> 00:58:06,373
Suspended, right?

1063
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:07,240
Yes.

1064
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,474
The identities of those two persons are unknown.

1065
00:58:11,108 --> 00:58:12,741
It may not be covered by insurance claims.

1066
00:58:12,908 --> 00:58:14,207
No way.

1067
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,074
They had guns.

1068
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:19,574
Same as the last bank robbery,

1069
00:58:19,674 --> 00:58:21,909
It's all avoidable.

1070
00:58:24,206 --> 00:58:27,307
It would be easier to talk if you were shot,

1071
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:28,842
If you get shot, you'll die.

1072
00:58:29,241 --> 00:58:31,374
Yes. Please take this.

1073
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:32,608
and this.

1074
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:33,842
You can do this

1075
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:34,942
Do what?

1076
00:58:37,941 --> 00:58:38,742
This can be avoided.

1077
00:58:38,842 --> 00:58:40,041
So awesome.

1078
00:58:40,108 --> 00:58:42,607
avoid like this.

1079
00:58:42,741 --> 00:58:43,807
So cool.

1080
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,208
What's so interesting about it?

1081
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:48,008
This can be avoided.

1082
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:50,240
Like this.

1083
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:52,074
This report.

1084
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:53,508
Don't forget to pay.

1085
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:54,874
-So lazy -What?

1086
00:58:55,307 --> 00:58:58,009
Who are they?

1087
00:58:58,508 --> 00:59:01,207
Judging from the serial number of the gun, it belongs to our organization.

1088
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:03,208
Ask the intermediary and you will know immediately.

1089
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,375
Lady in the Palace, please write down the number.

1090
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:06,506
I have written it down.

1091
00:59:09,842 --> 00:59:11,275
Ah trouble.

1092
00:59:11,543 --> 00:59:13,642
Ah, so busy.

1093
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:14,642
Really busy.

1094
00:59:15,808 --> 00:59:17,676
I'm really busy.

1095
00:59:17,776 --> 00:59:19,274
You're really good. Write down the number immediately.

1096
00:59:21,174 --> 00:59:23,108
I feel tired just thinking about writing a report.

1097
00:59:24,974 --> 00:59:26,274
Yes.

1098
00:59:26,474 --> 00:59:27,341
So lazy.

1099
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:29,241
And it also requires handwriting.

1100
00:59:29,308 --> 00:59:31,975
Yes, it need to be written by hand.

1101
00:59:32,274 --> 00:59:33,009
I'm busy.

1102
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:38,474
It's the middle of the night again, and it's a Yakuza office again.

1103
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,508
You have to dispose of the body so late. Are you kidding me?

1104
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:43,875
What should I do in times like this...

1105
00:59:45,009 --> 00:59:45,842
A ball pen?

1106
00:59:46,508 --> 00:59:48,507
Oh ball pen

1107
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:50,474
Yes ball pen.

1108
00:59:50,942 --> 00:59:51,743
And...

1109
00:59:51,975 --> 00:59:56,975
I also need to buy envelopes. There's a lot too do,

1110
00:59:57,108 --> 00:59:58,508
I always feel like I have such a backlog.

1111
00:59:58,609 --> 01:00:00,240
I know.

1112
01:00:00,307 --> 01:00:01,107
You understand.

1113
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,942
One day I want to...

1114
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:05,209
Ah, it's over, it's over.

1115
01:00:06,608 --> 01:00:07,407
It's over.

1116
01:00:07,742 --> 01:00:08,575
It's over.

1117
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:12,209
I want to watch the “Relaxation Real Estate” video when I get home.

1118
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,642
then have a drink.

1119
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:17,476
The bathhouse is also good. There is a sauna there.

1120
01:00:17,577 --> 01:00:19,608
Just go to the bathhouse to heal your body and mind.

1121
01:00:19,975 --> 01:00:23,409
Going to a sauna will make you sleepy. If you are sleepy, you can’t drink.

1122
01:00:23,577 --> 01:00:24,808
So after drinking, I went to the sauna,

1123
01:00:24,975 --> 01:00:28,809
But that would destroy the body and mind and risk death.

1124
01:00:29,943 --> 01:00:31,742
Does he always talk to himself like that?

1125
01:00:32,074 --> 01:00:32,875
Yeah, basically.

1126
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:34,109
Really hard work.

1127
01:00:34,576 --> 01:00:35,644
-disgusting -terrible

1128
01:00:36,742 --> 01:00:39,174
What do you two do after get off work?

1129
01:00:39,976 --> 01:00:41,876
Yeah, go shopping or something like that.

1130
01:00:43,642 --> 01:00:46,242
Or go to movies or concerts.

1131
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:48,309
Right.

1132
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:52,843
Where is the Lady in the Palace?

1133
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,241
Any entertainment?

1134
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:58,142
Recently I like to play Catan while smoking shisha.

1135
01:00:58,409 --> 01:01:00,242
Play Catan while smoking shisha?

1136
01:01:00,509 --> 01:01:02,141
There is indeed such a way to play.

1137
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,074
Because I'm a hottie.

1138
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:04,776
Got girl.

1139
01:01:05,744 --> 01:01:08,009
-hot girl. -super cute.

1140
01:01:08,776 --> 01:01:09,576
Not bad hot girl.

1141
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:11,242
-hot girl -great great.

1142
01:01:11,342 --> 01:01:12,209
Mr. Tasaka.

1143
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,275
Why don't you make a gesture too?

1144
01:01:14,543 --> 01:01:15,341
What?

1145
01:01:15,408 --> 01:01:16,276
Make the hot girl gesture.

1146
01:01:16,577 --> 01:01:17,476
What happened to the hot girl?

1147
01:01:17,744 --> 01:01:18,544
That's hot girl.

1148
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:19,975
-What's that? -Don't you know?

1149
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:22,409
-TikTok videos? -Don't you know?

1150
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:23,309
It turns out he knew.

1151
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:25,108
Please do the hot girl gesture,

1152
01:01:25,341 --> 01:01:27,308
-Do I have to do it? - please.

1153
01:01:27,709 --> 01:01:30,877
-Okay, I'll go home after I'm done. -Okay.

1154
01:01:30,977 --> 01:01:32,643
1, 2, 3 hot girls.

1155
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:37,875
-It's wonderful. -It's amazing.

1156
01:01:37,975 --> 01:01:38,375
So awesome.

1157
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,476
You are really good at hot girls and work.

1158
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,876
Work is really my strength.

1159
01:01:44,976 --> 01:01:47,577
I hope to set an example and inspire you.

1160
01:01:47,677 --> 01:01:50,308
I hope you can also work hard to be professionals.

1161
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:52,844
Please give me more advice. Lady in the palace, you can get off work now.

1162
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,377
-Okay -Thank you for your hard work.

1163
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,676
Wait a minute. They escaped.

1164
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:57,943
Wow, wait a minute. No way.

1165
01:01:58,544 --> 01:02:00,011
What's up?

1166
01:02:01,277 --> 01:02:03,075
We finally defeated them.

1167
01:02:03,876 --> 01:02:04,710
What a tragedy. I was tricked.

1168
01:02:08,876 --> 01:02:09,943
Go to hell.

1169
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:13,609
you can't shoot.

1170
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:14,809
No, no, no, what are you doing?

1171
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:16,977
Put the gun down right now.

1172
01:02:18,143 --> 01:02:19,809
We can't let them escape.

1173
01:02:20,576 --> 01:02:22,342
Ah, we screwed up.

1174
01:02:23,442 --> 01:02:24,944
You'll get scolded if you do that.

1175
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:26,743
Then shoot them.

1176
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:29,677
You just can't make a quick decision and you can't get ahead.

1177
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:30,678
Get ahead?

1178
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,142
In short,

1179
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:33,644
Lady in the palace, you can get off work now.

1180
01:02:33,943 --> 01:02:35,442
I will try to find them.

1181
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:37,277
No, I'll help you.

1182
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:39,910
If you get killed, I'll be in a bad mood.

1183
01:02:39,976 --> 01:02:40,777
Bad mood?

1184
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,745
Really.

1185
01:02:43,976 --> 01:02:45,777
I didn't want to use this gun.

1186
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:51,276
Need help?

1187
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:52,644
Chasing people is our strength.

1188
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:57,744
Please.

1189
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:00,745
-Huh? -what?

1190
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,676
Did you hear anything?

1191
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:03,677
I heard nothing.

1192
01:03:03,844 --> 01:03:04,644
Yes.

1193
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,310
Please.

1194
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,911
OK.

1195
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,477
Borrowed,

1196
01:03:18,645 --> 01:03:19,477
The power of both of them.

1197
01:03:20,644 --> 01:03:22,710
I'll go look for them too.

1198
01:03:22,944 --> 01:03:23,745
Sorry.

1199
01:03:27,577 --> 01:03:28,376
No way.

1200
01:03:28,944 --> 01:03:30,645
Are you bullying me?

1201
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:32,044
How could this happen?

1202
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:36,945
The atmosphere was obviously very good, but it was all ruined.

1203
01:03:38,044 --> 01:03:38,810
never mind.

1204
01:03:39,276 --> 01:03:42,443
As a cleaning expert, I have to clean this mess up.

1205
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:44,211
Make them weak with fear.

1206
01:03:44,644 --> 01:03:46,577
Make them weak with fear.

1207
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:48,377
You will regret it.

1208
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:00,711
Mr. Tasaka.

1209
01:04:01,444 --> 01:04:02,710
Are you okay?

1210
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:05,778
so hot.

1211
01:04:06,778 --> 01:04:08,677
There are so many mosquitoes.

1212
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:14,177
Mr. Tasaka?

1213
01:04:15,276 --> 01:04:17,176
Mr. Tasaka, are you okay?

1214
01:04:19,811 --> 01:04:20,577
Ah.

1215
01:04:21,176 --> 01:04:22,011
Lady in the palace.

1216
01:04:23,711 --> 01:04:26,144
Those two took my gun away.

1217
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,011
I've been shot.

1218
01:04:31,945 --> 01:04:32,710
Call the ambulance team quickly.

1219
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:34,477
Wait a moment

1220
01:04:36,678 --> 01:04:38,411
I must explain something before I die.

1221
01:04:39,011 --> 01:04:39,944
Explain what?

1222
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,478
If I die,

1223
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,944
Please use alcohol to clean the blood on the floor.

1224
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:47,845
then in the van,

1225
01:04:48,645 --> 01:04:49,812
Cover with blue plastic sheeting.

1226
01:04:50,812 --> 01:04:51,944
Use that to wrap the body again.

1227
01:04:51,977 --> 01:04:53,277
Mr. Tasaka.

1228
01:04:53,978 --> 01:04:54,711
Right.

1229
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:56,344
and…

1230
01:05:05,012 --> 01:05:05,811
this.

1231
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:09,711
What is this?

1232
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:12,646
The state of the corpse must be clearly written.

1233
01:05:13,478 --> 01:05:15,545
The handler will take the case.

1234
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:18,344
I'll tell you my current situation.

1235
01:05:19,244 --> 01:05:20,312
you write it down.

1236
01:05:21,678 --> 01:05:22,578
Why are you doing this?

1237
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:26,078
Lady in the palace.

1238
01:05:31,111 --> 01:05:31,913
Please switch identities.

1239
01:05:40,912 --> 01:05:41,678
Yes.

1240
01:05:46,012 --> 01:05:47,878
The name of the processing object is.

1241
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,078
Tasaka Mamoru

1242
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:53,978
abdomen.

1243
01:05:54,946 --> 01:05:55,846
There is a gunshot wound.

1244
01:05:57,045 --> 01:05:57,978
cause heavy bleeding.

1245
01:06:01,746 --> 01:06:02,779
Tasaka Mamoru.

1246
01:06:03,945 --> 01:06:04,745
abdomen.

1247
01:06:06,111 --> 01:06:06,913
There was a gunshot wound…

1248
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:10,278
Huh?

1249
01:06:12,779 --> 01:06:14,312
Mr. Tasaka, you were shot.

1250
01:06:14,547 --> 01:06:15,547
Are you okay?

1251
01:06:15,778 --> 01:06:16,545
Um.

1252
01:06:17,444 --> 01:06:20,580
I was hit by those two people.

1253
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:30,211
Which direction did they flee to?

1254
01:06:38,045 --> 01:06:38,847
Over there?

1255
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,678
When were you shot?

1256
01:06:43,913 --> 01:06:44,813
4 minutes ago.

1257
01:06:45,747 --> 01:06:46,745
There may be blood on the road.

1258
01:06:47,012 --> 01:06:47,879
Let's find it quickly now.

1259
01:06:49,812 --> 01:06:50,547
He asked you to.

1260
01:06:51,512 --> 01:06:52,311
Yes.

1261
01:06:54,913 --> 01:06:56,580
They work really hard.

1262
01:06:59,244 --> 01:07:00,078
Ah.

1263
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:01,512
My head!

1264
01:07:02,512 --> 01:07:03,780
My head really hurts!

1265
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,979
Because I was stepped on and kicked again.

1266
01:07:08,013 --> 01:07:10,546
Is it true？You failed.

1267
01:07:11,077 --> 01:07:12,145
Ah,

1268
01:07:12,212 --> 01:07:15,213
You also revealed the serial number of the gun.

1269
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,444
Terrible.

1270
01:07:17,144 --> 01:07:18,379
Listen,

1271
01:07:18,979 --> 01:07:20,680
Let's meet in Tokyo first... Hello?

1272
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,179
Hello?

1273
01:07:22,311 --> 01:07:24,546
Why does Wi-Fi disconnect at this time?

1274
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:26,880
Are you kidding me?

1275
01:07:30,512 --> 01:07:31,312
Huh?

1276
01:07:32,947 --> 01:07:33,747
What?

1277
01:07:40,313 --> 01:07:41,112
What's up?

1278
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:42,345
Hey wait a minute.

1279
01:07:43,547 --> 01:07:44,547
Wait for me.

1280
01:08:24,412 --> 01:08:25,713
Mr. Susano, you are here.

1281
01:08:26,246 --> 01:08:29,580
I thought I was dead this time.

1282
01:08:29,646 --> 01:08:32,146
I was shocked.

1283
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:34,581
I heard you were shot. I thought you were really going to die.

1284
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:35,846
What a close call.

1285
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:39,079
This man also wrote his own autopsy report.

1286
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,245
This kind of person has a bad personality, right?

1287
01:08:41,512 --> 01:08:43,613
I really thought I was going to die.

1288
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,748
Before I was shot, I exerted force on my abdomen.

1289
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:46,981
Only then did the bullet slip through and avoid death.

1290
01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:48,613
What is it, Tasaka?

1291
01:08:48,914 --> 01:08:49,813
You are in good condition.

1292
01:08:49,914 --> 01:08:51,480
Please don't do this...it hurts.

1293
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,412
By the way, have you caught the two people who shot me?

1294
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,146
Not caught yet, but the broker was caught.

1295
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:59,312
Really? Who are they?

1296
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,079
They are the workers who contracted our cases.

1297
01:09:01,146 --> 01:09:02,413
Wow it's pudding.

1298
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,714
Ah pudding.

1299
01:09:03,915 --> 01:09:06,613
The agency's reputation is very tight and it wastes a lot of time.

1300
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:09,981
We just had a meeting and decided to eliminate those two killers.

1301
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:12,279
Anyway, "Mr. Purge" will handle this case.

1302
01:09:12,379 --> 01:09:13,413
"Mr. Purge" will not appear.

1303
01:09:13,713 --> 01:09:15,380
For "Mr Purge" to appear something big has to happen.

1304
01:09:15,581 --> 01:09:17,947
Isn't it a big deal that I was shot?

1305
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:20,748
I heard they mistakenly believed "killed a regular killer".

1306
01:09:21,213 --> 01:09:24,112
The rumor that "working people can join organizations and rise up".

1307
01:09:25,446 --> 01:09:27,413
Why would you believe this rumor?

1308
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,680
-Do you want a picture together? -No

1309
01:09:29,747 --> 01:09:30,547
Really?

1310
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,681
Are Chisato and Mahiro chasing those two people?

1311
01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:35,580
No. They are on suspension.

1312
01:09:36,014 --> 01:09:38,213
They were found in the morning and are now sleeping.

1313
01:09:38,881 --> 01:09:39,681
Uh.

1314
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:42,345
It doesn't matter who kills them.

1315
01:09:42,947 --> 01:09:45,881
The most important thing is to clean it up.

1316
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:48,379
The pudding is so delicious.

1317
01:09:48,445 --> 01:09:49,280
It's delicious, right?

1318
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,313
-Yummy. -Really?

1319
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,180
Eat quickly.

1320
01:09:51,247 --> 01:09:52,147
Where did you buy this?

1321
01:09:52,214 --> 01:09:53,180
-Station. -Station.

1322
01:09:53,247 --> 01:09:54,246
So there is delicious food at the station.

1323
01:09:54,346 --> 01:09:55,313
-I'm starting. -Eat quickly.

1324
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:56,179
Please do.

1325
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,046
-Wait a minute. -What's wrong?

1326
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:00,980
Huh?

1327
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,649
-Delicious. -What?

1328
01:10:05,715 --> 01:10:07,648
Why are you asking us to wait?

1329
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:11,682
-Wait a minute. -What happened?

1330
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:13,814
-It's delicious. -So why do you have to wait?

1331
01:10:14,346 --> 01:10:15,247
What does "wait a minute" mean?

1332
01:10:15,481 --> 01:10:16,381
what do you mean.

1333
01:10:16,481 --> 01:10:17,615
Why do hot girls make us wait?

1334
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:18,813
Wait a moment.

1335
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,781
what?

1336
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,281
-Delicious, right? -Um

1337
01:10:45,347 --> 01:10:47,682
You haven't made an appointment with that clerk yet, have you?

1338
01:10:48,346 --> 01:10:51,080
Yes.

1339
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:55,313
I also have some serious business that I haven’t finished yet.

1340
01:11:09,481 --> 01:11:10,347
I want to help you take revenge.

1341
01:11:16,882 --> 01:11:18,413
First time ordering this set meal.

1342
01:11:18,648 --> 01:11:19,446
Uh.

1343
01:11:20,314 --> 01:11:21,782
If we win, we can eat it every day.

1344
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:24,382
Every day...

1345
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:25,814
every day.

1346
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:27,582
By the way...

1347
01:11:27,882 --> 01:11:29,583
appointment

1348
01:11:30,714 --> 01:11:31,714
It's time for me to ask for a date.

1349
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:34,882
Too bad.

1350
01:11:35,148 --> 01:11:36,981
When I get nervous, my throat becomes unable to make a sound.

1351
01:11:38,749 --> 01:11:40,882
If you want to date her, you need to be smarter.

1352
01:11:41,248 --> 01:11:42,614
-Be neat and tidy -Be neat and tidy

1353
01:11:42,714 --> 01:11:45,982
Great 680 yen.

1354
01:11:46,414 --> 01:11:48,714
This is the cheapest paradise in Tokyo.

1355
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:49,915
Excuse me.

1356
01:11:50,582 --> 01:11:51,481
So hot.

1357
01:11:55,781 --> 01:11:56,582
tea please.

1358
01:11:56,682 --> 01:11:57,782
We're going to order the chicken steak set meal for two.

1359
01:11:58,215 --> 01:11:59,016
Where's the meal?

1360
01:11:59,081 --> 01:11:59,883
Two small bowls.

1361
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:00,750
OK.

1362
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:03,247
well,

1363
01:12:04,016 --> 01:12:07,714
I searched all night and my back ached.

1364
01:12:08,047 --> 01:12:09,549
This is all for Tasaka.

1365
01:12:10,348 --> 01:12:11,683
The tea at the restaurant is the best.

1366
01:12:12,482 --> 01:12:14,549
Compared to all drinks?

1367
01:12:14,682 --> 01:12:15,481
In the summer,

1368
01:12:15,715 --> 01:12:17,515
The point is that in a store that is not very cool.

1369
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,047
Uh,

1370
01:12:19,814 --> 01:12:20,582
looks so delicious.

1371
01:12:21,815 --> 01:12:23,750
Don't keep staring at neighbours.

1372
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:24,650
Because it looks delicious.

1373
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,347
Sprinkled a bunch of seven-flavor powder.

1374
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,882
It does look delicious.

1375
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:30,917
It really costs 1,000 yen.

1376
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:32,447
So expensive.

1377
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:33,514
You know the teishoku restaurant.

1378
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,049
Are there 700, 800, 900, 1000 levels?

1379
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:42,182
Do you mean ordering based on the situation at hand?

1380
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:43,682
Yeah, that's right.

1381
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:44,916
Uh.

1382
01:12:45,749 --> 01:12:47,683
Indeed not long ago.

1383
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,448
I don’t feel comfortable spending 1,000 yen at a supermarket.

1384
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:52,616
Ah, stop talking...

1385
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:55,281
No.

1386
01:12:55,414 --> 01:12:56,281
very happy now.

1387
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:58,850
This is the current situation...

1388
01:12:58,917 --> 01:12:59,716
Excuse me.

1389
01:13:04,883 --> 01:13:05,683
That was…

1390
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:09,081
Very tasty.

1391
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:10,448
ah.

1392
01:13:10,883 --> 01:13:12,082
Thank you.

1393
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,849
I just want to thank you for your craftsmanship.

1394
01:13:16,148 --> 01:13:18,283
This is what my mother made.

1395
01:13:18,983 --> 01:13:20,849
That's it.

1396
01:13:22,515 --> 01:13:23,482
I will convey it.

1397
01:13:23,683 --> 01:13:24,483
Please.

1398
01:13:25,283 --> 01:13:26,181
Thank you.

1399
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:27,550
Thank you.

1400
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:33,048
Ah, it's a little hot.

1401
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:36,216
Oh it's that children's science show.

1402
01:13:36,316 --> 01:13:37,116
What is that?

1403
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:38,215
Huh?

1404
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,017
Sorry for the wait.

1405
01:14:11,116 --> 01:14:12,017
looks delicious.

1406
01:14:12,383 --> 01:14:13,516
Wow looks so delicious.

1407
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:15,081
Wow.

1408
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:16,716
Very good.

1409
01:14:16,783 --> 01:14:17,983
Comes with pickles.

1410
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:21,616
This is only 680 yen...so happy.

1411
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:22,783
marvelous.

1412
01:14:22,883 --> 01:14:25,083
-Please eat it slowly -Thank you very much.

1413
01:14:28,082 --> 01:14:29,449
I started.

1414
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:31,984
I'll kill you if you dare to move.

1415
01:14:38,816 --> 01:14:39,917
You don't want to cause a commotion, do you?

1416
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:45,115
What is your purpose? Have a grudge against us?

1417
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,350
Cat got your tongue?

1418
01:14:51,215 --> 01:14:53,017
I really want to eat freshly fried chicken steak.

1419
01:15:13,018 --> 01:15:13,851
I want to checkout.

1420
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:15,917
Go quickly.

1421
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,716
I was scared to death. I thought I was going to die.

1422
01:15:27,383 --> 01:15:28,751
I was scared to death. I thought you were dead.

1423
01:15:29,216 --> 01:15:30,050
What what?

1424
01:15:30,384 --> 01:15:32,750
-What are you doing? -I'm sorry.

1425
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:34,983
If you want to play cops and robbers, go outside!

1426
01:15:35,149 --> 01:15:36,851
Can you move? Are you okay?

1427
01:15:36,918 --> 01:15:38,018
Yeah, it's okay.

1428
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,216
Really? Is it okay?

1429
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:41,082
Yeah I'm strong.

1430
01:15:41,383 --> 01:15:43,652
Hurt my partner and I want you to see the coffin.

1431
01:15:43,852 --> 01:15:45,383
Wow, I’m angry. I’m angry.

1432
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:48,083
Thanks for the treat. Sorry for the mess.

1433
01:15:48,317 --> 01:15:51,283
I want to check out. No need for change.

1434
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:58,116
Sorry, I'd better get change.

1435
01:15:58,182 --> 01:15:59,851
That's enough. Let's go.

1436
01:16:00,117 --> 01:16:02,484
I'll come back to eat later,

1437
01:16:20,517 --> 01:16:21,516
Let's split up here.

1438
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:23,751
I will call those two out to end it.

1439
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:24,752
what?

1440
01:16:24,984 --> 01:16:25,818
See you later.

1441
01:16:26,618 --> 01:16:28,149
What nonsense are you talking about, brother?

1442
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,317
You can't win alone.

1443
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:32,485
We'll work together to knock them down.

1444
01:16:32,585 --> 01:16:34,283
-Makoto -Fuck em up,

1445
01:16:34,483 --> 01:16:35,317
I have,

1446
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:37,752
No matter the association, no matter the killer regulations,

1447
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:40,684
Regardless of my future life, it doesn't matter.

1448
01:16:40,984 --> 01:16:41,784
At least,

1449
01:16:43,585 --> 01:16:45,218
At least knock those two people down.

1450
01:16:46,516 --> 01:16:48,785
Let's fight together and defeat them together.

1451
01:16:55,718 --> 01:16:56,485
Yes.

1452
01:16:58,984 --> 01:16:59,918
we absolutely have to win.

1453
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:02,084
Yes.

1454
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:13,652
My blood is boiling.

1455
01:17:30,952 --> 01:17:31,752
Ah.

1456
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:35,018
Should we contact Mr. Susano first?

1457
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,785
No, just report it afterwards,

1458
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:41,284
No? No.

1459
01:17:44,385 --> 01:17:47,083
So really delicious Japanese food.

1460
01:17:47,183 --> 01:17:48,852
It's very layered.

1461
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:50,986
-You absolutely don't understand what that feels like. -What does that mean?

1462
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:51,886
Like,

1463
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:52,984
Same as perfume.

1464
01:17:53,217 --> 01:17:54,317
-perfume? -perfume.

1465
01:17:54,384 --> 01:17:55,318
You compare Japanese food to perfume?

1466
01:17:55,318 --> 01:17:56,418
Yes, for the convenience of your understanding.

1467
01:17:56,418 --> 01:17:57,986
Because both of them are from Kyoto...

1468
01:17:58,117 --> 01:17:58,918
Hello.

1469
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,952
You have worked hard,

1470
01:18:01,285 --> 01:18:02,084
What's the matter?

1471
01:18:02,184 --> 01:18:03,252
Well, that,

1472
01:18:03,451 --> 01:18:05,752
We found the two killers.

1473
01:18:06,218 --> 01:18:07,251
Can they be taken out?

1474
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:08,853
what?

1475
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,585
The norm during suspension is...

1476
01:18:12,685 --> 01:18:15,419
I don't care about norms. What I want to express is passion.

1477
01:18:15,553 --> 01:18:17,217
Hot-blooded? What is that?

1478
01:18:17,417 --> 01:18:19,385
Even during suspension,

1479
01:18:19,553 --> 01:18:22,384
It makes no sense for an assassin not to kill the enemy in front of him.

1480
01:18:22,818 --> 01:18:25,351
Yes, what we assassins know best is killing people.

1481
01:18:25,518 --> 01:18:27,020
Even if you say so...

1482
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:29,417
Mr. Susano, what happened?

1483
01:18:29,718 --> 01:18:32,953
Chisato Kazuma found the two killers.

1484
01:18:32,953 --> 01:18:34,020
She also said she would kill them.

1485
01:18:34,152 --> 01:18:35,752
But they are on suspension.

1486
01:18:36,418 --> 01:18:37,318
I don't know what to do either.

1487
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:41,184
Then let me entrust it, right?

1488
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:43,218
-Huh? -what?

1489
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,585
I named them to kill those two people.

1490
01:18:47,218 --> 01:18:49,351
This qualifies for the exception.

1491
01:18:52,152 --> 01:18:54,818
A killer cannot kill because of personal grudges.

1492
01:18:55,184 --> 01:18:57,754
I can just entrust them with killing people.

1493
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:00,653
What you said is reasonable, but why do you do this?

1494
01:19:01,518 --> 01:19:02,653
You have to pay for this out of your own pocket.

1495
01:19:03,219 --> 01:19:04,020
No.

1496
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:06,118
My senior was shot. I was so angry.

1497
01:19:06,686 --> 01:19:07,686
I'm so angry.

1498
01:19:09,185 --> 01:19:10,219
The answer is so simple.

1499
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:12,719
Aren't you angry when you were shot?

1500
01:19:13,553 --> 01:19:15,687
I'm so angry. I'm so angry.

1501
01:19:16,286 --> 01:19:17,585
That's what you can't do.

1502
01:19:18,819 --> 01:19:20,819
Slavery goes deep into the bone marrow.

1503
01:19:21,587 --> 01:19:22,654
servility…

1504
01:19:24,118 --> 01:19:25,653
I understand. I'll pay for that.

1505
01:19:25,753 --> 01:19:27,519
No, no need.

1506
01:19:27,954 --> 01:19:30,853
Because even if you get shot, it doesn't matter.

1507
01:19:31,052 --> 01:19:32,452
I'm not indifferent.

1508
01:19:32,654 --> 01:19:34,185
See everyone is so worried about me.

1509
01:19:34,286 --> 01:19:36,686
I act cheerful on purpose.

1510
01:19:36,786 --> 01:19:38,085
Let others decide whether you are cheerful or not.

1511
01:19:38,419 --> 01:19:41,251
What are you talking about? I'm in a hurry now.

1512
01:19:41,653 --> 01:19:42,451
Um.

1513
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:43,451
Basically

1514
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:44,754
Go ahead.

1515
01:19:46,452 --> 01:19:48,118
Ah, you agreed?

1516
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:48,986
Yes.

1517
01:19:49,185 --> 01:19:50,020
Please play your part.

1518
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,620
We will do something wonderful.

1519
01:19:53,418 --> 01:19:54,619
Very good.

1520
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,886
-Hi, it's Tasaka. -I'm so happy.

1521
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,086
You have worked hard.

1522
01:19:58,153 --> 01:19:59,418
Thanks for your hard work.

1523
01:19:59,653 --> 01:20:00,485
That...

1524
01:20:00,586 --> 01:20:02,887
-Gotta get it clean. -Yeah, we'll get it clean.

1525
01:20:06,118 --> 01:20:06,953
You can do whatever you want.

1526
01:20:09,152 --> 01:20:10,587
-Huh? -You can play as much as you want.

1527
01:20:11,485 --> 01:20:12,485
Can you play to your heart's content?

1528
01:20:12,485 --> 01:20:14,486
You can chop them into pieces, or you can chop them into pieces.

1529
01:20:14,754 --> 01:20:15,587
Chop it into pieces?

1530
01:20:15,587 --> 01:20:18,351
You can also chop it into puree and make it sticky and rotten.

1531
01:20:18,518 --> 01:20:19,219
Chop it into pieces?

1532
01:20:19,786 --> 01:20:20,787
Sticky and rotten...

1533
01:20:21,921 --> 01:20:23,153
No matter how dirty the place is,

1534
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:26,386
Both I and she will clean it up, right?

1535
01:20:26,519 --> 01:20:28,687
Yes, leave it to me.

1536
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:34,453
Please kill the bastard who shot me in the stomach.

1537
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,419
Roger.

1538
01:21:02,854 --> 01:21:03,320
Do you want it?

1539
01:21:03,687 --> 01:21:04,688
Thanks.

1540
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:27,855
Really strong.

1541
01:23:29,121 --> 01:23:30,354
Professional assassins are awesome.

1542
01:23:30,421 --> 01:23:31,220
Yes.

1543
01:23:32,287 --> 01:23:33,087
However,

1544
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:35,022
We didn't lose either.

1545
01:23:35,556 --> 01:23:37,888
Of course, idiot, we will win.

1546
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:38,588
it hurts.

1547
01:23:40,087 --> 01:23:40,889
easy victory.

1548
01:23:41,187 --> 01:23:42,889
easy victory.

1549
01:23:42,956 --> 01:23:44,520
-Easy victory -Easy victory

1550
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:46,956
both of them,

1551
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,922
Joining our organization should make you a good assassin.

1552
01:23:50,821 --> 01:23:51,588
Uh...

1553
01:23:52,154 --> 01:23:54,255
They can fight very well.

1554
01:23:56,588 --> 01:23:58,321
Is it okay for you to bleed so much?

1555
01:24:00,088 --> 01:24:02,022
I only eat chicken recently.

1556
01:24:03,187 --> 01:24:04,187
Insufficient hematopoiesis.

1557
01:24:07,588 --> 01:24:09,656
There's going to be an iron party after this time.

1558
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:11,488
Make some pork liver and leeks.

1559
01:24:13,023 --> 01:24:14,520
Okay.

1560
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,321
I promise you.

1561
01:24:17,622 --> 01:24:18,956
You want to make a promise with me?

1562
01:24:20,187 --> 01:24:21,022
Eh...

1563
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:22,321
I promise you.

1564
01:24:31,623 --> 01:24:32,388
hold my hand.

1565
01:24:39,822 --> 01:24:40,656
Those two women,

1566
01:24:41,188 --> 01:24:43,122
It would be good if they joined our gang.

1567
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:45,388
Maybe.

1568
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:49,122
But fighting with them is the best.

1569
01:24:50,788 --> 01:24:51,622
Totally.

1570
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:55,089
Good.

1571
01:24:56,121 --> 01:24:58,187
We will win, we will win.

1572
01:24:59,422 --> 01:25:00,255
will win.

1573
01:25:00,322 --> 01:25:01,123
oh.

1574
01:25:03,154 --> 01:25:04,756
Nansan basketball club gathers.

1575
01:25:06,088 --> 01:25:07,322
What we have is…

1576
01:25:07,489 --> 01:25:08,288
Courage.

1577
01:25:08,454 --> 01:25:09,254
We are…

1578
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,155
strong.

1579
01:25:10,254 --> 01:25:11,122
Facing them...

1580
01:25:11,322 --> 01:25:12,155
We won't lose.

1581
01:25:12,289 --> 01:25:13,522
Ahead is…

1582
01:25:14,521 --> 01:25:15,589
victory.

1583
01:25:17,822 --> 01:25:19,389
This slogan is so stupid.

1584
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:32,556
I'm sorry I broke a lot of promises.

1585
01:25:34,122 --> 01:25:35,422
Why are you bringing it up now?

1586
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:37,390
It's okay.

1587
01:25:39,822 --> 01:25:40,756
you will definitely win,

1588
01:25:42,222 --> 01:25:42,990
I hate you dying.

1589
01:25:45,956 --> 01:25:47,823
Why have you become so weak?

1590
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:51,354
Bet on me.

1591
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:53,790
Chisato Sugimoto.

1592
01:25:58,188 --> 01:25:58,956
You go.

1593
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:01,056
I want to win, Mahiro.

1594
01:26:03,288 --> 01:26:04,756
I will handle it.

1595
01:26:24,323 --> 01:26:25,089
I am leaving.

1596
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:26,856
Um.

1597
01:26:26,989 --> 01:26:27,756
Yeah

1598
01:26:28,255 --> 01:26:29,322
you absolutely have to win.

1599
01:29:40,724 --> 01:29:41,523
I won.

1600
01:29:43,825 --> 01:29:45,825
I won.

1601
01:29:46,858 --> 01:29:47,658
Victory.

1602
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,358
Makoto.

1603
01:29:54,224 --> 01:29:55,025
Ah, it hurts so much.

1604
01:30:46,492 --> 01:30:47,291
Good morning.

1605
01:30:48,792 --> 01:30:49,592
Good morning.

1606
01:32:08,425 --> 01:32:09,226
It's over.

1607
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:16,526
I'm exhausted.

1608
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:24,892
Big brother…

1609
01:32:28,727 --> 01:32:29,526
oh.

1610
01:32:30,292 --> 01:32:31,058
ah.

1611
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,560
oops.

1612
01:32:38,259 --> 01:32:39,459
I was defeated.

1613
01:32:41,493 --> 01:32:43,392
You will win next time.

1614
01:32:50,092 --> 01:32:51,493
But we are the strongest.

1615
01:32:53,127 --> 01:32:53,928
Yes

1616
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:55,993
Thanks for your hard work.

1617
01:32:57,426 --> 01:32:58,259
Thanks for your hard work

1618
01:33:02,027 --> 01:33:02,826
Huh?

1619
01:33:02,893 --> 01:33:03,694
Are you still alive?

1620
01:33:03,794 --> 01:33:04,861
Of course.

1621
01:33:09,326 --> 01:33:10,127
Have fun playing.

1622
01:33:12,726 --> 01:33:13,525
next time.

1623
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:16,426
I will definitely shoot you in the head.

1624
01:33:16,761 --> 01:33:17,662
Try it, idiot.

1625
01:33:19,425 --> 01:33:20,359
Don't call us idiots, idiots.

1626
01:33:27,627 --> 01:33:28,594
Because of you.

1627
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:31,159
We didn't get the chicken steak.

1628
01:33:31,826 --> 01:33:33,594
because of you.

1629
01:33:33,794 --> 01:33:34,761
Makoto,

1630
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,760
I didn’t confess to the clerk.

1631
01:33:36,826 --> 01:33:38,861
That's enough. Don't mention that.

1632
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,459
Ah...it hurts so much.

1633
01:33:40,526 --> 01:33:41,662
Confession cannot go smoothly.

1634
01:33:41,762 --> 01:33:42,662
Why do you say that?

1635
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,693
Dare you say it.

1636
01:33:43,793 --> 01:33:45,126
What a joke.

1637
01:33:49,092 --> 01:33:51,627
That T-shirt of yours is quite cute.

1638
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:53,995
Very cute, right?

1639
01:33:54,294 --> 01:33:57,426
This cat's name is Miyo. Isn't it cute?

1640
01:33:57,493 --> 01:33:59,762
Please be merciful to his complaints.

1641
01:33:59,828 --> 01:34:01,993
I give it cat snacks every day.

1642
01:34:02,594 --> 01:34:03,928
Could it be that you have cat snacks on you?

1643
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,060
Yes, I do.

1644
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:07,092
The tuna flavor is the best.

1645
01:34:07,192 --> 01:34:09,192
what? Chicken breast flavor?

1646
01:34:09,493 --> 01:34:10,794
Have you ever eaten it?

1647
01:34:11,093 --> 01:34:12,762
-It's delicious. -Yes, it's delicious.

1648
01:34:12,828 --> 01:34:14,126
spare me.

1649
01:34:14,694 --> 01:34:16,595
-So disgusting -I recommend the chicken breast flavor.

1650
01:34:17,294 --> 01:34:18,094
Give you tuna taste.

1651
01:34:18,895 --> 01:34:19,927
I also give my brother a taste of tuna.

1652
01:34:20,426 --> 01:34:21,293
Tuna?

1653
01:34:21,393 --> 01:34:22,193
Don't want to eat?

1654
01:34:22,928 --> 01:34:24,094
Do you really want to eat this?

1655
01:34:24,194 --> 01:34:24,962
Eat, eat.

1656
01:34:25,029 --> 01:34:26,526
Want to toast?

1657
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:27,459
Good idea.

1658
01:34:28,595 --> 01:34:30,595
The last supper turned out to be cat snacks,

1659
01:34:30,695 --> 01:34:31,459
Just cat snacks.

1660
01:34:32,226 --> 01:34:33,193
Cheers!

1661
01:34:33,526 --> 01:34:34,294
Cheers!

1662
01:34:35,895 --> 01:34:36,762
Is this really edible?

1663
01:34:37,259 --> 01:34:39,227
Edible, although the taste is a bit bland.

1664
01:34:41,895 --> 01:34:42,728
It sure is tuna.

1665
01:34:43,293 --> 01:34:44,259
So disgusting.

1666
01:34:46,028 --> 01:34:46,795
You try it.

1667
01:34:47,294 --> 01:34:48,161
Really edible.

1668
01:34:48,295 --> 01:34:49,061
Edible.

1669
01:34:49,493 --> 01:34:50,259
Yes!

1670
01:34:51,127 --> 01:34:51,894
It's over.

1671
01:35:05,562 --> 01:35:06,395
Next time,

1672
01:35:07,194 --> 01:35:08,861
I want to live in Hokkaido.

1673
01:35:08,928 --> 01:35:09,894
I don't like hot weather anymore.

1674
01:35:10,028 --> 01:35:11,394
Not bad.

1675
01:35:11,562 --> 01:35:13,495
By the way, I haven’t seen a snow scene yet.

1676
01:35:14,561 --> 01:35:15,894
You two have a good life

1677
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:17,895
No…

1678
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:20,093
Counting Akagi, there are three people.

1679
01:35:21,861 --> 01:35:22,662
Really been waiting.

1680
01:38:02,163 --> 01:38:02,964
It hurts.

1681
01:38:17,195 --> 01:38:18,229
looks so delicious.

1682
01:38:20,463 --> 01:38:21,230
what?

1683
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:23,496
Dumplings.

1684
01:38:23,729 --> 01:38:24,529
you see...

1685
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:27,829
Wow.

1686
01:38:28,729 --> 01:38:29,863
So beautiful.

1687
01:38:31,396 --> 01:38:32,196
what?

1688
01:38:33,528 --> 01:38:34,528
So beautiful.

1689
01:38:34,696 --> 01:38:36,730
What are you doing? Don't steal my "so beautiful"

1690
01:38:36,964 --> 01:38:37,730
That's mine.

1691
01:38:37,964 --> 01:38:38,730
What are you gonna do about it?

1692
01:38:38,864 --> 01:38:39,663
Then I'll steal your "Maison Margiela"

1693
01:38:40,461 --> 01:38:41,564
How's that sound? Don't like it do ya?

1694
01:38:46,162 --> 01:38:46,963
However,

1695
01:38:47,162 --> 01:38:49,597
You can have a handmade dumpling party.

1696
01:38:49,897 --> 01:38:52,195
It seems like this has been done before, right?

1697
01:38:52,796 --> 01:38:53,896
Um.

1698
01:38:54,764 --> 01:38:57,297
I did it once in Junior High.

1699
01:38:58,428 --> 01:38:59,195
Well,

1700
01:38:59,329 --> 01:39:03,663
You're not suited for dextruous work?

1701
01:39:05,095 --> 01:39:07,297
I can totally do it.

1702
01:39:07,897 --> 01:39:09,196
That one seems cheap.

1703
01:39:09,631 --> 01:39:10,429
I want a little,

1704
01:39:11,296 --> 01:39:12,095
Let's look it up.

1705
01:39:12,496 --> 01:39:14,898
Where is my cell phone? Please help me find it.

1706
01:39:15,497 --> 01:39:16,296
Cellphone?

1707
01:39:19,096 --> 01:39:19,897
Huh?

1708
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:22,262
Here it is.

1709
01:39:25,864 --> 01:39:26,631
Thank you.

1710
01:39:27,263 --> 01:39:27,996
It hurts.

1711
01:39:28,863 --> 01:39:30,096
Dumplings?

1712
01:39:30,396 --> 01:39:31,664
What kind should we get?

1713
01:39:32,463 --> 01:39:33,665
Yes.

1714
01:39:37,931 --> 01:39:38,731
Ming Tai...

1715
01:39:39,263 --> 01:39:40,229
1715
Mentaiko cheese...

1716
01:39:40,896 --> 01:39:41,664
1716
Sauerkraut

1717
01:39:42,163 --> 01:39:43,797
1717
That would definitely be delicious.

1718
01:39:43,897 --> 01:39:45,565
1718
Tuna Mayonnaise Dumplings.

1719
01:39:48,296 --> 01:39:49,430
Do you want to include tuna or something?

1720
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:51,231
1720
This will be delicious.

1721
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:52,429
Do you want to wrap the cat snacks in it?

1722
01:39:52,697 --> 01:39:53,529
1722
Why?

1723
01:39:54,564 --> 01:39:55,430
1723
Tuna flavor.

1724
01:39:57,064 --> 01:39:57,898
Uh...

1725
01:39:58,730 --> 01:39:59,529
Ah

1726
01:40:00,096 --> 01:40:00,897
you see.

1727
01:40:01,196 --> 01:40:02,230
1727
This is absolutely delicious.

1728
01:40:02,598 --> 01:40:03,865
1728
Wow looks so delicious.

1729
01:40:04,764 --> 01:40:07,096
1729
- Great. - Is this too burnt?

1730
01:40:07,196 --> 01:40:10,131
1730
Burnt can be tasty.

1731
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:11,362
Dumplings are also good.

1732
01:40:11,564 --> 01:40:13,430
You can eat it after blanching it.

1733
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:14,263
1733
What is this?

1734
01:40:14,363 --> 01:40:15,831
1734
By the way, that skin.

1735
01:40:16,396 --> 01:40:19,665
Don't do this or this.

1736
01:40:19,665 --> 01:40:21,531
Don’t want wrinkled dumplings.

1737
01:40:22,529 --> 01:40:23,931
I want to make something like this,

1738
01:40:24,096 --> 01:40:26,898
Dumplings flattened around.

1739
01:40:28,697 --> 01:40:31,831
Just like this and this.

1740
01:40:32,363 --> 01:40:33,798
I don't like those kind of dumplings.

1741
01:40:34,431 --> 01:40:36,797
1741
I want the kind that make your heart race.

1742
01:40:38,998 --> 01:40:39,831
Haven't you eaten it?

1743
01:40:39,998 --> 01:40:40,797
1743
Just as you told me.

1744
01:40:40,931 --> 01:40:43,263
Just like the king of Osaka and the king of dumplings.

1745
01:40:43,698 --> 01:40:45,032
1745
Finally it will be squeezed like this.

1746
01:40:47,429 --> 01:40:48,530
1746
- Just as you told me - Yeah

1747
01:40:48,897 --> 01:40:49,765
1747
Good.

1748
01:41:01,698 --> 01:41:03,398
This? Are you talking about this?
