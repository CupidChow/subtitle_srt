1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The third season of TuiLiBa

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The unknown mystery is full of TuiShi

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The players will experience five different lives

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Explore five TuiShi locations

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Each location is 40 hours of real-time exploration

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
To solve the TuiShi puzzle

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Each time you explore the case

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Six players will be divided into TuiTan

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The suspect and the real murderer

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The real murderer's task is to hide himself

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Not discovered by other players

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Only the real murderer can lie

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please note that there are X tests this season

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The real murderer passed the test

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can choose one of the TuiTan players

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To turn him into X

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
After X turns black

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Join the real murderer camp

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In the next exploration process

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Try to help the real murderer escape

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
After the exploration is over

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The players will vote for the real murderer

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If the real murderer's number of votes is lower than the other suspects

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The real murderer and X will get the gold key

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Otherwise, the other players who escape will get the gold key

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Are you ready?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Welcome to TuiShi

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Welcome to TuiShi

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Welcome to TuiShi

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Season 3 is waiting for you

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We are new tenants who just moved in

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In the 11th apartment

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We will be neighbors in the future

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Take care of it

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Bai Song, Yi Guo Zhou

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Liu Yike, Guo Jingyu

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Because we are a family

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What is this?

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We are now in the house of the little beast

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The little beast escaped

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The evil spirit and the evil king

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are coming to kill you

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's going on?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It exploded

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why did it explode?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't panic

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you remember your task?

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where are we?

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What are we going to do?

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do we have any task?

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your task is to find a very important person

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This person is very dangerous

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Did we see that person just now?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The man in black

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It must be the man in black who didn't catch up

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's him

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You came here to solve him

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Solve the trouble he caused

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I didn't expect him to be exposed to the amnesia

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Your task failed

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But it doesn't matter, there is still a chance

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Didn't you find a place related to him?

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He has appeared in other places

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can let you go to those places through the sound of the bell

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Be sure to stop him

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The evil spirit and the evil king

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The evil spirit and the evil king

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The evil king

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The evil king

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The evil king

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The evil king

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The evil king

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's killing

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's killing

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's killing

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's killing

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's killing

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Boss

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Boss

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Who will pay the salary if the boss dies?

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Go get the spoon

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He is cooking

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He is cooking

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Jin's spoon

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Spoon

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Spoon

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Jin's spoon

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Coming

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm coming

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Come

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Come here, spoon

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He is dead

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Is he dead?

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm going to determine the murderer

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are like this

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are like this

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Now the boss is dead

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This morning

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Ning Denghao and Bai Hanzi

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We just came back

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So we are not suspicious

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The third season of The Uncanny Counter is officially open

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now is 2025

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
February 25, 8.20

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The victim Han Quan

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
After the initial investigation

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The murderer who killed him is locked in

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Bafen Tang

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Jin Tangshou

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He Ni Ba

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He Ankan

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Among four people

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ning Denghao and Bai Hanzi

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because they have been together

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They have no evidence

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Completely rule out the suspect

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you are the detectives of this case

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now please detect

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Now please judge

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The suspect is beginning to search for evidence

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's talk about

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The relationship between the dead and himself

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
First of all, I am Tangguo factory

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Everyone knows that I am the electrician here

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This morning

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I went out with Bai Hanzi to pick up the goods

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Just came back

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am the star of this factory

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Han Gong

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Although it's not long to come to the factory

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's not long

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But because of the excellent business level

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I am very appreciated by the boss

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am also an employee and an employee

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Not familiar with

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Not too many contacts

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Very simple

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He came here to be a security guard

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I came here to guard his safety

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You work here

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Then he died here

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can vote

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's not that simple

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's not that simple, okay?

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes, just now

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There was a suspicious person

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Run over and found the body

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Then he didn't stop her

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I stopped her

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I took out the electric pole at the first time

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Did you find it?

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That person is not from our factory

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So suspicious

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He just

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But you

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was in the security room

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You were in front of him

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I was just pushing

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I was pushing

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You should have stopped him

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have tried my best

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I took out my electric pole

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Right?

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come on, Xiao Jin

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hello, everyone

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I am Jin Tang Shao

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can make a whole meal of seafood with one shrimp

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This skill

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I entered this network factory

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I entered three months ago

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Wait a minute, why do you say that?

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's fake

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My name is Ba Fen Tang

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I am 20 years old today

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I am the candy packer of this candy factory

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Then I and the boss

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's just an ordinary hire-to-use relationship

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
My name is Henny Ba

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And then it's my boss

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
An ordinary employee

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So far, all four of you are suspicious

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
First of all, let's check this body

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Mobile phone

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It looks like

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There is a password

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There is a password

193
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The password is Ba Ba Ba Ba

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Really?

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You are suspicious

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It says Ba Ba Ba Ba on it

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's right

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What is it?

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Is it a message from someone else?

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's right

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Boss An Wen Zhe

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
At 7.59 in the morning

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Fan Xi said

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why can't you contact me?

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I can only send you a message

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I have arrived

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I asked him to come here

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is that the one just now?

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Kill someone

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The one in black is Boss An Wen Zhe

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Boss An Wen Zhe

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's very likely that it's his boss

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There is a video

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Put it down

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A man in black

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The process of the case

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why is there a camera here?

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes, he recorded himself

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He is not coming down

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What is he doing?

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is he recording a vlog?

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There is time

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
At 7.00 in the morning on February 25

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What are you doing at 7.00 in the morning?

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What are you doing?

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What am I doing? I'm having breakfast

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What am I doing?

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was eating at 7.00

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What were you doing at 7.00 in the morning?

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was giving breakfast

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
OK, what about you?

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was eating at 7.00

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They all said they were eating

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:51,900
Fucking

238
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,900
Nothing

239
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
Something

240
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,000
Who are all singing?

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Tell me

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,420
Did she have

243
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,860
One hammer

244
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,500
So your guess is

245
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,380
He didn't die when he was lying here

246
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,180
Yes

247
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,380
He was beaten to death

248
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,180
Yes

249
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,460
So let's get the body first, OK?

250
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,260
Yes

251
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,340
All are translators

252
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,580
Security guard, work

253
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,500
Yes

254
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,540
Perform well

255
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,340
Take off your shoes

256
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,420
Why do you always

257
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,340
Always command others to work

258
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,180
Because I am a noble detective

259
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,940
There is a key

260
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,140
It says 141 on this key

261
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,420
Whose room is 141

262
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,780
I don't know

263
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,100
It's okay, keep the key

264
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,900
Take it

265
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,340
Your work

266
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,220
No, just a key

267
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,020
Why is there a black cloth

268
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,660
Isn't this a cloak

269
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,100
It's the one in the video

270
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,060
The one in the video

271
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,500
He left his clothes here

272
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,180
Yes

273
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,300
Who threw the most convenient thing there

274
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,380
You

275
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,660
I am a detective

276
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,620
I just provide a possibility

277
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,340
Let's find it out

278
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,860
The assessment score of this place

279
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,260
This is the zero light bulb

280
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,020
You are only 2400 per month

281
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,100
Why is the lowest in the whole factory

282
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,420
I am a delivery worker

283
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,420
And I only work for two days a week

284
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,500
I am a delivery worker

285
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,820
I only work for two days a week

286
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,860
8600 per week

287
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,260
I am 6400

288
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,060
Look at 7000

289
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,940
You

290
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,620
What

291
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,100
Your work is so little

292
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,060
But so high

293
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,180
It's so hard

294
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,300
I'm here every day

295
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,460
You can't even catch a black shadow

296
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,420
And 7000

297
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,220
What's hard

298
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:41,900
Nothing

299
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
You're standing there

300
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,700
The air is dry

301
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,500
He is

302
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,980
Is it drying

303
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,100
Wait a minute

304
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,620
There's a corpse under me

305
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,980
I'm the security

306
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,580
Another one

307
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Wait, we must move

308
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,740
I can't see

309
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,820
Hold you

310
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
Hold you

311
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,900
Are you all right

312
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,580
It's OK

313
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,700
Hurry up

314
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,380
No. 2

315
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,780
Wait

316
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,580
You are more scary

317
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,460
Really?

318
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Where is he?

319
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,180
He is gone

320
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
Where is he?

321
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,620
There is a woman who is screaming

322
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,700
Later she found out that it was him

323
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
I said we were crazy together

324
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,180
Brother Ning has become bolder

325
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,860
I have no fear

326
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,900
No fear

327
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,620
Yes

328
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,460
He has become a big brother now

329
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,620
He is protecting us

330
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,860
So you are protecting us

331
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,540
Yes

332
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,940
I want to follow

333
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,220
So handsome

334
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,100
I want to follow your super-handsome

335
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,580
OK

336
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,460
Give me a sign

337
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,660
Why are there these?

338
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,020
There are some ghosts

339
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,220
Just now

340
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,860
The boss should not be a good person

341
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,260
I thought we were singing in a wrong way

342
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,380
There are some problems in our factory

343
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,940
What's the Policeman dog doing?

344
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,980
Let's check

345
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,860
the workforce

346
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,620
of these suspects

347
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,900
Please don't call us like that

348
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,500
I am the most

349
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,540
murderer

350
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,700
Let's search for the entrances of guards

351
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,500
OK

352
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,180
Guard's room

353
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,740
Here is a computer, right?

354
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,260
Isn't there a computer for you?

355
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,420
I am checking out the monitor

356
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,540
The monitor is supposed to be your watch

357
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,980
Let's have a look at the computer

358
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,900
The door is locked.

359
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,660
There is a door in the living room of the car room.

360
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
The car room.

361
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,860
Over there.

362
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,060
We work every day.

363
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,620
We have to wash our faces in the living room.

364
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,020
Yes.

365
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
The person who ran out just now

366
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,780
is called An Wenzhe.

367
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,580
Is he the owner?

368
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,300
He entered the door first.

369
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,300
After entering, he went to 8.06.

370
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,500
He broke the door when he entered.

371
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,140
That's why he entered.

372
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,540
Yes.

373
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,940
He ran out.

374
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,780
8.09.

375
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,260
So now the door is broken.

376
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,900
We don't need to wash our faces.

377
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,580
We can open it now.

378
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,100
Yes.

379
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,540
No.

380
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,740
What are you doing in the security guard?

381
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,740
You can't see this person entering and exiting, right?

382
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,420
We have to search carefully.

383
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,020
This is my work position.

384
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,220
Yes.

385
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,140
This is your work position.

386
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,780
It's so heavy.

387
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,020
This is so heavy.

388
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,900
These two are so heavy.

389

Do some deliveries

447
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,960
Or go to the supermarket

448
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,360
Zhang Lang

449
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,240
What does this mean

450
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,640
Why is there so many cockroaches

451
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,520

That means

458
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,080
That means

459
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,360
Our candy factory

460
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
There is a food safety problem

461
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,080

This is also often encountered, right

470
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,280
What is this

471
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,400
Someone is teasing me

472
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,720
Who is teasing you

473
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,040
There is more

474
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,640
What did I do wrong

475
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,520
I'm going to be bullied again

476
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
You are so beautiful

477
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,360
I know

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Will you be targeted if you are so beautiful

00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,720
No

480
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,760
Then you usually sit opposite to him

481
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
You

482
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,240
I haven't seen it

483
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,440
Never seen

484
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,640
Never seen

485
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
I can't even see this

486
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,280
I really haven't seen it

487
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
You two are so close

488
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,120
In the middle of the hallway

489
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880

He is the only one in my eyes

493
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,120
I see

494
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,480
Even if Zhang Lang is full

495
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,800
You still can't move your eyes

496
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,160
And he still has yellow hair

497
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,120
Zhang Lang is more obvious

498
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,440
Like a hair clip

499
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,280
He must think that I am full every day

500
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,040
Are some special hair clips

501
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,800
There is clothes

Who was the first

510
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,840
Who was the first

511
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,960
Very simple

512
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,680
Very simple

513
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,640
I developed

514
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,920
What does this number mean?

515
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,720
450

516
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,440
Is it the sound of screaming?

517
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,760
You didn't exceed 450

518
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,720
This is a car room for sugar

519
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,600
What does this mean?

520
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,040
Why are there so many cockroaches?

521
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,080
This is a car room for sugar

522
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,800
What is this?

523
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
There are more

524
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,600
Was it just

525
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,480
Did this 450 rise?

526
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,880
Really?

527
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,400
Yes

528
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,360
It will rise when it is hit once

529
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,560
Really?

530
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,440
How is that possible?

531
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Try again

532
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Come on, spray me once

533
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,800
Stand closer

534
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,200
Really?

535
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,400
Is it possible?

536
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
450

537
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,080
You can find it

538
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,200
Really?

539
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,320
Right?

540
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,440
So the boss has a B?!

This boss is so Branded

544
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,560
It's so weird.

545
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,400
Only the boss can control the score.

546
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,520
But the boss is dead.

547
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,120
Let's find some other clues.

548
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,840
OK.

549
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,880
What other clues?

550
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,640
You can find them.

551
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,280
Look at the shelves.

552
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,160
You are tall.

553
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,920
Quite ponieważ.

554
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,640
From inside.

555
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Wait, this belongs to you.

556
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,120
But, I still remember that...

557
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,560
This...

558
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,440
Don't tell me it belongs to you.

559
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,080
I'm bleeding

560
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,920
You are the brightest star in my heart

561
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,680

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,120
Ke'an Kan

566
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,640
This

567
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,200
Every time I see you

568
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,040
I can wash away my fatigue

569
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,200

Not me

586
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,520
Ke'an Kan, whose gift are you giving?

587
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,600
I don't know either

588
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,400
Let's talk about these two first

589
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,080
Let's talk about these two first

590
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,800
What's going on?

591
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,480
I'm a fan of the ten thousand people

592
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,920
You are all chasing me

593
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,160
Today should be some

594
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,560
Three-point chain

595
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,720
Strange things

596
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm in the eight-point line

597
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,960
What are you?

598
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,880
There are only a few men in the line

599
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,040
Ke'an Kan

600
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,120
White man

601
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,960
This story is not about you anymore

602
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,320
Why does my heart hurt?

603
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,840
You may just be one of the few

604
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
So these two men

605
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,120
All like you

606
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,440
And this one

607
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,280
And this one

608
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,040
What are you giving?

609
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,640
You just talk

610
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,800
There is no practical action at all

611
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,200
Two people give things

612
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,120
You don't do anything

613
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,920
You are a liar

614
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,400
Come on

615
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,960
Actually, he has done some

616
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,440
Some sweet actions

617
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Like the two of them

618
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,480
This kind of earthy gift

619
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,560
It's like the two of us are earthy

620
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,840
He will put this net

621
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,240
Turn this net

622
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
like this

623
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,800
So after he turns it over

624
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,480
He will write some words on it

625
00:27:46,480 --> 00:28:01,620
Or draw some little

626
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,800
Pretty

627
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,320
Is not that said

628
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
the activity is happening

629
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,060
Dygmatic

630
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:38,580
She wants to make some

631
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,380
Dalai Lama

632
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,820
She doesn't love you

633
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,260
Wait, what's this?

634
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,060
Handcuffs

635
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,500
The first episode of the Tui TV weekly

636
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,700
The popular anchor, Sister Dating

637
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,700
is in the spotlight of the public

638
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,260
Who is this person?

639
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,260
Sister Dating is an anchor

640
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,340
I know

641
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:11,900
Not me

642
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,500
It's like I didn't say it

643
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,020
This is my sister

644
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,260
She is your sister

645
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,820
Yes, she is my sister

646
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,620
Her name is Quan Tang

647
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,940
We support each other to grow up

648
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,100
My sister is also beautiful

649
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,300
and her accent is also very good

650
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,980
So she became an anchor

651
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,140
and made a lot of money

652
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,660
and then she

653
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,700
Brought goods, right?

654
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,380
Yes, brought goods

655
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:39,980
Brought goods to the anchor

656
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,420
and then she made a lot of money

657
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,620
and then she drifted away

658
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,820
and then she started her own business

659
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,140
and made a factory

660
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,660
and made that

661
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,060
Tangxing mooncake

662
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,740
Yes

663
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,660
But

664
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,660
Although she is my sister

665
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,100
I have to say that she has no conscience

666
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,980
Because after making more and more money

667
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,660
she wanted to say that

668
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,100
she could make the most money

669
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,540
with the lowest cost

670
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,900
So she used some

671
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,060
not so good ingredients

672
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,820
to make this Tangxing mooncake

673
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,220
Then some consumers complained

674
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,100
So she was

675
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,940
sentenced to jail

676
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,860
She was in jail for three years

677
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,940
and she was out of jail

678
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,700
She was out of jail

679
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,100
Yes

680
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,420
But because she was in jail for a while

681
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,300
she was a little mentally ill

682
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,220
This is a photo

683
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,820
What's going on?

684
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,820
Report

685
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
The boss is behind

686
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,140
The boss is behind her

687
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,780
What does this mean?

688
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,580
This is a reporter

689
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,860
This is not my sister

690
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,500
This is a reporter

691
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:38,940
Yes

692
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,780
This is a reporter

693
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,940
He was interviewing the mental hospital

694
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,460
the mental hospital

695
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,100
Then this is our boss behind

696
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,260
Why did he show up here?

697
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,740
Why do I have this photo?

698
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,380
Why?

699
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,420
I just said that my sister

700
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,500
is a little mentally ill

701
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Then her situation

702
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,260
has actually improved slowly

703
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,700
But at this time

704
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,820
there was a bad news

705
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,180
that she jumped off the building

706
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,020
My sister jumped off the building

707
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,180
Your sister jumped off the building

708
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,940
Yes

709
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,180
Yes, my sister is dead

710
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,100
She jumped off the building

711
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,260
But because she jumped off the building

712
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,580
I think it's very suspicious

713
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,260
Then I got the screenshot

714
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,420
Then I got this screenshot

715
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,740
and saw the boss

716
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,100
Then I recognized him

717
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,140
He is my sister's brother

718
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,820
So your purpose of coming here

719
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,780
is to investigate

720
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,380
Yes

721
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,060
So this is

722
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,060
Because he is my sister's brother

723
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,860
So at that time

724
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,780
he also gave my sister

725
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,620
a mail

726
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,540
and the address is this candy factory

727
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,980
Then I found it here

728
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,900
I have been here

729
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,540
I can see it secretly

730
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,740
The boss lost the password

731
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,100
So you know

732
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,340
the password of the boss's office, right?

733
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,940
Yes

734
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,540
Then I got his password

735
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,540
I went into his office

736
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,380
and found that he was hiding

737
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,780
the magazine and bracelet of my sister

738
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,340
And the bracelet was broken

739
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,860
So my idea is

740
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,060
whether he

741
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,300
was pushing my sister down the building

742
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,660
and pulled my sister's bracelet

743
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,020
between the push and the sound

744
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,860
Then I went to his platform

745
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,580
to see his bamboo leaves and so on

746
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,420
He would send some

747
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,780
like a luxury car

748
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,420
or something like that

749
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:38,940
Bamboo leaves

750
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,820
something like that

751
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,100
and some beautiful

752
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,580
some beautiful videos

753
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,940
Some kind of pervert, I feel

754
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,300
So he was here

755
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,020
to give him a whole

756
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,900
is to be a live broadcast

757
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,100
to be a live broadcast

758
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,420
to give him a whole reward

759
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,020
It's possible

760
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,140
Then all of us

761
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,460
have this score

762
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,740
Are all of us being broadcasted?

763
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,260
Yes

764
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,660
OK

765
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,300
Then the next place

766
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,740
Go

767
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,100
Next

768
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,100
Then we should go to the male dormitory

769
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,060
OK, go

770
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,860
Come on, the living area

771
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,620
The dormitory of the male dormitory

772
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,900
Who's the first one to go to the dormitory?

773
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,100
The male dormitory

774
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,420
This is the dormitory of the fierce man

775
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,420
The dormitory of the fierce man

776
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,220
My dormitory

777
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
Search the security first

778
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,020
Wait a minute

779
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,580
You stand at the door first

780
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:58,860
Why?

781
00:33:59,420 --> 00:33:59,980
Li Xian

782
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,660
OK

783
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,820
There are games on the wall

784
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,580
Tell me

785
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,660
I have a dream since I was a child

786
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,980
to be a game master

787
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,860
I want to play a professional game

788
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,900
OK, play a professional game

789
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,860
But my grandma

790
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,540
always thinks

791
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,700
you can't make your life

792
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,020
a practical one

793
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,420
by playing games

794
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,740
Yes, there is a future for security

795
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,660
Teacher

796
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,380
How can you say that?

797
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,180
Maybe the old people like

798
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,780
to be at ease and have no worries

799
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,620
But I tell you

800
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,460
I am a newcomer

801
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,700
I am a telecommuter now

802
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,420
I tell you

803
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,140
When people are five or six years old

804
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,700
the ultimate goal is to be a security guard

805
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,620
So you have walked less than 30 years

806
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,740
You are now a security guard

807
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,420
Brother Xun, you'd rather tell me this

808
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,100
Yes

809
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,460
What's going on?

810
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,260
The sword is broken

811
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,780
This is the bed for security, right?

812
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,340
Yes

813
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,260
Come on, let's take a look

814
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,220
and see his bed

815
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,820
Sleep me

816
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,540
Why is he so

817
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,460
Sleep me

818
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,820
What sleep?

819
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,420
Sleep me

820
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
Sleep me

821
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,420
Sleep

822
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,180
Let me

823
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,940
Explosive

824
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,740
Why did you let us do this job?

825
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,100
I have to

826
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,500
Sleep

827
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,740
Sleep

828
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,860
Hit people

829
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,780
I'm afraid there is something to break the bone

830
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,340
Absolutely

831
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,540
There is a score machine

832
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,940
Sleep

833
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,540
Will sleep work?

834
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,700
It's not that simple

835
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,980
You hurry up

836
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,380
You have to imitate

837
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,060
the lines of this hero

838
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,300
The sword of the great river rises

839
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,060
The sword of the great river rises

840
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,340
There is a secret passage

841
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,180
Push in

842
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,100
The score is increased

843
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,940
Finally, I did the job I should do

844
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,660
I'm not going out now

845
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,540
Hurry up

846
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,660
The bug is inside

847
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,700
What is it?

848
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,780
Is this his picture?

849
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,380
So handsome

850
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,140
This fresh man

851
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,780
What's this?

852
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,420
You tell me what's going on first

853
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,260
What's going on?

854
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,340
What's going on?

855
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,900
This is a space that I accidentally found

856
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,860
How did you find it?

857
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,780
I put a lot of this on the wall

858
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,820
The hero I like to play

859
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,980
I usually lie here

860
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,500
I like to copy their lines

861
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,540
One day when I was shouting

862
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,340
Suddenly he triggered this machine

863
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,300
I just got in

864
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,820
This is his phone

865
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,180
There are some videos

866
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,620
Didn't you come up a while ago

867
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,140
to watch the movie Nezha?

868
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,460
The big brother is ready

869
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,780
What posture are you talking about?

870
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,980
The big brother burns the fire with his eyes

871
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,020
The big brother burns the fire with his eyes

872
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,140
I wait for the dry laugh to be full

873
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,980
You are so great

874
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,340
I can't go back to the cinema

875
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,580
You do one

876
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,300
You do one

877
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:16,900
Yu Jieying

878
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,300
Too bad

879
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,380
You have nothing

880
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,500
You make it

881
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,500
All right

882
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,660
What's this friends

883
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,940
The game sharing group

884
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,500
Come on guys

885
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,980
Share good things

886
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,060
Super transport

887
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:36,860
move the fishes

888
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,820
Yes

889
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,460
Five four three two one

890
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,860
What's the play of Go Yu Jieying

891
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,420
It's Y vershy

892
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,260
Pretending to trip

893
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,420
Watch your exes

894
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,060
Tip Nice

895
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,940
No

896
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,340
Dada

897
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,940
Fighting

898
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,420
Bro

899
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,580
sitting

900
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,420
The following group says

901
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,620
Do you have new skin recently?

902
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,420
The client said

903
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,540
I just moved out

904
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,300
I'll show you my big baby

905
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,260
What big baby should I show people?

906
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,860
Skin

907
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Hello, this is

908
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,180
NZL e-sports club

909
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,500
You have the qualification to be a NZL reserve player

910
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,860
After the review

911
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,100
You will have a final interview with your video call

912
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,300
If the video is not connected

913
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,540
You will be considered to give up this opportunity

914
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,700
The received account is

915
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,420
I am

916
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,740
King of the wild

917
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,980
King of the wild

918
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,180
King of the wild

919
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,660
Secret agreement

920
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,460
Secret agreement

921
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,700
Read it

922
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,740
The client of the client

923
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,660
The client of the client

924
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,740
The client of the client

925
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,660
The client of the client

926
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,260
Secret agreement of the client

927
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,500
The client must not leak

928
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,140
Any information within the framework

929
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,180
More than that, it is not allowed to do

930
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,580
All the sales activities in the factory work area

931
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,700
Otherwise, it will be considered a commercial leak

932
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,540
Need to compensate the company for one million

933
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,220
He is one million

934
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,020
Did you make a mistake?

935
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,580
Why did you make this one million mistake?

936
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,900
This is the case

937
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,620
Our staff here

938
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,500
Don't allow to bring cell phones

939
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,100
The club replied to me

940
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,820
He wants to give me a video call

941
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
So I secretly

942
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,300
When I was on duty

943
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,420
Brought my phone

944
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,900
You are a security

945
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,660
No wonder he can come in

946
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,260
Business business

947
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,180
Work and fish

948
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,220
At that time, the boss

949
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,020
He thought I was shooting a video

950
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,260
But actually I was with my club

951
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,620
Video call

952
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,020
I also passed their interview assessment

953
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
Yes, but he has a condition

954
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,420
That is to say, you want to come to me

955
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,580
This club is working

956
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,860
You can't be a player

957
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,020
There is no personal legal dispute

958
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,140
So you just hurt the boss

959
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Because you owe him one million

960
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,780
That's right

961
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,180
How?

962
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,060
There is a motive

963
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,220
You are one for money

964
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,460
Two is for your dream

965
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,260
You have to do this

966
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,060
Yes

967
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,420
Right?

968
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,100
Yes

969
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,820
You know what I should do

970
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,580
Do you agree

971
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,900
I should do this

972
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,620
OK

973
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,580
OK

974
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,740
Let's search

975
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,060
Henny 8

976
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,460
I want to ask what this is

977
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,020
This is mine

978
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,940
This week's target is 5 times 99

979
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,540
What does it mean?

980
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,060
Red gym

981
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,260
You can only do 99

982
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,660
You can't do five rounds less

983
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,060
There is a technique

984
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,060
There is a technique on it

985
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,580
There is a technique on it

986
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,420
There is a technique on it

987
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,180
There is a technique on it

988
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,020
There is a technique on it

989
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,420
Can you do it?

990
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,020
You don't think I'm so energetic

991
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,660
Hurry up

992
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,540
Yes, squat down

993
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,420
It's flying

994
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,140
Can you do it?

995
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,820
Yes

996
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,180
Hurry up

997
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,660
Yes

998
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,140
You passed

999
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,700
You passed one and then you passed

1000
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,300
Really? Who said that?

1001
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:01,780
Really

1002
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,340
Yes

1003
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,260
Then come again

1004
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,620
You are so good

1005
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,500
Great

1006
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,700
You see, there are some young people

1007
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,980
You see, there are some people

1008
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,340
So great

1009
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,820
Security is security

1010
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,660
It's really extraordinary

1011
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,540
Sit down

1012
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:26,900
Hurry up

1013
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,300
You sit here

1014
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,980
I sit two

1015
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,700
I'm a Han Gong

1016
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,540
My arms can't be too tired

1017
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,180
Why can't Han Gong's arms be tired?

1018
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,100
I'm a technical worker

1019
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,180
But why can security's arms be tired?

1020
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,220
Because you have to exercise your arms

1021
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,460
OK

1022
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,180
That's it

1023
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:39,820
Great

1024
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,140
It has a sense of rhythm

1025
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,780
Fly up

1026
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,140
You have to fly up

1027
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,740
So fierce

1028
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,740
You feel like a motorcycle

1029
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,060
You are like this

1030
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,580
Wait

1031
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,460
I'm so tired

1032
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,460
You have a sense of rhythm

1033
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,820
The faster you go, the more I will encourage you

1034
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,980
So strong

1035
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,660
So powerful

1036
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,740
Yuning

1037
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,260
You are really the best

1038
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,540
OK

1039
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,220
99

1040
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,980
Crazy love

1041
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,180
So good

1042
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,700
The light

1043
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,420
Just to know that you like him

1044
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,140
It turns out that we are busy

1045
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,820
And he gave us his confession

1046
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,140
Hot and beautiful

1047
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,980
8 points sugar

1048
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,900
Always passionate

1049
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,340
The evening breeze brings your smile

1050
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,220
So cute

1051
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,740
One in a million hearts

1052
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,260
Are in your pupils

1053
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,420
What?

1054
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,420
So cute

1055
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,620
So cute

1056
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,740
I tell you

1057
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,260
This man is so unreliable

1058
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,100
Use this broken purple box

1059
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,540
Start messing with our girl

1060
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,020
No

1061
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,700
Some people eat this

1062
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,860
Some people don't eat this

1063
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,860
You have to look at people

1064
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,580
OK

1065
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,020
Do you eat this?

1066
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,580
Do you eat?

1067
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,900
I don't eat anyone's set

1068
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,580
What?

1069
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,340
I eat

1070
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,740
I eat

1071
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,260
I want to eat

1072
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,060
Look at the phone

1073
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,420
Labor contract

1074
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,340
Why are you afraid of my labor contract?

1075
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,780
He is afraid of my labor contract

1076
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,820
He helped you with the contract

1077
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,660
Labor

1078
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,020
Did he help you with the contract?

1079
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,660
There is also a order order

1080
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,540
The supply unit is a factory

1081
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,700
Factory

1082
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,540
Factory is the boss

1083
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,380
The sugar he sells

1084
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,180
It's not the sugar we produce

1085
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,100
It's from a factory

1086
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,140
Ordered a batch of sugar

1087
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,060
Sold to the consumer

1088
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,300
Packed into a jade bath

1089
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,340
Because once I found

1090
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,100
There is a very suspicious person outside

1091
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,180
Not our factory staff

1092
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,140
But he is transporting our goods

1093
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,860
Packed our sugar

1094
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,820
Separated the packaging and sugar

1095
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,700
Transfer the sugar back to the factory

1096
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,980
Package paper came to me

1097
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,660
Let me pack it again

1098
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,620
So this sugar and packaging paper

1099
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,300
Has been used repeatedly

1100
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,500
Our factory is actually

1101
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,340
Fake operation

1102
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,700
The factory is doing fake accounts

1103
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,980
I was so angry

1104
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,060
Tear this thing

1105
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,620
I found out

1106
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,060
The paper box I was sitting on

1107
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,260
It has a layer

1108
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,860
Inside is the box of Tangxin mooncakes

1109
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,460
So Tangxin mooncakes

1110
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,820
At that time, when Sister Dating was live streaming

1111
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,180
The mooncakes that came out at that time

1112
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,460
It was made by this boss

1113
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,820
It's worn

1114
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,340
Yes

1115
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,500
So it's not your sister's fault

1116
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,300
Don't you know what this is?

1117
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,140
You've been investigating the boss for so long

1118
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,300
You don't know Tangxin mooncakes

1119
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,140
I don't know

1120
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,100
Your sister is in a bad mood

1121
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:13,860
Yes

1122
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,740
Three years ago, I quit school to start a business

1123
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,820
I looked for a job that suited me

1124
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,820
I found out that Sister Dating was live streaming

1125
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,540
Then I saw her Tangxin mooncakes

1126
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,380
Selling very well

1127
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,860
I bought a lot

1128
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,820
As a result, I just bought a lot of mooncakes

1129
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,980
Tangxin mooncakes were found to be poisonous mooncakes

1130
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,300
You like to eat so much

1131
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,220
Or do you want to sell it?

1132
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:36,940
I want to sell it

1133
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,100
Then I went in

1134
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,540
Then I bought mooncakes

1135
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,980
I can't sell it anymore

1136
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,060
I lost so much money

1137
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,780
So you threaten her with this

1138
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,020
Want the boss to give you money

1139
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:47,580
What?

1140
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,460
No

1141
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,420
Not yet

1142
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,100
Yes

1143
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,340
Is there any more?

1144
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,540
It's from her doll

1145
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,340
Found out

1146
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,020
The fire department

1147
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,300
The fire department has three work places

1148
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,180
Did someone tell her?

1149
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,220
He Nipa, let me tell you

1150
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,460
Don't think you can't just hide

1151
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,060
Don't pay back

1152
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,420
Our patience has been exhausted by you

1153
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,660
Three months, can you pay it back?

1154
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,540
Ten days, if you don't pay it back

1155
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,580
That's the secret power

1156
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,660
This is called a high-performance belt company

1157
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,580
Then I can't pay back the high-performance belt

1158
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,700
I was forced to come to the factory to work

1159
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,620
Many little sisters like me very much

1160
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,380
But I only like her

1161
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,020
I send her muscle photos every day

1162
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,140
And my dance videos

1163
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,100
So cruel, send muscle photos

1164
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,020
Yes, so she owes money outside

1165
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,620
She found out the company's secret

1166
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,420
Threaten the boss with secrets

1167
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,460
Fraud

1168
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,620
I threaten the boss is the truth

1169
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,980
But I threaten the boss to save her

1170
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,300
Not because of me

1171
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,940
Don't you want money?

1172
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,860
By the way, I want a sum of money

1173
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,380
You want money and you want to save people

1174
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,700
You are so greedy

1175
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,700
Do you want to have money and love?

1176
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,820
Money and love

1177
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,420
If I don't have money

1178
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,420
How can I raise her?

1179
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,060
Did you get your money?

1180
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,140
No

1181
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,980
She died

1182
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,820
So you killed her

1183
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,380
I didn't get my money

1184
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,380
Why should I kill her?

1185
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,300
Nausea

1186
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,700
There is an iPad here

1187
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,660
So handsome

1188
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,020
Why am I shocked by your handsome again and again?

1189
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,060
Let's take a look at WeChat

1190
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,700
8-point sugar

1191
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,820
He sent 8-point sugar

1192
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,180
What is this?

1193
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,660
B-boy

1194
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,700
Let me see

1195
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,060
No, this is him

1196
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,500
Yes

1197
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,140
This is me

1198
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,820
B-boy

1199
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,740
This is you

1200
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,020
This is me

1201
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,780
This is me

1202
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,700
This is me

1203
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,740
This is me

1204
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,740
This is me

1205
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,700
This is me

1206
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,700
This is a dance video that I am proud of

1207
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,300
This is a dance video that I am proud of

1208
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,180
It's not like this

1209
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,140
This is what I sent to my fan

1210
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,100
Why do you look at it?

1211
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,020
You don't deserve to see

1212
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,780
We are learning from you now

1213
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,460
How to chase girls

1214
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,300
No

1215
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,300
I want to

1216
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,700
Did you notice his details?

1217
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,860
Oh my god

1218
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,620
Oh my god

1219
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,140
Let's do this

1220
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,060
The five of us will stand in a row

1221
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,780
And then we dance together

1222
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,980
Let her see the front

1223
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,820
First, you must be cold-faced

1224
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,740
Secondly

1225
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,420
Secondly, you have to close your mouth

1226
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,060
You look cool at the end

1227
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:48,660
You have to get off the stage

1228
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,380
Right

1229
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,940
It's still cool

1230
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,660
Come on

1231
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,300
1 2 3 4

1232
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,660
Five, six, seven, eight

1233
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,140
The last one

1234
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,140
This one

1235
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:04,820
Yes

1236
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,940
Come on, three, two, one

1237
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,100
OK

1238
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,580
I killed it

1239
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,260
I killed it

1240
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,060
Is it over?

1241
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,780
He sent this to

1242
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,540
Use dance to test love, right?

1243
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,620
Confirmed the comment

1244
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,260
The comment praised me

1245
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,020
He said it was weird here

1246
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,100
How about we quit together

1247
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,900
Leave this one

1248
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,100
I advise you to talk to others in the future

1249
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:26,700
Just talk well

1250
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,900
Don't post videos, OK?

1251
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,380
He is more aggressive, look

1252
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,620
Then Bafun Tang said

1253
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,820
You can support me if you don't work

1254
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,860
I can't leave here

1255
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,300
You should stay with me

1256
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,860
I can't leave you either

1257
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,060
Did I say that?

1258
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,340
Which year is this?

1259
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,220
This year

1260
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,860
What else is in it?

What does it mean?

1273
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,260
What is this?

1274
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,100
Play gambling

1275
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:16,820
He buys vegetables today

00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,660
Play gambling

1277
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:18,260
Gambling

1278
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,420
Although I am a

1279
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,340
A construction worker

1280
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,820
But I am

1281
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,220
I am the only one in our factory

1282
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,940
A graduate from Tui Zhen University

1283
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,900
And I usually

1284
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,220
Take some people in the factory

1285
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,660
To make some investments

1286
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,100
This investment, this investment

1287
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,740
I will operate these things

1288
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,540
In the year of 1990

1289
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,940
I became a

1290
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,180
A gambler

1291
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,460
A small banker

1292
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,980
You are a banker

1293
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,460
You

00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,780
It's not easy

1295
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,020
I am a helper

1296
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,260
I collected a little bit of profit from it

1297
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,540
There are muscle photos

1298
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,260
January 12, 2025

1299
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,580
Bafun Tang said to Henny first

1300
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,580
Hello, Henny

1301
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,060
I am the sweetest guy in Bafun Tang factory

1302
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:58,700

00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,020
Then January 25, 2025

1305
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,060
At 18 o'clock

1306
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,900
Henny, you look so handsome

1307
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,660
With your single-hand manhunt

1308
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,660
Your skill of playing the second-hand manhunt

1309
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,780
Has become more powerful

1310
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,740
Then I must like it more

1311
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,140
Then he went to practice

1312
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,380
Oh my god

1313
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,560
husbands

1314
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,700
Next

1315
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,180
Ke'an, look

1316
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,940
You are a capitalist

1317
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,740
You think so

1318
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,260
If you don't move, I will say sit here

1319
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,620
No, stop playing

1320
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,060
Go sit

1321
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,820
Ke'an asked Han Bywa

1322
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,460
terrible

1323
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,020
Li Xiaozi is far away from Bafun Tang

1324
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,540
She is my favorite Trans happily

1325
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,300
Stop hitting

1326
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,100
I don't think you can beat me with a few muscles

1327
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,940
You can practice

1328
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,860
Did you send this?

1329
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,100
Did you send this to the security?

1330
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,060
I don't remember this

1331
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,500
You don't remember this

1332
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,940
You beat me, you don't remember

1333
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,100
I remember you beat me

1334
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,100
But it's because of this

1335
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,940
You don't remember

1336
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,300
No

1337
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,380
You don't know if you're done

1338
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,340
No

1339
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,780
You two fought for me

1340
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,940
You don't remember

1341
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,420
No

1342
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,140
You don't remember

1343
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,180
You listen to me

1344
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,020
Why did you fight

1345
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,180
Because of this

1346
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,820
Because of this

1347
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,860
Wait a minute

1348
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,620
Wait a minute

1349
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,660
Wait a minute

1350
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,540
I was beaten by him

1351
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,660
Don't use such a cool expression

1352
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,860
Say such a vulgar words, okay?

1353
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,660
I was beaten by him

1354
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,260
Because we have always been

1355
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,020
It's also quite easy

1356
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,140
Never crossed the line

1357
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,620
Afu phone

1358
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,860
Why don't you participate in this duel

1359
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,340
You also sent me that

1360
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,820
I don't know why he beat me that day

1361
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,500
I think he's sick

1362
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,620
I'll find him to practice another day

1363
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,300
I mean that

1364
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,060
He means he doesn't know the message

1365
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:03,740
Yes

1366
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,660
Do you have a lot of people

1367
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,260
Don't know you've sent these messages

1368
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,500
I know

1369
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,540
No, do you know you sent it

1370
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,700
But you don't remember

1371
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,420
You said this to him

1372
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,260
I don't remember

1373
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,220
That is, there is one

1374
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,700
Can someone log in our account

1375
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,660
Send message

1376
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:22,940
Yes

1377
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,100
Do you have this doubt now

1378
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,500
Yes

1379
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:24,900
OK

1380
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,340
Yes

1381
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,220
What is your motive for killing

1382
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,740
You ask me

1383
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,580
What is the motive for killing a good person

1384
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,340
Your voice is broken

1385
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,100
What's wrong with you

1386
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,220
He's in the murderous mood

1387
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,340
Now I understand

1388
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,060
He has accumulated 500,000

1389
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,580
This high-end belt

1390
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,740
Let him suffer

1391
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,700
It's this Tangxi mooncake

1392
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,620
The boss of Tangxi mooncake

1393
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,740
I didn't suffer

1394
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,940
There are still many little girls

1395
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,340
Like me every day

1396
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,500
Why do I suffer

1397
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,180
Your happiness is so simple

1398
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,740
Yes, every day there are girls who like it

1399
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,380
There are girls who dance at home every day

1400
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,620
So easy

1401
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,140
OK

1402
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,260
It's nice to break in every day

1403
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,740
Then it may be that I was hurt by him

1404
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:03,860
He was hurt

1405
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,260
Go out

1406
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,020
Big brother

1407
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,700
Big brother is practicing dancing in the corridor

1408
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,500
Dad gave me two

1409
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,020
He said

1410
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,900
No, he may have a headset

1411
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,660
Walk forward

1412
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,060
like this

1413
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,620
Yes

1414
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,180
No, it's just a move

1415
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,300
Then

1416
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,540
OK, it's also a way

1417
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,580
So cruel

1418
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,580
Then your motive for killing

1419
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,140
Is to save him

1420
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,500
Then kill that

1421
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,980
No, I don't love him that much

1422
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,900
OK

1423
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,180
His happiness is simple

1424
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,340
Anyway, there are many little girls who like him

1425
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,300
Not one less

1426
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,900
Yes

1427
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,620
No, he hates this boss himself

1428
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,980
Because this is the front body

1429
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,340
Yes

1430
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,260
Let him become like this for a lifetime

1431
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,220
Yes, a lifetime

1432
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,020
Destroy the lower body

1433
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,780
OK

1434
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,780
Actually, they all have

1435
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,420
They all have

1436
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,660
Take it away

1437
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:51,940
It's too late

1438
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,060
I don't eat anyone's set

1439
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,540
OK, the next point to collect

1440
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,580
Is our

1441
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,260
Kitchen where the heart sugar is boiled

1442
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:12,900
This is the market

1443
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,740
This is your place

1444
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:14,620
Yes

1445
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,780
Everyone can go around

1446
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,940
Why is your kitchen not warm at all?

1447
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,780
You can't have bro

1448
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,780
Apply some makeup

1449
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
Son email

1450
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,940
I buy a jackpot

1451
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,860
Or give love

1452
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,720
Give love

1453
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,460
Brother, let's eat noodles

1454
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,340
quickly

1455
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,780
Wait a minute, I'll heat it for you

1456
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,820
There is a secret passage

1457
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,300
Where did you get this?

1458
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,060
I sneaked out

1459
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,780
and killed someone

1460
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,700
and stole it back from here

1461
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,180
I need to explain the delivery port

1462
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,140
We have a non-military operation room

1463
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,780
That's where we can't go

1464
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,740
There are employees there

1465
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,220
I have to cook for them every day

1466
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,060
So I put their food

1467
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,180
in this

1468
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,020
and sent it over

1469
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,860
Have you been there?

1470
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,020
Have you sent yourself in?

1471
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,100
Occasionally

1472
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,180
and then returned

1473
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,380
Because he has a military

1474
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,780
There should be a lock at the door in front

1475
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,900
Now how to open this door

1476
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,500
I'll try

1477
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,140
Be careful

1478
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,780
No

1479
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,620
Locked

1480
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,700
It's locked outside

1481
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,260
Is there a possibility

1482
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,660
that the door will open after closing it?

1483
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,540
It's possible. Let's try

1484
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,380
Wait a minute

1485
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,060
Wait a minute

1486
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,580
No

1487
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,460
Push it up

1488
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,460
Push it up

1489
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,220
I can't. You do it

1490
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,300
What if

1491
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,300
I can't climb up. It's too high

1492
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,020
You guys do it

1493
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:56,780
OK

1494
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,300
Come on

1495
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:57,940
Close the door

1496
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:01,980
Is it open?

1497
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,300
Is it open?

1498
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,580
Is it open?

1499
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,260
It can't be opened

1500
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,700
It can't be opened

1501
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:15,860
Look up

1502
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,180
Try it all up and down

1503
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,060
It's useless

1504
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,380
It must be something to trigger the mechanism

1505
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,340
It must be something to trigger the mechanism

1506
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,060
I put their food in this

1507
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,380
Put a bowl of rice in it

1508
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,900
Put a bowl of rice in it

1509
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,580
Put a bowl of rice in it

1510
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,700
You take a bowl

1511
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,580
Are you OK?

1512
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,380
Take it

1513
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,300
Such a silly behavior

1514
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,300
Let someone do it

1515
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,860
It's useless to put rice in it

1516
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,140
There must be a mechanism

1517
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,460
There is no mechanism

1518
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,340
What mechanism?

1519
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:51,940
Well, let's

1520
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,340
Let's take a walk around, OK?

1521
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,220
OK

1522
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:04,940
This garbage bag

1523
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,660
This garbage bag is so big

1524
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,260
What's wrong with the garbage bag?

1525
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,460
Then you can put a person in it

1526
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,140
You can put a person in it

1527
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,180
I'll see if I can take it away

1528
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,980
After you finish it

1529
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,300
remember to help me restore it

1530
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,380
We're about to quit

1531
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,580
We can restore it for you

1532
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,460
I found it

1533
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,060
What?

1534
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,580
What's that?

1535
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,020
What's this?

1536
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,900
That tape recorder

1537
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,580
It's not me

1538
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,580
It's not me

1539
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,340
It's all done by him

1540
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,940
Talking to bold

1541
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,100
So beautiful

1542
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,940
Talk with bold

1543
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,380
Talk with bold

1544
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,460
Talk with bold

1545
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:57,940
Right

1546
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,420
Hey, something is wrong

1547
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,620
Who is talking to bold?

1548
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,340
Talk to bold

1549
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,940
That manages interesting activities

1550
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,620
Take this

1551
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,140
This

1552
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,260
Use this

1553
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,060
No

1554
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:14,540
OK

1555
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,060
Isn't it

1556
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,660
Be bold

1557
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:31,660
What's this?

1558
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,060
There's something inside

1559
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,060
Where are you from?

1560
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:42,860
Boss Tan's

1561
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:44,740
Why are you here?

1562
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,260
I'm a thief

1563
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,060
What's the password?

1564
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:49,540
I don't know

1565
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,140
I can't open this box

1566
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,580
It's out

1567
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,980
Whose room is 141?

1568
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,500
There's a key

1569
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,300
It says 141 on this key

1570
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,340
Sorry

1571
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:09,540
Key

1572
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,060
Key

1573
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,500
Is this a key?

1574
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:13,940
Yes

1575
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,100
It's open

1576
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,740
But this phone is not mine

1577
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:24,940
This is the boss's phone

1578
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:25,460
Yes

1579
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,900
He has the boss's ID card

1580
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,260
I'll bring you the food

1581
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,460
You analyze

1582
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,580
I'll bring you the food

1583
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,900
This is your lunch

1584
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,740
I made it for you

1585
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,500
Full of sweat and full of joy

1586
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:54,900
OK

1587
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,420
Let me tell you first

1588
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,420
This box

1589
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,580
I found it in Boss Tan's office

1590
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:04,100
I sneaked in and picked it up

1591
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,140
There's a special plant in this box

1592
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,540
It's called rock-tongue tree

1593
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,620
The special plant in this box is called rock-tongue tree

1594
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,500
The rock-tongue tree looks like purple

1595
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,700
It's a poisonous substance

1596
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,260
If you eat a small amount of rock-tongue tree

1597
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,860
you will often see the symptoms of bleeding

1598
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,460
and green blood

1599
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,900
If you eat too much

1600
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,660
you need to take effective treatment in time

1601
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,220
Otherwise, you will be in danger of life

1602
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,940
This is a kind of food

1603
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,740
Maybe some people don't know what it is

1604
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:43,860
But when I say something

1605
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,180
you will remember what it is

1606
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,340
It's our star moon cake

1607
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,460
Poisonous substance

1608
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:48,900
Yes

1609
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,940
Why was the star moon cake poisoned?

1610
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,940
I've been investigating

1611
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:55,660
Later I found that

1612
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,660
the star moon cake

1613
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,420
was fried with this substance

1614
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,380
Food

1615
01:02:59,380 --> 01:02:59,940
Yes

1616
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,060
It's like purple

1617
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,540
What is this?

1618
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,740
This is in our canteen

1619
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,180
I'm responsible for

1620
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,380
everything you eat

1621
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,860
So no one can misunderstand

1622
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,900
anything bad

1623
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,980
But one day

1624
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,660
my dear Bai Hanzi

1625
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,780
my dear Bai Hanzi

1626
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,660
was actually

1627
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,860
picking the food

1628
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,500
I found that

1629
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,700
he was poisoned by this

1630
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,100
Poisonous substance

1631
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,780
Yes

1632
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,420
But I know how the poison of the rock-tongue tree

1633
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,060
is solved

1634
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,940
I immediately made juice and soup for him

1635
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:33,780
He couldn't drink it

1636
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,100
I said don't be afraid

1637
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,220
The little plane is coming

1638
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,500
Then he was like

1639
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,700
The little plane is coming

1640
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,060
The little plane is coming

1641
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:40,940
Yes

1642
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,340
He drank it all

1643
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,540
I poured two bowls of it

1644
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,220
Then it's done

1645
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:46,780
From now on

1646
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:47,620
I think he should

1647
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,420
have some feelings for me

1648
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,620
Yes

1649
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,820
There is a phone

1650
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:54,900
Let's take a look at this phone first

1651
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,380
Bai Hanzi

1652
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,580
Can you come over and see Bai Hanzi?

1653
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,340
What are you doing?

1654
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,180
Bai Hanzi, you are confessing to me

1655
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,580
You sent a message to the golden spoon

1656
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,540
You said that my golden spoon

1657
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,540
has some problems with my welding gun recently

1658
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,380
I can't change the iron

1659
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,020
He asked you why

1660
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:06,660
You said

1661
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,620
Because I just want to see you together

1662
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,020
Why do you say that?

1663
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:12,980
You don't like me

1664
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,700
Bai Hanzi continued to send him

1665
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,980
My biggest dream in this life

1666
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,220
is to become the soup spoon in your hand

1667
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,020
I can see you every morning

1668
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,620
You guys

1669
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,860
There are only a few men in the factory

1670
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,460
Who do you love?

1671
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,540
I said

1672
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,900
There are two screenshots of chat records in this phone

1673
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,900
This is the boss's phone

1674
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,460
This is the screenshot of August 29, 2022

1675
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,140
Boss Han and an iron man's chat record

1676
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,020
I don't know about this

1677
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,100
Because I can't open this box

1678
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,860
The first screenshot

1679
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,700
Boss Han said

1680
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,260
Three months ago, the new mooncake sample

1681
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,100
of the new video factory

1682
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,620
My father-in-law was sick

1683
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,340
I just found out that

1684
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,340
the new cheap raw material

1685
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,820
is glutinous and sour

1686
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,500
and poisonous

1687
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,260
I used this material

1688
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,380
to produce a batch of

1689
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,820
Tangxing Tangguo

1690
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,860
I can't sell it now

1691
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:04,660
I am depressed

1692
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,220
Boss Han said

1693
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,260
Bro, you must help me

1694
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,220
with our relationship

1695
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,820
I have to find a way to escape

1696
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,820
I want to change the company's legal person

1697
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,300
to the partner of the goods I bring

1698
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,300
My sister

1699
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,420
She used some

1700
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,460
not so good ingredients

1701
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,300
to betray into prison

1702
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,060
Anyway, the goods she received

1703
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:23,860
were all sold by her

1704
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,540
I will send the goods as usual

1705
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,780
The one who received the goods and ate something

1706
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,660
is also her

1707
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,300
Then she issued a full-time ID card

1708
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:30,860
and turned it over

1709
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,140
The earlier the better

1710
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,180
The earlier the better

1711
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,660
Give me another half of the fake ID card

1712
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,500
So this is

1713
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,660
Boss Tan's original name

1714
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,460
is Tan Dada

1715
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,180
She killed Sister Seren

1716
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,860
Boss Tan's original name

1717
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,700
is Tan Dada

1718
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,060
It's not me

1719
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,860
It's all done by Tan Dada

1720
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,100
The one who received the goods and ate something

1721
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:58,940
is also her

1722
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,100
She killed Sister Seren

1723
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,100
Is it your sister's voice?

1724
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,500
Yes, it's my sister

1725
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,500
Yes, it's your sister's voice

1726
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,100
I can hear it

1727
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:08,860
I have watched her live broadcast

1728
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:10,980
Brother Fang Er

1729
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,020
Yes, Brother Fang Er

1730
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,700
So this person went to find her

1731
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,500
to seek revenge

1732
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:17,820
Then she

1733
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:18,500
I went to find her

1734
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:19,980
You went to find her

1735
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,620
Who did you find?

1736
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:23,740
Wait, what's the story?

1737
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,820
Because of the Tang Xin moon cake

1738
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,020
I've been investigating

1739
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:27,580
Why do you investigate?

1740
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,300
Why do you investigate?

1741
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,220
It's the moon cake

1742
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,300
What's your identity?

1743
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:35,980
What does it have to do with you?

1744
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,700
No matter what my identity is

1745
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:41,980
as a citizen

1746
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,380
if I'm a consumer

1747
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,460
if I'm fooled

1748
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,980
I'll go to the police

1749
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:49,820
You can call the police

1750
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,420
Why do you want to find her?

1751
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,660
You can report it

1752
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,140
Yes

1753
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,140
No, isn't she in jail?

1754
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,460
But she betrayed for three years

1755
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,260
and released it again

1756
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,100
I wore my black dress

1757
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,660
and sneaked into the hospital

1758
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,900
I said, Quan Teng, tell me

1759
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,180
why?

1760
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,340
So it's you

1761
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,580
No

1762
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:12,380
No

1763
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,260
You pinched her face like this, right?

1764
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:14,900
Why?

1765
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:15,660
She said

1766
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,780
it's not me

1767
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,460
You go to find Tan Dadan

1768
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,660
So you know it's Tan Dadan

1769
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:21,980
Yes

1770
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,340
No, I don't think it's that simple

1771
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,580
You are out of place

1772
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,460
and you can't go to the high-performance team

1773
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:38,540
Sorry

1774
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,980
it's time for me to go

1775
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:40,780
You can go

1776
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,740
He west

1777
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:47,540
He west

1778
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,300
Besides, there are tres choices

1779
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,380
Three, two, one

1780
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,020
we go either

1781
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:52,980
or

1782
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,300
Have you been fooled by people?

1783
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,140
Two zero

1784
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,140
There's a problem

1785
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:03,060
There's a number on it

1786
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,980
Two zero zero five six seven

1787
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,780
Is it the production date?

1788
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,780
Look at the table

1789
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,500
Tui Tu Village welfare home

1790
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,700
You are the Miss Tang of the welfare home

1791
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,860
I'm an orphan too

1792
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,660
And then?

1793
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,860
I grew up in Tui Tu Village welfare home

1794
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,820
We have no money in this welfare home

1795
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,140
So we all eat very little

1796
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,220
When I grew up, I thought

1797
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,060
I must use the least ingredients

1798
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,340
to make the most delicious food

1799
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,020
I can make a whole shrimp

1800
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:49,180
with a shrimp

1801
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,620
Then I worked in this welfare home

1802
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,580
Everyone likes it

1803
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,100
I like those kids too

1804
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,900
Especially one kid

1805
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:58,060
His name is Little steamed bun

1806
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:59,980
He loves my steamed buns the most

1807
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,020
He is also very picky

1808
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,100
He can't eat enough

1809
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:02,940
One year

1810
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,140
I said this year is Mid-Autumn Festival

1811
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,380
Sister asked the welfare home

1812
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,180
I asked for some money

1813
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:07,980
I asked for some budget

1814
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:08,940
I bought you moon cakes

1815
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,340
I was shooting 988 on the live broadcast

1816
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,620
Shooting 988

1817
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,380
Yes

1818
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,540
So there is a kid

1819
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:19,620
who eats that poisonous moon cake

1820
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,100
Yes

1821
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,220
Then your three-person thing is this

1822
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:23,660
It's established

1823
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,380
Because I bought Tang Xin moon cake

1824
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:26,700
and let the kid be poisoned

1825
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,140
Now the most important thing is

1826
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:34,860
What are you playing?

1827
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,540
What are you doing for a while?

1828
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:38,980
Except for two detectives

1829
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,540
Can ask me a question

1830
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,580
No one

1831
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,020
No one wants to ask me

1832
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,740
Is there a big master of the stars?

1833
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,700
I think the problem is still

1834
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,900
on those two men

1835
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,180
I'll give you an accurate list

1836
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:58,060
The time line in the morning

1837
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,180
I'm the same at six fifty

1838
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,820
We both get up at the same time

1839
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,780
Then I go to the toilet at six fifty five

1840
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:07,940
I washed

1841
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,740
I washed for about three minutes

1842
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,180
Out of the toilet

1843
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,100
I saw He Nibai

1844
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,500
He was going in at that time

1845
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,300
I just finished

1846
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:15,900
He was going in

1847
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,380
You saw him go to the toilet

1848
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,020
Yes, that's right

1849
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,700
I saw him go to the toilet

1850
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,980
He came back to the dormitory at seven ten

1851
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:22,700
OK

1852
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,860
He came back to the dormitory

1853
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:24,900
OK

1854
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,940
Six fifty seven

1855
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,860
I'm giving you breakfast

1856
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,300
I'll go back to my room after I'm done

1857
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,060
Rest

1858
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:32,900
My time is

1859
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,700
Get up at six fifty

1860
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,660
Then at six fifty seven

1861
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:37,660
The soup spoon

1862
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,820
Knock the door to send breakfast

1863
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,660
Then at seven fifteen

1864
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,740
I had breakfast

1865
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,940
Go to the toilet to wash

1866
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,940
At seven thirty

1867
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,620
I went back to my room

1868
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,420
That

1869
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:50,860
I

1870
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,300
The video we took in the car

1871
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,900
How many o'clock was the hammer?

1872
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,020
Seven o'clock

1873
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,340
The process of the crime

1874
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,140
Seven o'clock

1875
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,300
That is, five hundred and seven

1876
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,500
Five hundred and eight

1877
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,420
Someone came over at seven

1878
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,220
The time of the crime is only two to three minutes

1879
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,140
Two minutes

1880
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,340
Kill someone

1881
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,020
Three minutes

1882
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:12,940
Actually, he's already passed out

1883
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,700
Don't you think

1884
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,260
He just went over

1885
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,500
Take a hammer at this time

1886
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,660
Give him a fatal blow

1887
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,540
Then just run away

1888
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:20,660
Yes, that's it

1889
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:21,500
Actually, that's it

1890
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,100
The murderous motive

1891
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:26,980
First of all, this

1892
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,500
The four of you have this

1893
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,820
The motive to kill

1894
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,140
Yes

1895
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,220
The motive to kill Ba Zengtang

1896
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,020
Because he suspected that

1897
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,260
Tan Qian boss killed his sister

1898
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,340
He wants to avenge his sister

1899
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,260
This is your motive to kill

1900
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,260
Revenge

1901
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,180
What about Huo Xinyi

1902
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,660
Huo Ni

1903
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:47,220
Huo Xinyi

1904
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,900
Huo Xinyi

1905
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,380
Huo Ni

1906
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,460
Because he knew some secrets of the boss

1907
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,620
Wanted to ask him for money

1908
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,300
But he didn't give it

1909
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,300
Instead, he killed people for money

1910
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,460
Revenge

1911
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,820
Then our case

1912
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,580
Is to have a new dream

1913
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:03,380
Then follow the video

1914
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:05,100
As a result, he was found by the boss

1915
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,100
Asked for one million with him

1916
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:06,820
As a result, because of this contract

1917
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,180
He can't fulfill his dream

1918
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,260
Can't join the club

1919
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,500
So it's possible to kill him

1920
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,260
A thousand yuan

1921
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:11,660
Yes

1922
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,540
Jin Jiangchao's friend

1923
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:16,020
Because he used to live in the kindergarten

1924
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:16,660
Then a little friend

1925
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,100
Because he ate a mooncake

1926
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:18,540
He was poisoned

1927
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,140
So he has to find out the truth

1928
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:20,420
Yes

1929
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,660
He is too thick

1930
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:22,140
This is him

1931
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,460
OK

1932
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,460
What is our question now

1933
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,820
How to open the door of the delivery booth

1934
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,580
There should be a lock at the front door

1935
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,860
There must be a mechanism

1936
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,300
No

1937
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,820
No, this color above

1938
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,980
There is also

1939
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:39,780
There is a password

1940
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,140
Yes

1941
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,420
What happened here

1942
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,980
What is it for you to deliver things

1943
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,220
Not me

1944
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,660
Whose are you giving to

1945
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,060
I don't know

1946
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,300
My life is wonderful because of you

1947
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,180
Look

1948
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,140
What is this

1949
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,300
Did you send it to the customer

1950
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,300
I don't remember this

1951
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,140
Ba Fengtang said

1952
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,300
You feed me if you don't work

1953
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,380
I can't leave here

1954
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:59,580
I can't leave either

1955
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,900
Leave you

1956
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,020
Did I say that

1957
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,260
Yes

1958
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,220
I think he is playing with us

1959
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:11,900
Play

1960
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,900
It's possible that he wants to play with you

1961
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:14,980
Because he likes to make jokes

1962
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,340
If you play, you will get points

1963
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:20,860
Yes

1964
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,700
He may get happy

1965
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,260
He likes to see people like this

1966
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,060
He makes others happy

1967
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,980
Because he likes to watch live broadcasts

1968
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,860
He is my sister's brother

1969
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,300
What is possible

1970
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,740
We are sitting here now

1971
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:39,780
Are all being broadcasted

1972
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,900
There is a possibility

1973
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,460
You think of him

1974
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,940
Believe me when I say

1975
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:01,260
You can see to stay

1976
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,140
You are being compensated

1977
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,060
Someone will reward you online

1978
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,700
You will get money after being rewarded

1979
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,660
The boss is just a

1980
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:06,620
He is a live broadcast

1981
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:07,740
So actually this

1982
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,220
This is a live broadcast industry

1983
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,860
We are not here to make candy

1984
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:11,500
Right

1985
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,500
We are pretending to work in this factory

1986
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,260
Someone is being rewarded

1987
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,220
Now it should be

1988
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,380
Let's try it, OK?

1989
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:22,820
How about this

1990
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:23,900
You two practice now

1991
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,180
See if the money will rise

1992
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,100
Let's do it

1993
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,780
But this is my money

1994
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,740
Then you practice with him

1995
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,260
Then I will play

1996
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,260
Then I will play

1997
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,380
You have to be hit

1998
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,660
I am hit

1999
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,300
Yes, you will get money

2000
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,980
I will get money when I am punished

2001
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,020
Wait a minute

2002
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,740
I think the most torturing thing is

2003
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:50,380
It must be

2004
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,460
He is dancing again in front of me

2005
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:00,700
It's very torturing

2006
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,620
You try it

2007
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,380
Really

2008
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,180
Hurry up

2009
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,020
Look at this score, it should be high

2010
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,300
So sad

2011
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,460
Look at your respect

2012
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:19,820
Look!

2013
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:21,940
You think that it is very shocking

2014
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:22,540
How do you think

2015
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,180
It is just the expression

2016
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:23,900
what

2017
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,100
So let me tell you

2018
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:25,940
How much

2019
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:32,740
Have Angry

2020
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,580
You have no money

2021
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,520
so

2022
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,000
You know me

2023
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,620
you

2024
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:45,320
I didn't

2025
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,240
This thing

2026
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,240
So it should be

2027
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,080
We are being broadcasted

2028
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,400
We are being rewarded

2029
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,040
Next, we will enter the X confirmation section

2030
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,800
There is already an X

2031
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,160
So fast?

2032
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,600
Next, we will enter the X confirmation section

2033
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,080
In this episode

2034
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,120
X's play style has been updated

2035
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,480
As the murderer, the players will face the X's test

2036
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,440
If the murderer player succeeds in the test

2037
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,400
He can choose whether to blackout one

2038
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,360
to be X

2039
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,400
The blackout X will be in the next investigation

2040
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,600
Try to help the murderer escape

2041
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,960
And after X confirms the murderer

2042
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,240
There is only one chance to communicate

2043
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,400
If the murderer's vote is lower than other suspects

2044
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,040
The murderer and X will get the gold key

2045
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,760
On the contrary, the other players who escape

2046
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,760
will get the gold key

2047
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,840
You can choose not to

2048
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,800
If you are X

2049
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,320
Who do you want to be the murderer?

2050
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,720
Who is the partner with you?

2051
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,120
Of course I want to be

2052
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,680
OK

2053
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,600
I tell you, killers

2054
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,680
I am a political detective

2055
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,680
It's no use blackening me

2056
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,680
If you blacken me, I will still

2057
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,280
Be righteous

2058
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,840
Be righteous

2059
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,960
Stand for justice

2060
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,120
Go

2061
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:24,680
Go

2062
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,800
So nervous

2063
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,000
No way

2064
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,240
Why is Bai Han so fast?

2065
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,520
Because he is not X

2066
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,080
I think he is more like X

2067
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:44,720
Didn't you just say

2068
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,040
You want to be a righteous person?

2069
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,320
Yes, it's me

2070
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,520
I think he is X

2071
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,200
I think everyone will tell the truth

2072
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,400
Why are you

2073
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,720
Why are you talking to him

2074
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,600
and then talking about me?

2075
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,120
He has become talkative, hasn't he?

2076
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,520
He has become talkative

2077
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,400
I think it's a little bit

2078
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,600
I think it's a little bit

2079
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,240
I think it's a little bit

2080
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,240
I think it's a little bit

2081
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,440
All right

2082
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,440
Let's get to the voting

2083
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:11,960
Let's get to the voting

2084
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:12,480
me

2085
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:12,920
and Wang Bo

2086
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,800
Let's go

2087
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,680
What's that?

2088
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,680
It's my first time to see three Miss Long

2089
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,760
You guys already know

2090
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,720
So I have been among them

2091
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,860
Yu theta

01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,460
You call I'll run

2093
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,200
Well, now

2094
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:31,960
Well

2095
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,160
I were singing

2096
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:35,880
Help everyone

2097
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,680
Okay

2098
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,200
Help anyone

2099
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,480
What's the password?

2100
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,120
Password.

2101
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,000
Yes, I like it.

2102
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,680
010188.

2103
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,560
Okay.

2104
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,600
I'm speechless.

2105
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,760
What's the use of pointing a knife?

2106
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,800
I'm protecting you.

2107
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,800
What am I doing?

2108
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,120
Okay.

2109
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,760
I'm a little scared when I see this.

2110
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,400
Don't be scared.

2111
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,200
Send.

2112
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,920
Either send or send.

2113
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,760
Send.

2114
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,560
Send.

2115
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,840
Send or send.

2116
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,200
There must be something here.

2117
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,520
The light flashed.

2118
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:15,880
Wait a minute.

2119
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,920
Why is this light really flashing?

2120
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,080
The light flashes.

2121
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,440
It's really scary.

2122
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,760
What are you doing?

2123
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,240
Why is this light not on?

2124
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:30,840
So annoying.

2125
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,400
You're affecting our case, X.

2126
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,600
Okay, yes.

2127
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,560
Open those boxes.

2128
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,240
See if there's anything.

2129
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,600
Okay.

2130
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,640
Did you look at the file carefully?

2131
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,600
I'm looking.

2132
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,640
There's nothing in the file.

2133
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,640
Is it a box?

2134
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,640
No.

2135
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,480
There's another one.

2136
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,840
The regular candy is 5 million.

2137
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,720
The hidden one is 8.8 million.

2138
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,480
The limited candy is 11.5 million.

2139
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,280
The polite fish candy is 200,000.

2140
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,600
Our candy

2141
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,080
is sold for 200,000 in the fake candy.

2142
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:04,640
What does it mean?

2143
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,920
Our candy is sold for free.

2144
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,520
There's a password.

2145
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,760
A card.

2146
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,800
It should be a password.

2147
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,640
Let's try again.

2148
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,960
01088.

2149
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,600
How much is send or send?

2150
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,080
8181.

2151
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,520
No.

2152
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,520
Where's 8888?

2153
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:27,600
No.

2154
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,160
Send or send.

2155
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:30,640
1818.

2156
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,080
0818.

2157
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:33,920
How many are there?

2158
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,880
Are you sure?

2159
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,920
Let me check.

2160
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,840
Wait a minute.

2161
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,120
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2162
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:40,600
8.

2163
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,320
9.

2164
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,120
8.

2165
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,480
8.

2166
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,200
It's a password.

2167
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,560
Where else is the number?

2168
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:46,880
This one.

2169
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:47,760
This form.

2170
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,200
Write it down.

2171
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:49,880
Add it together.

2172
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,480
It should be.

2173
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:51,760
Come on.

2174
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,000
Add it.

2175
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,360
200,000 is 2040.

2176
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:56,880
Right?

2177
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,560
This is...

2178
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:57,800
Right.

2179
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,760
200,000.

2180
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,960
And then,

2181
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,880
5 million.

2182
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,320
5 million.

2183
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:01,880
4 zero.

2184
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,160
4 zero.

2185
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,280
2040.

2186
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,240
Add 500.

2187
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,440
Why can't I press it?

2188
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,240
How about the password?

2189
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,400
What are you doing?

2190
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,320
What are you doing?

2191
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:20,960
Over there.

2192
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,040
Just do the math.

2193
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,440
Just do the math.

2194
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,040
Wait.

2195
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,280
Just do the math.

2196
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,360
What are you doing?

2197
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,320
Right.

2198
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:35,840
1150.

2199
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,640
20 plus 500.

2200
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,840
Plus.

2201
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,680
2550.

2202
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,320
How about the math?

2203
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,280
2550.

2204
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,000
4 zero.

2205
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,640
No money.

2206
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,280
You are awesome.

2207
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,160
You deserve it.

2208
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,920
These are the passwords.

2209
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,400
The number you have dialed is not available.

2210
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,000
The number you have dialed is not available.

2211
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,680
So much money.

2212
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,280
So much money.

2213
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,400
So much money.

2214
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,160
Oh my god.

2215
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:41,760
Wow.

2216
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,240
Yes.

2217
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,960
Backstage income.

2218
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,880
80,000.

2219
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:47,720
Backstage income.

2220
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:48,240
10,000.

2221
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,120
Backstage income.

2222
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:49,720
60,000.

2223
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,200
Backstage income.

2224
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,720
30,000.

2225
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:53,560
Backstage income.

2226
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,080
70,000.

2227
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,680
50,000.

2228
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,520
What is this?

2229
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,440
What does it mean?

2230
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,080
What is this?

2231
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,280
What is this?

2232
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:16,600
Look.

2233
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,320
This is a hot pot.

2234
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:17,840
Look.

2235
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,160
What is this?

2236
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,240
Your traditional bag.

2237
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,160
It has become a hot pot.

2238
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,440
Right.

2239
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,240
So it's a hot pot.

2240
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,800
I said it's smelly.

2241
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,160
No.

2242
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:32,880
It's been...

2243
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,360
It's been trying to conquer you, right?

2244
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:34,880
Yes.

2245
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,160
Look.

2246
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,600
For example, where is this passage?

2247
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,240
I don't know.

2248
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,640
This is our dorm corridor.

2249
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,160
Corridor.

2250
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,320
The dorm is the dungeon.

2251
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,320
After the special effects.

2252
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:45,920
Yes.

2253
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,400
So we thought we were in the dorm.

2254
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,480
In fact, the audience thought we were in the dungeon.

2255
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,120
Here.

2256
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,040
This is the office.

2257
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
What does it become?

2258
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,280
The special effect is made into a beach.

2259
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,120
Beach.

2260
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,120
This is our door.

2261
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,520
You're doing the telecom on the beach.

2262
01:23:59,520 --> 01:23:59,840
Yes.

2263
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,760
My signal.

2264
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,760
Where is my canteen?

2265
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:03,600
Here.

2266
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,680
Is this the canteen?

2267
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:05,720
Kitchen.

2268
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:06,720
Kitchen.

2269
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,800
We were eating in the kitchen.

2270
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,160
Yes.

2271
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,640
There is also a hidden camera.

2272
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,280
A secretly shot angle.

2273
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:13,880
Where is this?

2274
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,840
This is the kitchen.

2275
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:16,880
This is mine.

2276
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,200
This is the door.

2277
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,680
This is a secretly shot angle.

2278
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,880
This is very scary.

2279
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,520
Where is this?

2280
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,360
Is this the living area?

2281
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:25,760
No.

2282
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,840
This is the...

2283
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,600
The hall.

2284
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,800
The corpse should be here.

2285
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,680
The corpse is in this position.

2286
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,160
This way.

2287
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,200
Yes, over there.

2288
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,360
From 6.30 a.m. to 8 a.m.

2289
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,080
The security is closed.

2290
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:38,880
So we guessed that

2291
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,920
the live broadcast

2292
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,000
should be real.

2293
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:41,360
Yes.

2294
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:41,760
Right?

2295
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,280
Reward?

2296
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:42,800
We really...

2297
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,120
Look.

2298
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,200
When we came in just now,

2299
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,000
he said

2300
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,240
why the bill is 40,000 yuan.

2301
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:46,800
It's still a lot.

2302
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,120
If someone gives us a reward,

2303
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,800
the money will be accumulated here.

2304
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:50,360
Yes.

2305
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,440
He used our live broadcast

2306
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,880
to make so much money.

2307
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,360
Yes.

2308
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,480
It's very full.

2309
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,880
The back stage bill is 20,000 yuan.

2310
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,680
The back stage bill is 50,000 yuan.

2311
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,080
The back stage bill is 90,000 yuan.

2312
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,040
The back stage bill is 50,000 yuan.

2313
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,200
It's very full.

2314
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,280
Let's confirm

2315
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,240
whether the real one

2316
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,920
is really this scene,

2317
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,800
OK?

2318
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,280
OK.

2319
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:15,600
OK.

2320
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,680
Then let's do this.

2321
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,320
Take a camera and go.

2322
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,200
That one is happy.

2323
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:18,840
You girls,

2324
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:19,200
the girls,

2325
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,200
let's go, OK?

2326
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:20,840
OK.

2327
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,280
The three of us girls are here.

2328
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:22,840
OK.

2329
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,680
You are a girl today.

2330
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:27,520
Yes, no problem.

2331
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:27,880
OK.

2332
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,720
OK.

2333
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,640
OK, you go.

2334
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,680
OK, it's OK.

2335
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,160
You go.

2336
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,400
Miss Bai.

2337
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:37,560
Miss Bai.

2338
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,160
I want to stay here to protect her.

2339
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,440
What if it gets dark?

2340
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,840
Tell us where we go.

2341
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,000
It seems to be here.

2342
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,560
Come in, come in.

2343
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,080
Come on.

2344
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,560
Lie down.

2345
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,560
Lie down.

2346
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,720
Lie down.

2347
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,560
Will this be the money?

2348
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,720
Sugar.

2349
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,400
Will this be the money?

2350
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,480
In the sugar hot pot.

2351
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:02,520
Forget it.

2352
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,640
Forget it for yourself.

2353
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,560
Forget it.

2354
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,680
Get in the account.

2355
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,240
Yes.

2356
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,400
Please check the account number.

2357
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,720
Three thousand.

2358
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,840
Just lie down like this and you will get it.

2359
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,680
Nothing to do.

2360
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,760
What is this?

2361
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:19,640
That's it.

2362
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,200
So.

2363
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,680
This hidden camera.

2364
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,640
Isn't it taking pictures?

2365
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,560
Can you see it?

2366
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,800
There is a surveillance camera that takes pictures secretly.

2367
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,160
It's probably at the height of your crotch.

2368
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:35,920
It's going to the right.

2369
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:36,560
Right hand side.

2370
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,520
Six o'clock direction.

2371
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,840
No, it's this box.

2372
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,480
This white box.

2373
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,200
Iron box.

2374
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:48,440
Let me do it.

2375
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,680
It's in the white surveillance box

2376
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,880
of the turntable.

2377
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:54,800
The box is.

2378
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,320
The conveyor belt.

2379
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,240
It's the conveyor belt.

2380
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:58,800
Yes.

2381
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,880
It's a reverse camera.

2382
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,840
It's the position of my work.

2383
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:04,200
This is it.

2384
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:04,960
Wait a minute.

2385
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,280
The power is coming, friends.

2386
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,120
Take it apart.

2387
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,080
Take a closer look.

2388
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:12,800
Four.

2389
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,040
It's probably the fourth camera.

2390
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:15,720
Yes.

2391
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,400
Aren't we going to gather the cameras?

2392
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:18,840
Yes, we are going to gather them.

2393
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,000
Where else?

2394
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,960
There is another one.

2395
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:26,720
Let me do it.

2396
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:30,960
So handsome.

2397
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,320
It's like a retro camera.

2398
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:35,920
Yes.

2399
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,120
So beautiful.

2400
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,320
Which one is the surveillance camera?

2401
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:42,920
Where is it?

2402
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,000
It's on your poster.

2403
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,920
It's on the conveyor belt.

2404
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,200
Here.

2405
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,080
Take it out.

2406
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:50,600
Yes.

2407
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,080
There is one on the opposite side.

2408
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,160
The opposite side of the entrance.

2409
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,960
I found it.

2410
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,400
There is one in the vase.

2411
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,080
Yes.

2412
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:01,840
The white surveillance camera is right.

2413
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,240
It's on the opposite side.

2414
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,800
Yes.

2415
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,960
I got it.

2416
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,440
There is another one.

2417
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,200
It might be in this box.

2418
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,160
In the box.

2419
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,480
You block it with that box.

2420
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,560
Move that box away.

2421
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,280
Yes, I got it.

2422
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,160
So handsome.

2423
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:18,840
It's here.

2424
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,520
Your photo in the photo zone

2425
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,080
is not a fake one.

2426
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,120
It's a fake one.

2427
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,840
But I didn't suspect it.

2428
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:26,960
Let me see the camera.

2429
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,360
What is on it?

2430
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,280
There is a number.

2431
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:40,560
Two.

2432
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:43,840
Wu Jun.

2433
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,040
He can't get in now.

2434
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:45,720
There is a password.

2435
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,240
Six.

2436
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,560
Get in the door.

2437
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,240
I don't want to wear them anymore.

2438
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,760
It was very cold.

2439
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,040
It's got a bit cold.

2440
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:05,700
Some

2441
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:06,880
Don't go appreciate the wind こっこ

2442
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,780
All right, there is—

2443
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,040
There is a door part?

2444
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:10,960
You can't go in it now.

2445
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,080
No, it's over there.

2446
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,820
You need to stay there.

2447
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:16,540
You don't have to hide in here.

2448
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:17,280
Please.

2449
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,480
Thanks.

2450
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,680
There's a password plate in front of the door.

2451
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:20,360
Take it

2452
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,600
What a great person

2453
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,880
You are so nice

2454
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,760
Be careful, it's sprayed

2455
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,000
I didn't get sprayed by this

2456
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,200
I was fooled by this

2457
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:39,680
White six

2458
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:40,960
Six

2459
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,760
Three

2460
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,320
Six, three, five, two, four, one

2461
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:51,760
What is this?

2462
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,120
It's this kind of

2463
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,800
It's a conveyor belt

2464
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,680
It's really a conveyor belt

2465
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,240
This is so long

2466
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,120
This channel

2467
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,760
And it keeps rolling forward

2468
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:04,960
It's a running machine

2469
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,200
But how to run?

2470
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,840
Because it keeps moving back

2471
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:08,720
Come on

2472
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,760
Start the first wind

2473
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:13,760
Go

2474
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,160
Oh my god

2475
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,360
Come on

2476
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:23,840
I'm accelerating

2477
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,160
I'm accelerating

2478
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,080
Accelerate

2479
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,480
I'm accelerating

2480
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,320
Accelerate

2481
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,120
Wu Xing, be careful

2482
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,240
I don't know what it is now

2483
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,240
Why didn't you follow any of them?

2484
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:53,600
I feel like

2485
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,520
I'm getting faster

2486
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,400
No way

2487
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,120
Wait a minute

2488
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,000
I think this is too fast

2489
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:00,840
I'll do it

2490
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,960
I'll do it first

2491
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:02,440
Hold it

2492
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,880
Don't get on your head

2493
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:05,640
Go

2494
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:06,200
Slow down

2495
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:06,880
Three, two, one

2496
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,600
This is a little fast

2497
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,600
It's not very friendly for us

2498
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,720
It's a little embarrassing

2499
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,000
It's like a cow

2500
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,600
Go forward

2501
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:29,800
Go forward

2502
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,120
It's a little embarrassing

2503
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,200
It's a little fast

2504
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,480
It's not very friendly for us

2505
01:31:46,480 --> 01:32:14,020
The

2506
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,640
Let's see

2507
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,880
Hurry up, you go first

2508
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,820
Not friendly than us tall When I feel suffocated

2509
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,560
I feel suffocated

2510
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:44,960
Stand up

2511
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,480
Get up first

2512
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,480
Get up

2513
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,480
You go first

2514
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,480
Step on it

2515
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,480
Let me pull

2516
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,480
It's okay

2517
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,480
It's okay

2518
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,480
Come on

2519
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,480
Okay, be careful

2520
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,480
There's no way to help her

2521
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,480
She can do it

2522
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,480
No problem

2523
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,480
Yes, you come over like this

2524
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,480
It's so sour

2525
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:18,480
I can't do it

2526
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:20,480
Last two steps

2527
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,480
Don't

2528
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,480
It's so sour

2529
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,480
Last two steps

2530
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,480
Last two steps

2531
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,480
It's so tiring

2532
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:36,480
What's this?

2533
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,480
I'm going to eat chicken

2534
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,480
Last two steps

2535
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,480
Stand up

2536
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,480
Stand up

2537
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,480
Hold her

2538
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,480
Okay

2539
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,480
We escaped from heaven

2540
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,480
We can go out

2541
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,480
So tired

2542
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,480
I'm really going to vomit

2543
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,480
I'm going to vomit

2544
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,480
If someone climbs up

2545
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,480
The factory will alert you

2546
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,480
As long as you climb up

2547
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,480
Everyone will know

2548
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,480
Okay

2549
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,480
It means it's a one-way

2550
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,480
Okay

2551
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,480
She can only climb up like this

2552
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,480
Can't climb up like this

2553
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,480
No, this is the first one

2554
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,480
The second one

2555
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,480
If someone climbs up

2556
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,480
Like us just now

2557
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,480
It will lead to the speed error

2558
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,480
You can't climb up, you can go

2559
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,480
You lie on it

2560
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,480
Yes

2561
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:16,480
Send it out

2562
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,480
It doesn't climb up, it's transported

2563
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,480
It's the pressure

2564
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,480
So the point you just said

2565
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,480
Climbing up will be like this

2566
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,480
If you don't climb up, there will be no sound

2567
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,480
So you can send the body

2568
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,480
Yes

2569
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,480
Take the reference

2570
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,480
Is it here? Take the reference

2571
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,480
There is a secret passage

2572
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,480
This is the reference

2573
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,480
We have a military operation room

2574
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,480
That's where we can't go

2575
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,480
I put their food in this

2576
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,480
Is it open?

2577
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,480
Can't open

2578
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,480
I think this is a secret passage

2579
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,480
Yes, it is a secret passage

2580
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:48,480
Of course

2581
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,480
This door is

2582
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,480
It's out

2583
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,480
The car can go out

2584
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,480
There is a car

2585
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,480
It's a car

2586
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,480
It's a car

2587
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:10,480
It's a car

2588
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,480
It's a car

2589
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,480
It's a car

2590
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,480
It's a car

2591
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,480
It's a car

2592
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,480
This is the one you said, the candy

2593
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,480
This is the one you saw

2594
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,480
The one for the goods, right?

2595
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,480
Yes

2596
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:21,480
There is a very suspicious person outside

2597
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,480
Not our team's staff

2598
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,480
But he is transporting our goods

2599
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,480
Our factory is actually operating in fake

2600
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,480
There is a push-pull machine

2601
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:41,480
Can the door be opened?

2602
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,480
Locked

2603
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,480
Nothing

2604
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,480
Let's go

2605
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:50,480
Let's go

2606
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,480
Wait a minute

2607
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,480
There is a prison

2608
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,480
You can go up here

2609
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,480
It's fingerprint

2610
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:02,480
Yes, fingerprint

2611
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,480
The fish is in the delivery room at a fixed time

2612
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,480
Take it out in person

2613
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,480
And then send it to the second floor

2614
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,480
Transfer the corpse of Boss Tan

2615
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,480
Use his fingerprints to unlock

2616
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:24,480
Yes

2617
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,480
Move

2618
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,480
Just go here

2619
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,480
Come on, sit here

2620
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,480
Where are you?

2621
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,480
I feel like this is a very good movie

2622
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,480
I want to take a photo for you

2623
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:52,480
Where are you?

2624
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,480
Come on, come here

2625
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,480
Where are you?

2626
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,480
Help

2627
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,480
Wait a minute, don't worry

2628
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,480
We have to think about it

2629
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,480
Don't shout

2630
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,480
What?

2631
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,480
Wait a minute

2632
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,480
We have to think about it

2633
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,480
Where are you?

2634
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,480
Help

2635
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,480
Help

2636
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,480
Help

2637
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,480
You want to destroy the evidence, right?

2638
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,480
I moved the corpse from there

2639
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:17,480
Destroy the evidence

2640
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,480
Where did you come from?

2641
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,480
I'm in the kitchen

2642
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,480
You little killer

2643
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:22,480
You have two questions

2644
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,480
Little killer

2645
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,480
Why are you still talking about it?

2646
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,480
Yes, we are thinking

2647
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,480
What a good thinking process

2648
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,480
What's going on?

2649
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,480
Yes

2650
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,480
Right?

2651
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,480
You have to treat yourself as a corpse

2652
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,480
To feel this process

2653
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,480
You can know the last

2654
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,480
How did this killer

2655
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,660
go to the crime scene of the

2656
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:41,480
water-sucking

2657
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,480
Sin

2658
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:43,480
Maybe it was killed outside

2659
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:47,480
Move it, carry it

2660
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:48,480
Come on, one leg per person

2661
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,480
Come on

2662
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,480
It's too hard, really

2663
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,480
My hand

2664
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,480
It's so dark

2665
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,480
Is this a tunnel?

2666
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,480
This is a prison

2667
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,480
It's your sister

2668
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:18,480
I'm scared

2669
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,480
Is she dead?

2670
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,480
She's not dead

2671
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,480
I'm getting goosebumps

2672
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,480
I'm observing you

2673
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,480
Everyone

2674
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:34,480
The police have to limit us

2675
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,480
to the maximum

2676
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,480
The police have to limit us

2677
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,480
to the maximum

2678
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,480
Kill you, face-sucking

2679
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,480
Stop pretending

2680
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,480
Don't show too much

2681
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:42,480
Kill you, face-sucking

2682
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,480
Right
