The

00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,360
New Residents Recommended by You

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello everyone, I'm Jing Jing.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,600
Last year, when I came here,

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,640
this seemingly quiet city

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,880
was bustling with traffic.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,280
There were all kinds of rules passed by here.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,480
Whenever the sound of the Banyan River came to mind,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,720
an incredible thing happened.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
All of this was deeply affecting me.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,760
So I decided to settle down here

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,040
and ponder over the truth.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,800
But after I moved here,

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,440
things are getting more and more strange.

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,680
And the sound of the explosion of the gas that appears frequently.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,240
It's also because of my charm that I messed up the magnetic field here.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,720
This time, I'm going to join the He Li Magic Crystal and the推理團

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,560
to see what's hidden in this推式物.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,240
Okay, come, come, come.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,440
Okay.

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,440
Hello, everyone,

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,080
and the audience online.

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,720
Welcome to the推鎮,

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,200
no, it's推市.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
New residents are invited to live here.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,640
Also, welcome our old residents to go home.

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,440
Let's get some reaction.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,040
Thank you.

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,120
Very generous.

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,560
I almost forgot to introduce myself.

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
My name is Cui Shaoyang.

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,400
I agree to open the推3 of Tencent Video.

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
The press conference starts now.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,400
Oh, and I'm Cui Shaoyin.

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
I agree to open the推3.

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
The press conference starts now.

37
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,840
Okay.

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,440
As you can see,

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,360
the air pollution in推市 is very serious.

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,160
Every time there's a fog,

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,440
it means that a new event will happen.

42
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,960
But don't panic.

43
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,560
Everything in推市 is reasonable.

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,160
In order to make the new residents more familiar with推市,

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,360
we decided to hold a

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,640
Tencent Video's third season of推市奇文发布会.

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,240
We'll take you to the city's special event.

48
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,520
Thank you for the journey of both users.

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
The exclusive title of the third season of推市

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,400
is to explore the truth.

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,160
Let's start the journey of the city

52
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,920
with the power of the truth.

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,640
Next, let's welcome

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,840
the He Li Mo Jin Yu's team.

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Let's go.

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
We have a very thin friend here today.

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Let's welcome He Li Mo Jin Yu

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
to say hello.

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,560
Hello, everyone.

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,760
We are He Li Mo Jin Yu.

61
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,920
Welcome.

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Hello.

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,560
Okay.

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,400
Let's welcome everyone.

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,800
Let's start with Lin He.

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,200
Let's introduce ourselves.

67
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,120
Okay.

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,320
Hello, everyone.

69
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,480
I'm Bai Yu.

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm the first one to introduce myself.

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm the second one to introduce myself.

72
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm the wild man who is relaxed in推市.

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm also the giant of推市.

74
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,960
But if I have to say I'm the star of推市,

75
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,440
I think I'm still Zhang Lin He

76
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,960
who is doing a good job.

77
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,440
You're a little bit like Hansel and Gretel.

78
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,040
No, no.

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm telling the truth.

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,680
Okay, then, Bai Yu.

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,280
Hello, everyone.

82
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm

83
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,840
Dilili, Dilili, Dilili, Dilima.

84
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,520
I've unlocked N language system in推市.

85
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,600
But I admire Bai Yu the most.

86
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
Because when it's dark,

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,800
he will never be scared by the facial expression.

88
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,960
Okay, let's welcome Reba.

89
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,600
Hello, everyone.

90
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,920
I'm Jin Jin.

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm the most attractive person

92
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,800
in the whole推理團.

93
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
And I hope next time

94
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,160
I won't treat Reba

95
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,320
as our one-man toy.

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,960
Hello, everyone.

97
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,920
What hello?

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,720
Yes, next one.

99
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,440
Hello, everyone.

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm Liu Yuning.

101
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm very good at it.

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,160
I can hold anything

103
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,800
especially in the dark.

104
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm beautiful and flustered.

105
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm like a small deer.

106
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,840
You're a little bit like Hansel and Gretel.

107
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,800
Okay, next one.

108
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,240
Hello, everyone.

109
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm Zhang Lin He.

110
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,080
All the secrets of推市

111
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,000
can't escape my eyes.

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But if it's about strength,

113
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,080
I'm no match for Bai Yu.

114
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Liu Yuning.

115
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,400
Okay, okay.

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,520
Finally, let me introduce

117
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,360
Zhou Keyu,

118
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,400
the foreign reporter of our推市.

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,720
He's also a language artist

120
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,840
of our推市.

121
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,440
Today,

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,920
he's going to interview

123
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,800
the famous推市

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,320
of our推市.

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,960
So I hope I can meet you

126
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,200
next time.

127
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you, everyone.

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,080
Okay, thank you.

129
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,160
Thank you, too.

130
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,520
Do you want to introduce yourself?

131
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
Because there are many new residents.

132
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,840
Our He Li Mo Jin Yu,

133
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,040
what's the origin of this name?

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Why?

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,960
Last season was He Li Mo Yu.

136
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,120
This season,

137
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,840
Jin Jin joined our big family

138
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,080
and became He Li Mo Jin Yu.

139
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,120
So that's it.

140
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,880
What about Zhou Keyu?

141
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,080
Why don't you talk?

142
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Is it because you don't like to talk?

143
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,160
He's a liar.

144
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,280
I see.

145
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,560
He's more introverted.

146
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,320
Okay.

147
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,480
Recently,

148
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,640
the推市 has been very popular.

149
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,040
To let our new residents

150
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,760
know more about推市,

151
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,840
we're going to

152
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,480
have a series of reports

153
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
to reveal the truth of the fog.

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,840
Over the years,

155
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,680
there have been many

156
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,320
popular推市 news.

157
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
Some people return to nature.

158
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,560
Some people become toys.

159
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,480
Some people walk on the red carpet and seduce people.

160
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,320
Some people turn on the light

161
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,720
to turn on the sound.

162
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,360
Some people take out the microphone to reveal the truth.

163
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,080
Some people have their mouths poisoned.

164
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
What's behind these

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,520
seemingly strange events?

166
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,160
Now, let's move on to the first part.

167
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,240
The推市 news.

168
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,200
Let's investigate.

169
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
Thank you for your support.

170
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,200
The rules are very simple.

171
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,560
A member of the team

172
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,240
will draw a card

173
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,280
and tell everyone

174
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
the name of the person in charge.

175
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,800
The other four members

176
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,120
will use one minute of real time to

177
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,080
turn the card over.

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
The person who draws the card can be guided.

179
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,800
After one minute of countdown,

180
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,920
the person who guesses the closest truth

181
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,160
will win.

182
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,720
We collected the ideas

183
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,080
of the media friends in advance.

184
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,000
We made a surprise event punishment blind box

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,040
and a推市 friendly luck.

186
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,560
This prize blind box

187
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,480
is on the right side of the stage.

188
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,440
The members of the team

189
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,640
can draw the prize for the推市 friendly luck.

190
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,920
If no one guesses it right,

191
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,280
the drawer will receive a surprise punishment.

192
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,720
If you have any questions about the rules,

193
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,160
you can ask them.

194
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,560
I see.

195
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,920
There is a punishment and a reward, right?

196
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,440
That's right.

197
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,240
Okay, let's welcome the staff to show us the card.

198
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,280
This also requires us to

199
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
recommend a person

200
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,320
to draw the card.

201
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,240
Zi Zi, come on.

202
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,480
Where are you going?

203
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,240
Where are you going?

204
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,760
I'm going back.

205
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,360
Maybe you're lost.

206
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,800
Come on.

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,720
Please.

208
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
I'll choose one.

209
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,800
Come on.

210
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,880
I'll give you a card.

211
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,200
Okay.

212
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,520
You four need to discuss the rules.

213
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
See how to guide them

214
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,680
to guess the news.

215
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
And you,

216
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,960
Jing Jing,

217
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,920
can only tell them

218
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,560
the names of the two news clients.

219
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,800
But I can make actions, right?

220
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,640
Of course.

221
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,920
It's your business to guide them.

222
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,160
Zhang Linhe.

223
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,720
Yes.

224
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
Has it started?

225
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Zhou Keyu.

226
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,360
If so,

227
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,680
we'll start the countdown in one minute.

228
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
I see.

229
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
You stand low.

230
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,040
Yes.

231
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,600
What?

232
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,640
Zhang Linhe.

233
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,560
Red carpet.

234
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,760
You stand low.

235
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,720
When you take photos.

236
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,280
Zhou Keyu.

237
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,120
You see that?

238
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
The first day of the photoshoot,

239
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,040
he walked on the red carpet.

240
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,240
He said you stand low.

241
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,560
You stand low.

242
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,920
Or I won't be in the frame.

243
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,320
Zhou Keyu is half a head taller than me.

244
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,400
That's...

245
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
What's the complete one?

246
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,440
Yes, the complete one.

247
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,080
The complete one.

248
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,040
Zhang Linhe and Zhou Keyu.

249
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,240
When Zhang Linhe takes photos,

250
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
let Zhou Keyu squat down a little.

251
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,480
Congratulations to Zhang Linhe.

252
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,640
You got it right.

253
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Right?

254
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,440
Actually...

255
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Did he get the prize

256
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,520
or did I get the prize?

257
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
Of course he got the prize.

258
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,280
He got it right.

259
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,840
His prize

260
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,600
is equivalent to the prize of your whole group.

261
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
You can see that we

262
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,280
know each other very well.

263
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
It's really fast.

264
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,960
I feel like one minute is really

265
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,400
too much.

266
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,800
Let's welcome our Linhe

267
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
to draw our

268
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
lucky draw.

269
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
One for each, right?

270
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,040
Yes.

271
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,560
Okay.

272
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,880
What's the prize?

273
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
Read it out.

274
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,360
Get the three praises

275
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,280
of each member.

276
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,280
Each member has to praise me three times.

277
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,960
Linhe, you stand in the middle.

278
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Since you want to be praised,

279
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,840
you stand in the middle.

280
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,760
I accept the praise.

281
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,840
I stand in the middle.

282
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,520
You get a Q.

283
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,880
You can praise whoever you want.

284
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,600
Then let's do it in order.

285
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,320
Jingjing, you go first.

286
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,920
Tall, big, handsome.

287
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,080
Tall, big, handsome.

288
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
How do you explain it?

289
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,680
Tall, big, handsome.

290
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,040
I thought it was a new word.

291
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,360
Tall means tall.

292
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,160
Big means...

293
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,480
Big head.

294
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Big ears.

295
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,120
Handsome means handsome.

296
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,800
I get it.

297
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,440
Handsome, tall, big.

298
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,680
There are no other words, right?

299
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
It's handsome, tall, big.

300
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,080
Handsome, tall, big.

301
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
You can't change the word.

302
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,280
It's a new word.

303
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,960
Thank you.

304
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,840
Tall, handsome, big.

305
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
I can't do it.

306
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
I can't do it.

307
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,480
The rehearsal group.

308
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,640
Tall, tall, handsome.

309
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,440
It's like a snowman.

310
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,200
I tell you.

311
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Okay.

312
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,040
I get it.

313
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,960
Then you can explain it yourself.

314
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,040
What are the three advantages?

315
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,000
It's tall, big, handsome.

316
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
Okay.

317
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,320
Okay.

318
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,880
High-quality.

319
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,520
High-quality.

320
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,840
Okay.

321
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,920
Since it's so simple,

322
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,680
do you want to try again?

323
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,160
Okay.

324
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,560
Let's try.

325
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,200
Let's have another one to draw a card.

326
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,800
You go.

327
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,160
Go.

328
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,040
You go.

329
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,640
Two girls.

330
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,120
We'll...

331
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:25,880
Okay.

332
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,320
Are you ready?

333
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,160
You want to give me a gesture?

334
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,960
It's a little difficult.

335
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,480
Okay.

336
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,320
Dilireba.

337
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,720
Wait.

338
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,240
One minute.

339
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,440
Start.

340
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,320
Dilireba, Liu Yuning, Jin Jing.

341
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Dilireba, Liu Yuning.

342
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,040
Jin Jing.

343
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,720
We three have been discussing the plot.

344
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,080
We're talking about...

345
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,920
They two.

346
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,520
Liu Yuning and Dilireba must have a very intense discussion.

347
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,120
They must have a very intense discussion.

348
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,440
They must have a very intense quarrel.

349
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,400
There's one more.

350
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,080
What is Jin Jing doing?

351
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,320
Dilireba, Jin Jing, and Liu Yuning.

352
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,680
They must have a very intense quarrel.

353
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:10,920
No.

354
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,720
Very close.

355
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,760
Again.

356
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,640
They must have a very intense debate.

357
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
Dilireba, Liu Yuning.

358
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,680
Jin Jing.

359
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,400
Blind.

360
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,120
A little blind.

361
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,320
No.

362
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,880
Jin Jing.

363
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,760
A little confused.

364
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,040
In the middle.

365
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,560
Yes.

366
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:25,800
Come on.

367
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
Let's say it completely, Reba.

368
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
Dilireba, Liu Yuning.

369
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,600
They must have a very intense quarrel.

370
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,040
Jin Jing is in the middle.

371
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,680
Congratulations.

372
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,520
Correct.

373
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,440
Very close.

374
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,600
Almost.

375
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,560
When the question came out,

376
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,120
Reba was not thinking.

377
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
She got it right away.

378
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,160
Yes.

379
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,520
It happened yesterday.

380
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,760
So can you help us

381
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,800
to review what happened that day?

382
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,120
In the case of the truth,

383
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I really hate that famous scene.

384
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,400
No camera was taken.

385
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,080
I'm so ridiculous.

386
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,600
Fortunately, no camera was taken.

387
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,240
Yes.

388
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,400
Actually, the filming of the scene

389
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,600
has ended.

390
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,080
We went to the rest room.

391
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,600
Then we were still reluctant.

392
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,880
You, you, you, you, you, you.

393
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,800
Intense debate.

394
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,320
What kind of result will it be?

395
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,960
You can watch the show then.

396
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,560
Yes.

397
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Then we will

398
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,160
answer the correct answer this round.

399
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,640
Reba, we can also draw a

400
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,040
push friendly card.

401
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,760
Come on.

402
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,560
OK.

403
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,480
I'll draw it for her.

404
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,240
What is it?

405
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,320
I'll choose one person to sing a song

406
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,960
to praise you.

407
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll choose one person to sing a song

408
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,400
to praise you.

409
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,920
I'll choose the only sister.

410
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
Sing a song for me.

411
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,560
Use your voice.

412
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,040
Sister.

413
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,960
Here it comes.

414
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,520
I'll write a song for everyone.

415
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,080
I'll write a song for everyone.

416
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,440
You.

417
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,080
You.

418
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,560
You.

419
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Thank you.

420
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,840
Thank you.

421
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,760
It's good.

422
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,040
What do you think, Ke Yu?

423
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,480
Ke Yu just smiled.

424
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,200
OK.

425
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,520
After listening to the responses of the audience,

426
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,960
I believe that the new residents

427
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,840
have a good understanding of

428
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,120
this year's push.

429
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,480
Just now,

430
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
our foreign reporter, Ke Yu,

431
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,680
has reported five news reports for us.

432
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,840
Next, let's welcome He Li Mo Jin Yu

433
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,240
to take us into the six-minute column

434
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,480
to report the new news.

435
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
Come on.

436
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,640
Let's go.

437
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,040
I have some news here.

438
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,120
There are five in total.

439
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
Let's welcome the push team members to write a report.

440
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,880
Each member draws one.

441
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,320
Well, the members of the push team,

442
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,320
you can familiarize yourself with the news first.

443
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,440
Later, you can report it to us in your own style

444
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,280
and report it to the new residents.

445
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,880
What do I need to tell you?

446
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,280
In these five news reports,

447
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
there is a fake news.

448
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,200
After the report is over,

449
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,240
we will invite the new residents

450
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,520
to make a six-minute question and answer.

451
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,600
Who is the fake news?

452
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,560
Do you know?

453
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,680
This is what you are going to do later.

454
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's judge who is the fake news

455
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,320
among the six of us.

456
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,440
Yes.

457
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,960
One of these five is fake.

458
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,440
Do you know

459
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,280
your news now?

460
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,080
Let's do it together.

461
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,160
Okay.

462
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,640
Lin He.

463
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,280
I'll go first.

464
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,680
Okay.

465
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,640
Push special training.

466
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,760
The push team hides a Chinese doctor.

467
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,680
His skills are excellent.

468
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,000
You can know the cause

469
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,520
by just touching him.

470
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,840
As the Chinese doctor's reputation grows,

471
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,600
the patients are in a daze.

472
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,960
The schedule is full.

473
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,680
A loyal patient comes to the hospital.

474
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,200
He asks the doctor to cure his mouth poison.

475
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,880
The popular patient comes in the open.

476
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,280
He needs a doctor to cure his cowardly disease.

477
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,520
But

478
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,560
because so many people come to ask about it,

479
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,720
the old patients who want to get a second one

480
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,160
are getting more and more difficult.

481
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,920
You may have some judgment.

482
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,360
Next one, Bai Yu.

483
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,760
Recently, a strange incident

484
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,240
happened in the city.

485
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,560
Many handsome people

486
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,080
gathered on the street.

487
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,360
It's a good news.

488
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,240
It seems that a secret organization has appeared.

489
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,640
According to the witnesses,

490
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,440
the organization is mysterious.

491
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,160
It has three different effects.

492
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,360
It's four points and five points.

493
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,840
It's a long journey.

494
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,800
It's said that

495
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,440
their purpose is

496
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,800
to go to the big farm.

497
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,480
This sudden incident

498
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,920
has attracted the attention and guess of the people around.

499
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Okay, next one, Reba.

500
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,480
Dear audience,

501
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,560
this reporter sent a message.

502
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,440
Recently, a large-scale construction project

503
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,720
of the city's main building has been launched.

504
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,840
The construction of the main building

505
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,880
is in progress.

506
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,360
The project is designed by the aesthetician.

507
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,080
The person in charge of the construction

508
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,840
has been working for several minutes.

509
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,920
The main structure of the building has been completed.

510
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,360
Such a fast construction

511
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,560
attracts the attention of the people around.

512
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,040
Wow, it feels like a radio station.

513
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,920
I have to show my skills

514
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,640
in the sound of the radio.

515
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,200
Are you going to record it?

516
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,360
The female star gave out a red carpet to light the incense.

517
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,440
Why does it sound like this?

518
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
It's you.

519
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,960
Its beauty caused the ice-breaking incident.

520
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,120
In early 2025,

521
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,200
the second female star gave out a gorgeous party dress.

522
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,040
She went out to promote the small prize.

523
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,360
When she lit the incense and lit the red carpet,

524
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,320
her best condition surprised everyone.

525
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,720
The incident of the group cloud

526
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,480
happened unexpectedly.

527
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,880
The audience was shocked by the beauty.

528
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,480
The witness said that Dr. Liu arrived quickly.

529
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,960
After a series of checks,

530
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,040
they found that there was no answer.

531
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,200
Ten seconds later, they woke up.

532
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,560
I feel like I'm just showing this to myself.

533
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,800
This is a bit mysterious.

534
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,560
Did someone see it?

535
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,920
Do you think this is a true story?

536
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes.

537
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,640
Come on, is it true?

538
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,920
I'll leave it to the new residents of the sea.

539
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,640
Let's have Yu Ning give us a broadcast.

540
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,840
The fifth press release of the TuiShi special training,

541
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,280
according to the mysterious item

542
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,240
that must be transferred to the case when the item is copied.

543
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,760
According to the informant,

544
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,160
the private items of the popular residents

545
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,480
disappear when they reach the dark.

546
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,080
They will reappear when they reach the bright side.

547
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,680
After an emergency investigation by the relevant department of TuiShi,

548
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,760
it was found that its items

549
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,600
were controlled by some mysterious power

550
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
and tied to the street lighting of the city.

551
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,400
The residents of the white family said that

552
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,080
they had never lost their own items.

553
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,120
This reporter will continue to follow up on your reports.

554
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,880
Okay, thank you, Yu Ning.

555
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
So our five TuiShi special training

556
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
has been broadcast.

557
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,000
Now it's the turn of the new residents to start the question.

558
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,440
Countdown to 16 minutes.

559
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,680
Countdown starts.

560
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,520
If you have any questions, please raise your hand.

561
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,440
Let me ask Mr. Zhang Linhe.

562
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,840
First of all, what disease does the patient have?

563
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,600
What disease does the patient have?

564
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,240
The patient's disease before the patient

565
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,480
should be known by everyone.

566
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
Now it's not a disease.

567
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,040
The patient is in a training.

568
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,440
Everyone knows about the training.

569
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,240
This time, there is no target.

570
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
But it looks pretty good.

571
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,200
Very beautiful.

572
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,000
It has already led to the three people's death, right?

573
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,080
And when did the Chinese medicine come to TuiShi?

574
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,600
The Chinese medicine came to TuiShi three or four days ago.

575
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
It was already so famous three or four days ago?

576
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,360
Three or four days is enough for its reputation to spread.

577
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,760
Why did it come to life?

578
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,960
Because of its...

579
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,640
Elegance.

580
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,600
It's a professional skill.

581
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,280
Yes.

582
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,920
It's a very attractive combination of tricks.

583
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,320
I want to ask if there are any other new residents

584
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
who want to ask questions.

585
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,840
Okay, please pass the microphone.

586
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,760
Hello, I want to ask Mr. Jingjing.

587
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,960
This is your fainted incident.

588
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Let's review some of the elements of this scene.

589
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,560
This is the time and place.

590
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,400
What characters are there?

591
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,880
The time was in early 2025.

592
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,160
The location is TuiGuangXiaoShang.

593
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,320
The characters are the two-character goddess,

594
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,000
the state of beauty and everyone who is fainted.

595
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,840
I want to ask again.

596
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,560
What was the specific situation

597
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,840
of the fainted incident?

598
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,000
The specific situation is that the two-character goddess

599
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,240
is too elegant and

600
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,560
she hit everyone.

601
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,120
She is too strong and has poor physical strength.

602
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,400
She is not strong enough and fainted.

603
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,680
Who is the person who fainted?

604
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Everyone.

605
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,520
A bunch of people.

606
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

607
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,880
I don't know what their names are.

608
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,720
They don't have ID cards.

609
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,320
Are there any residents who want to ask questions?

610
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,200
Okay, please pass the microphone.

611
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,240
Please ask.

612
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,320
I want to ask Mr. Reba.

613
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,640
You mentioned that

614
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,840
the castle was built in the middle of the road

615
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,520
through the traffic.

616
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,120
Yes.

617
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,360
When was it built?

618
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,760
Didn't the car come?

619
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,160
Because the princess was going to live there,

620
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,720
the construction in the middle of the road through the traffic

621
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,360
caused everyone to discuss.

622
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,960
I want to ask

623
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,040
what method did the person in charge of the capital use?

624
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,640
Why did it take a few minutes to build it?

625
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,640
Because he is a very good master,

626
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,160
the person in charge of the capital.

627
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,080
So,

628
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,240
his few minutes are equivalent to

629
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,840
the months of others.

630
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,600
So impressive.

631
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,120
Yes.

632
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,800
So he used a few minutes

633
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,560
to change the atmosphere of the scene

634
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,120
and let everyone listen to his instructions.

635
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,880
Because he has this ability.

636
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,480
Okay.

637
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:48,960
Okay.

638
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,240
Are there any questions?

639
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
Please pass the microphone.

640
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,040
Hello, I want to ask Liu Yining.

641
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,920
What did this popular resident

642
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,720
lose specifically?

643
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,480
He is a...

644
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440
Something that he can't touch.

645
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,160
How many times did he lose?

646
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,880
He said that

647
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,080
every time he loses his light,

648
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,640
this thing will disappear.

649
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,960
But anyway,

650
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,000
Bai Yu has never lost anything.

651
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,240
Why don't common people lose these things?

652
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Because he...

653
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,000
No.

654
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Nothing can be lost.

655
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,280
Nothing can be lost.

656
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,840
Okay.

657
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,800
Next resident.

658
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,760
I want to ask Bai Yu.

659
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,160
What is the specific time

660
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,640
when this mysterious incident happened?

661
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,840
Hao Hongliang.

662
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,240
The specific time

663
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,600
is a few days ago.

664
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,720
Right?

665
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,520
I forgot the specific time a few days ago.

666
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,960
And then the first point is

667
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,040
once in a prosperous neighborhood.

668
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,280
In a prosperous neighborhood in Tui City.

669
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,160
I also heard it at that time.

670
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,960
There was a group of very handsome people.

671
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,480
And then they had something in their hands.

672
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,960
They were standing there,

673
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,120
not knowing what they were doing.

674
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Anyway, they were very handsome.

675
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,920
This one sounds like fake news.

676
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,480
Okay, we don't have any questions yet.

677
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,520
Our time is almost up.

678
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,600
Okay, our six minutes have come.

679
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,840
So, with us for a while,

680
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,400
the new residents under the stage

681
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,640
will judge according to the five questions

682
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,800
that you just answered.

683
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,680
Everyone can only vote.

684
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,600
Okay?

685
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,120
If you're ready,

686
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,560
let's start with Linghe.

687
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,160
If you think Linghe is broadcasting fake news,

688
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,040
please raise your hand.

689
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,760
Okay.

690
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,080
None of you.

691
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,960
If you think Bai Yu is broadcasting fake news,

692
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,720
please raise your hand.

693
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,400
One vote.

694
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,360
If you think Reba is broadcasting fake news,

695
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,160
please raise your hand.

696
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,920
Raise your hand higher.

697
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,640
One, two, three, four, five, six.

698
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,040
Eleven, no, twelve.

699
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,720
It seems that beauty is also a kind of sin.

700
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
If you think Jin Jing is broadcasting fake news,

701
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,240
please raise your hand.

702
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,960
One, two, three, four, five.

703
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,680
Five votes.

704
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,560
None of you is broadcasting fake news.

705
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,480
Five votes.

706
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,080
Now...

707
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,880
These four people don't trust your beauty.

708
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,520
At this point?

709
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,280
Yes.

710
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,080
Okay.

711
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,800
If you think Yu Ning is broadcasting fake news,

712
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,560
please raise your hand.

713
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,320
One vote.

714
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,080
Is it really true?

715
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,800
Is it true?

716
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,400
It's true.

717
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,520
Okay.

718
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,680
Now that everyone has voted,

719
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,120
Reba is a high-ranking voter.

720
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,920
Who is the real one broadcasting fake news?

721
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,880
Please take a big step forward.

722
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,600
Come on.

723
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,560
Mine is the fake news.

724
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,840
Oh, you guessed wrong.

725
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,120
You all know how to lose.

726
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,080
In my news,

727
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,560
most of it is true.

728
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
But the three patients behind me

729
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,600
came to ask for treatment.

730
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,880
Actually, there are fake news.

731
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,640
Both Zhou Xing and Liu Xing patients

732
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,000
didn't come to ask for treatment.

733
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,120
Only Jin Jing came to have a re-examination.

734
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,320
I also took a pulse for her.

735
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,800
The Chinese doctor also took a pulse for her.

736
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,120
She is very healthy.

737
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,280
The patient said this time

738
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,840
she would never have this symptom again.

739
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,040
This time, she is definitely

740
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,480
the iron blanket in our team.

741
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,520
That's me.

742
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,640
Is it iron?

743
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,800
Is it iron blanket?

744
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,840
It's made of iron.

745
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,200
A few days ago, did everyone think she was an iron blanket?

746
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,920
It's okay.

747
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
It's okay. There's progress.

748
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,760
It's okay.

749
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,240
Then, Reba, the high-ranking voter,

750
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,680
please tell us what happened.

751
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,440
Because mine is the real news.

752
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,360
It says that we were on the red carpet that day

753
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
because there was a live broadcast.

754
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,520
Then, I awkwardly took out a castle.

755
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,200
So, it was really in the middle of the road

756
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,160
where people were passing by.

757
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,520
I put on a red carpet.

758
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,840
Actually, it was in front of the farmhouse.

759
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,400
Then, there were a lot of staff.

760
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,440
Then, there was the person in charge of the gold.

761
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,520
He guided me.

762
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,960
He walked on the red carpet with his head up.

763
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
So, this red treasure

764
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,320
was taken out by my toes.

765
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,800
This is the real news.

766
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,600
Yes.

767
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,800
So, I want to congratulate our Zhang Linghe this time.

768
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,680
He successfully covered everyone with his own broadcast.

769
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,480
You also got a push to be friendly.

770
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,160
Is it the second time?

771
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,120
Pick one more.

772
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,080
Pick one more.

773
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,600
I will appoint someone to fulfill a wish for you.

774
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,080
I will appoint someone to fulfill a wish for me.

775
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,800
A wish card.

776
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,040
What wish?

777
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,200
It's time to make someone move.

778
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,200
It reminds me.

779
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,600
In this season,

780
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,640
we have a common goal in the group.

781
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
It's called...

782
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,400
Defeat the evil force.

783
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,960
No.

784
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,000
Absolutely.

785
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,680
So, I'm here with a full heart.

786
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm here to be the head of the group.

787
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,960
I want the evil force to dance for us.

788
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,200
Or sing a song.

789
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,040
Is it okay?

790
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,480
Who is the evil force?

791
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,760
The evil force is Mr. Bai Yu.

792
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,840
Please welcome Mr. Bai Yu.

793
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,640
Come on.

794
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,120
He can dance and sing.

795
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,480
He can sing and dance.

796
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,040
Yes.

797
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,200
In the show,

798
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,800
we have a dance.

799
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,960
We have learned a dance.

800
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,720
Can you show us?

801
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,640
I suddenly remember a dance.

802
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,280
You can invite your partner.

803
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,120
I invite my partner.

804
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,680
No.

805
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,280
It's me.

806
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,000
I forgot the song.

807
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,440
But I...

808
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,720
I admit that

809
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,320
I'm not good at coordination.

810
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,480
But I'm trying to

811
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,320
recreate the dance I learned.

812
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,120
Okay.

813
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,600
Come on.

814
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,560
Music.

815
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,920
Is there music?

816
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,360
There's music.

817
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,600
This part is familiar.

818
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,640
The last one is important.

819
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,600
The last one is important.

820
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,680
This one.

821
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,120
You dance that one.

822
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
What do you think it is?

823
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Do it together.

824
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,280
Do you want to dance with him?

825
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,120
Come on.

826
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,280
Together.

827
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Help me realize my dream.

828
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,320
You forgot that one.

829
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,840
Come on.

830
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,160
Together.

831
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,600
Three, two, one.

832
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,280
Left face.

833
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,160
Last pose.

834
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,840
Three, two, one.

835
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,480
Come on.

836
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,360
Do you see it clearly?

837
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,640
You don't see it clearly, right?

838
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,440
No.

839
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,200
If you don't see it clearly,

840
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,280
you can continue to watch our video.

841
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,200
How about it?

842
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,960
Are you satisfied with your wish?

843
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,680
What do you think?

844
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
I feel very happy.

845
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,200
Okay.

846
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm happy.

847
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,960
Okay.

848
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,280
The QIWEN of our推市

849
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,480
always comes out

850
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,920
and goes up.

851
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,720
Every QIWEN resident

852
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,840
may become

853
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
QIWEN's client.

854
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,360
It's reasonable to touch

855
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,720
the six members of the QIWEN.

856
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,520
It's no exception.

857
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,680
Let's have a look

858
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,960
at the six-person QIWEN.

859
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,000
Let's see which QIWEN

860
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,040
is related to each other.

861
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,080
What do they think

862
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,520
about each other?

863
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,120
Old actor.

864
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,240
He was also there in the last season, right?

865
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,480
Yes.

866
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,240
There are many

867
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,640
related words on it.

868
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,680
You can choose one

869
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,600
to match the words

870
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,280
they said in the third season of

871
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,600
The beginning of the 8th season.

872
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,880
Choose a word for each person

873
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
and paste it on each other.

874
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,640
Paste it on everyone.

875
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,880
Don't forget to paste it on

876
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,560
the reporters outside.

877
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,120
Except for him,

878
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,560
we should have four

879
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,080
stickers on each person.

880
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,720
OK?

881
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,120
Come on.

882
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,200
We can choose.

883
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,040
Choose whatever you want.

884
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,280
OK.

885
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,320
Come on.

886
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,440
Except for yourself,

887
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
paste it on someone else.

888
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,280
Yes.

889
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,320
Of course.

890
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,760
Choose a sticker for each person.

891
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Four stickers for each person.

892
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,640
Five stickers for each person.

893
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Put on a fish.

894
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,680
But you can't put on a fish.

895
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
So you have four stickers for each person.

896
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,720
OK.

897
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:21,240
A Version of the

898
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,540
Collection of Wutang

899
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Everyone is choosing very seriously

900
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
How many can you choose?

901
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
You have to put one on each person

902
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Put one on each person

903
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
But you can put more on

904
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Put more on

905
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Leave a few

906
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Next round

907
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Can I pick two by myself?

908
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Of course

909
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Who should I choose?

910
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Maybe you have more feelings

911
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
In the new season

912
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Ok

913
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Can I put it on the back?

914
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
It's ok to put it on the back

915
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Is it hard to put on the light?

916
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
I'll put it on the back

917
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
If it's not easy to put on

918
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
We can give it to each other

919
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
We can put it on Keyu

920
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,560
We can take the rest to our hands

921
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,560
Because our clothes are very expensive

922
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
It's hard to put on

923
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
I'll give you this

924
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
If you can't put it on, you can take it to your hands

925
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
There must be one person who can't put on four

926
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
What should I do?

927
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
You can't put on five

928
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
I've already put on four

929
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Ok, enough

930
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Why are there five?

931
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
How can there be five people who can put it on?

932
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Maybe one person sent two

933
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Maybe Keyu is here

934
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
I sent two

935
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Maybe someone wants to target you

936
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
It's ok, one more

937
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
One more

938
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
You're too shy to take it yourself

939
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
I'll give it to myself

940
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I'll give it to you

941
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Ok, are we done?

942
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Yes

943
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
End

944
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
I've finished

945
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
I haven't put on Keyu

946
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
We can see that everyone is a little

947
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
There's one more

948
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
A little rich

949
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Let's show what brand we got

950
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Let's start from Lin He

951
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,560
Let's talk about why we put on these

952
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
What did Lin He get?

953
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
IE browser

954
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
What does this mean?

955
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Who put it on?

956
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Sometimes, for example, some people need to calculate

957
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
He's very good

958
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
It's a big thing

959
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Understand

960
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,560
He thought it was saying that

961
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
IE browser is very lagging

962
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
It's hard to recognize

963
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
Golden hair, brain, hairpin, mouth

964
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Golden hair, brain, brain, hairpin, mouth

965
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Who put it on?

966
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
I did

967
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,560
His brain is actually very useful

968
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
But every time he said he was the murderer

969
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
He was like

970
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
You can use it

971
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
How to react?

972
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Push the dance button

973
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Push the dance button

974
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,560
I put this on

975
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Because I think the first episode

976
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
My biggest gain is that I learned a dance

977
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
What dance?

978
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Who's laughing so loudly?

979
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Little brain

980
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Little brain

981
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
I put it on

982
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Actually, I mean the same as Ning

983
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Golden hair, brain, hairpin, mouth

984
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Zhang Lin and everyone can see his

985
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
The appearance is very powerful

986
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
The noble son

987
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
We had a big paragraph a few days ago

988
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Just recognize his monologue

989
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Why are you why are you

990
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Then Zhang Linhe is over there

991
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
The first light is about to reflect

992
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Then he walked over and said

993
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Not me

994
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
You're all talking about your noses

995
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Push the eagle eye

996
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
You gave it to me

997
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
This is actually

998
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
It's pretty accurate to see people

999
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
Really

1000
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Although we say the sky is full of flowers

1001
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
But sometimes it's actually very accurate

1002
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
It's not necessarily accurate every time

1003
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Yesterday was very accurate

1004
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Who is the most inaccurate

1005
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Who is the most inaccurate

1006
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Who is the most inaccurate

1007
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Please look forward to our next episode

1008
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
We are all accurate

1009
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
A small eye

1010
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Then let's take a look at our Bai Yu

1011
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Bai Yu also has five brands

1012
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
Let's take a look

1013
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
The big eye

1014
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,560
Because

1015
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Because

1016
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
If you broadcast it, you can see

1017
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I won't go in advance

1018
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
I understand your intention

1019
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
I can't guess his identity

1020
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Okay, what about our next one?

1021
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
This

1022
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
Wu Di

1023
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
I gave it to him

1024
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Give him a nickname

1025
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
What's the name

1026
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
White cannon

1027
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Yes, it's not open yet

1028
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
I think there will be a link later

1029
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
I remember in the last episode

1030
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Actually, it's very effective

1031
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
I don't accept this

1032
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Every time he meets a door that is not open

1033
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Break open

1034
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
We have to solve the mystery

1035
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
He said no, break open

1036
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
It's already changed

1037
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
More destructive

1038
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Okay, what about the next one?

1039
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
Emotional stabilizer

1040
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
This is what I gave him

1041
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
He is too stable

1042
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
How you shout

1043
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
He can't stand up from that chair

1044
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
I think he's the best

1045
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
We have about

1046
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
More than ten scenes

1047
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
He can always find

1048
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
The stool that belongs to him in every scene

1049
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
I have a bias

1050
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
There were 16 stools that day

1051
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
Just 16 stools

1052
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
I sat there, how can you find a stool again?

1053
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
I said you go ahead

1054
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Because we

1055
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
For example, when we usually push the gifts

1056
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
We have a small stool prepared

1057
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,560
We sit on a small stool

1058
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Then he walked away in our chat

1059
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
We thought he was thinking of some clues

1060
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
He went back and pushed a chair

1061
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Sit on

1062
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
This is good

1063
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
He is like this

1064
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Sit very stable

1065
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
And a god of intelligence

1066
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
I posted this

1067
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
He is a very

1068
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Emotional stability

1069
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Then the IQ is back

1070
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Then

1071
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
You still love him so much

1072
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
I also want to say this

1073
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,560
I thought it was over

1074
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
I thought after last night

1075
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
I didn't expect you to wake up and forget again

1076
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,560
And the last one

1077
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Relaxing wild man

1078
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
I gave him

1079
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
He is very relaxed

1080
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
There

1081
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Sit wild

1082
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Very relaxed

1083
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,560
I understand

1084
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
It's quite contradictory

1085
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Emotional stability

1086
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Yes, very contrast

1087
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Then Reba got

1088
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Four rowing

1089
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
This is my

1090
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Yes

1091
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
He likes to watch

1092
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
The kind of play

1093
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Every time we finished playing

1094
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,560
I have to tell Reba

1095
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Come and talk

1096
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
What

1097
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
I didn't expect to see

1098
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Like this

1099
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Then the second one

1100
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,560
The inspirations of the stylist

1101
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
I gave it

1102
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Every time Reba's styling is very amazing

1103
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Then last time

1104
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Isn't that the last solo?

1105
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Not that one, the blonde hair

1106
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,560
The one you said you imitated

1107
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Blue eyeshadow

1108
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
I imitated

1109
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,560
Which style didn't have a hair?

1110
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Golden hair

1111
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,560
The third one

1112
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
He really knows he is a princess

1113
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
I can't come out in the hot search

1114
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Then his original video

1115
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
He was like this when he was walking

1116
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,560
I may not be like what I learned

1117
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
After I finished watching

1118
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
I kept looking in front of the mirror

1119
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Listen to me

1120
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,560
How can you jump like that

1121
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,560
OK

1122
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
The third one is the living micro

1123
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
I posted

1124
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,560
Because I think this is

1125
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,560
This trick has fooled us many times

1126
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560
He is very good at acting like a living micro

1127
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,560
This is one of his

1128
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Under a specific role

1129
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
A trick that will be used

1130
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,560
And every time it will fool us

1131
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
He will abstract

1132
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Say some very strange words

1133
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
There is also a sense of contrast

1134
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,560
Can't be too clear

1135
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,560
But it's a living micro

1136
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Looking forward to the real film or that sentence

1137
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Last one

1138
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
I gave it

1139
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,560
He will imitate a lot

1140
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
A lot of ways to speak

1141
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,560
It's very similar

1142
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,560
And you can imitate it at once

1143
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,560
So when I was broadcasting the news

1144
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
I really feel very professional

1145
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
Then our next

1146
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
What is the label on Jin Jing?

1147
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
OK, the first label

1148
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
The brain is back to the light

1149
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,560
Who posted

1150
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,560
I guess everyone wants to post

1151
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
It should be me

1152
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
Because he

1153
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,560
This season has him join

1154
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,560
The whole brain of our story

1155
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Will increase a lot of lines

1156
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
And there are a lot of funny places

1157
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,560
This

1158
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,560
It's on my smile

1159
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,560
It's me

1160
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Because he is every time

1161
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
No matter what I say, I want to laugh

1162
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,560
Because it's really effective

1163
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,560
Actually, not only me, everyone will laugh

1164
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Yes, happy Jin Jing

1165
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Will be active

1166
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
A scene

1167
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Sometimes people are really nervous

1168
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Some people say they are tired

1169
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Yes

1170
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,560
I need this kind of person

1171
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,560
The god of CCD

1172
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
What does CCD mean?

1173
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
Camera

1174
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
That camera

1175
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
I gave him a picture

1176
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,560
With your cooperation

1177
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
Your real appearance

1178
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Your team allowed it

1179
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
No problem

1180
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,560
We look forward to that picture

1181
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,560
OK, there is one more

1182
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,560
Master of acupuncture

1183
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
I gave it to him

1184
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
Sometimes

1185
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
When we enter an awkward situation

1186
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
He will wake us up

1187
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Like yesterday

1188
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
The difficulty of eating

1189
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Is all awakened

1190
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,560
Change the mood

1191
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Yes, acupuncture

1192
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
I didn't prepare at all

1193
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
We can eat

1194
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
He suddenly stood up

1195
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,560
These little beasts

1196
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,920
No

1197
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
That's good

1198
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Let's see the label on Yu Ning

1199
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
After turning off the light

1200
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Life is so bitter

1201
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I gave it to him

1202
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
This is not mine

1203
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
What do you want to say?

1204
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
I want to say

1205
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,920
Life is not so bitter this time

1206
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Yes, but it's okay

1207
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,920
This time is fine

1208
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Because this time, there are not so many

1209
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
It's a moment of suffering

1210
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
So it's actually okay

1211
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
But I look forward to the recording after

1212
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
OK

1213
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Will have this expression

1214
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Yes, I think this time you are

1215
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Life is bitter after turning on the light

1216
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
No, you can't say that

1217
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Who made him suffer

1218
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Let's look forward to the real film

1219
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
What is this?

1220
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
The best song of K-POP

1221
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
You should give

1222
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
The best song

1223
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm confused

1224
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
No, I mean he expressed his apology

1225
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Why are you still talking about him?

1226
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
This is not to express my apology

1227
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
This is my true thought

1228
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
I think he is a negative

1229
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,920
You gave it to him

1230
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,920
I gave it to him

1231
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
I just let these four words

1232
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Wake you up

1233
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Don't be confused by the best song

1234
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Some people's true faces

1235
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
You have to see clearly

1236
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
OK, let's start from today

1237
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
Right?

1238
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Recommend a famous hot-hose manufacturer

1239
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Hot-hose manufacturer

1240
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
I think I want to give this to others

1241
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,920
I took it for a long time

1242
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,920
I just gave it to others

1243
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
What do you think the best

1244
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
Hot-hose manufacturer should be

1245
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
Actually everyone has

1246
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
I thought only Jin Jing

1247
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Because he may be a little bit picky

1248
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Everyone else has

1249
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
I think the dance just now is great

1250
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
The loose feeling of old Bai

1251
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Reba's

1252
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Slightly ugly

1253
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Slightly ugly

1254
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
Jin Jing, including our brother's poisonous snake

1255
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
Can create a lot of hot-hose characters

1256
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
In our team

1257
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
This label should belong to us

1258
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
Yes

1259
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920
There is another

1260
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
Super detailed

1261
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,920
Because I actually

1262
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
I really have a new understanding of Ning brother

1263
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
I found you

1264
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
I am very meticulous

1265
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
Very good at reasoning

1266
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
And your biggest feature

1267
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,920
You are very sure of the details

1268
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,920
But your biggest flaw is

1269
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
You can't escape in these details

1270
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
I seem

1271
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
OK, thank you five

1272
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,920
We can see that our science and language

1273
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
Actually also has some labels

1274
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,920
Everyone, why don't you pick one or two to say

1275
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Oh, this

1276
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
Can't hide the age of the words

1277
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
Sometimes he thinks of something

1278
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
He will say, brother, I tell you

1279
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,920
He will be like this

1280
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
But he hid it today

1281
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Who posted it

1282
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
Who posted the retreating drum

1283
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
Who posted

1284
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,920
I didn't post

1285
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
Because he wasn't there

1286
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
So I posted more

1287
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,920
Sometimes he will

1288
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
Very certain

1289
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,920
For example, the two of us

1290
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
We both suspected you at that time

1291
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
He started to suspect you absolutely

1292
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,920
Then I felt like it didn't work

1293
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
It seems to be very good at the beginning

1294
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Suspended himself

1295
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
I posted the big mountain boy

1296
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
He can really eat

1297
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
You are embarrassed to say others

1298
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
I am also

1299
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
We are the big mountain boys in our group

1300
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
You two have a good summary

1301
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
What

1302
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Eat

1303
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
What else

1304
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
This is also posted by me

1305
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
Licked the lips and was poisoned to death by himself

1306
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
He has a feeling of

1307
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
A little bit of a childless feeling

1308
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
He is a little childless

1309
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Sometimes the mouth is quite poisonous

1310
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
What else

1311
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Nanqiang is the champion

1312
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
We have something that can't climb

1313
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,920
Or very tired

1314
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,920
All of them go

1315
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
For example, some places are particularly difficult to climb

1316
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
He took the initiative to rush over

1317
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,160
New members of the

1318
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
Push judges

1319
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I posted the judges

1320
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
Because I think sometimes

1321
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,920
He can bring up some points that you may not have seen

1322
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,920
Then go

1323
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,920
To let everyone jump out of this

1324
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
A hot topic

1325
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,920
Then change the way

1326
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,920
To think of another result

1327
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,920
Another possibility

1328
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
There is also a push-in motor

1329
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Is

1330
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Is it a living limit?

1331
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920
Young

1332
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
While eating while pushing

1333
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Since you appreciate these points

1334
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Why don't you own these points

1335
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
Because I'm old, please forgive me

1336
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
You can see that we all have our own labels

1337
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
This season, our push-in group has been upgraded

1338
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Become reasonable

1339
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
What is this group in your eyes

1340
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Everyone chooses a word

1341
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
Let us paste it on our board, okay?

1342
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
Everyone chooses a board

1343
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,920
Behind this is a group board

1344
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
We each choose a word to paste on the board

1345
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,920
Paste on the back, right?

1346
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,920
This group in your eyes

1347
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
This

1348
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
I will turn it over

1349
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
Okay

1350
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,920
Come on

1351
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Everyone please paste

1352
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
Everyone please paste

1353
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,920
We each come

1354
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
The world's bulletin machine

1355
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
I paste

1356
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,920
Because I think

1357
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,920
Everyone watching our show

1358
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
There should be a lot of things to say

1359
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
A lot of things to say

1360
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
A lot of hot topics or some fun points

1361
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,920
So there should be a lot of bulletin

1362
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
It looks very exciting

1363
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
Then there are the noise in my eyes

1364
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,920
Yes, the whole show

1365
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
You look like we are usually

1366
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Very

1367
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
Sad, right?

1368
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,920
Don't like to talk, but in the whole show

1369
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
We keep talking

1370
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,920
I went back yesterday and my tongue was numb

1371
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
Yes

1372
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,920
I'm really noisy

1373
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,920
I thought it was the kind of noise after turning off the lights

1374
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
There will be screams at that time

1375
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,920
Something like that

1376
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
A strong evidence appears

1377
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
No matter what, let's go first

1378
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
Please wait a moment

1379
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
And it's very friendly to my eyes

1380
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,920
I know, everyone knows

1381
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
Yes, everyone knows

1382
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
Especially teacher Jin

1383
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
I paste

1384
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Our group looks like

1385
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
It will be noisy

1386
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,920
A lot of sad people

1387
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,920
Except Jingjing

1388
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
It seems to be all sad people

1389
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
Really?

1390
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
Yes

1391
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,920
I, Ning, Ke Yu are all sad people

1392
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
You said we three are all sad people

1393
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Yes, we are all sad people

1394
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,920
One side is sad, the other side is sad

1395
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,920
Yes

1396
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,920
We are all sad people

1397
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,920
Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to get 30 seats

1398
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,920
Yes

1399
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
And the last one, you made me laugh

1400
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,920
This

1401
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,920
Yes, you always make me laugh

1402
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,920
Who made you laugh?

1403
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,920
The show

1404
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Listen to the words

1405
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,920
Ok, our label has been pasted

1406
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,920
After a series of reports

1407
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,920
I believe that the new residents

1408
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Have a certain understanding of our推

1409
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,920
Everyone should have a lot of questions about the reasonable carp

1410
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Next is the last part

1411
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,920
We will hand the microphone to the new residents

1412
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
Anyone who wants to ask the推 team

1413
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
You can raise your hand to ask

1414
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
Come on, let's give the microphone to him

1415
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
Does anyone want to give the microphone?

1416
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Please say

1417
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
Who is the most reasonable and reasonable in the group?

1418
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,920
This time, the whole group

1419
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Who do you think has the biggest change?

1420
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,920
Who has the biggest change?

1421
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,920
Liu Yining

1422
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
Ning, yes

1423
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
Because it seems that he is not afraid anymore

1424
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,920
Because we

1425
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,920
It can be said

1426
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
He used to be behind me

1427
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
But this time he stood in front of me

1428
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920
Who said that the one standing in the light is the hero?

1429
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,920
Liu

1430
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,920
Thank you

1431
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
It's my duty

1432
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,920
Anyone else

1433
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
Who wants to ask the question?

1434
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
Come on

1435
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
Take the microphone

1436
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,920
Please ask

1437
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
My question is for all members

1438
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
I just felt some of your group spirit

1439
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
So this season

1440
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,920
I'm curious about what you are in charge of in this show

1441
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,920
I just heard some small changes

1442
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,920
Will there be some new

1443
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,920
What is your role in this season?

1444
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
You can start from Zhang Minghe

1445
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Start from me

1446
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,920
I'm sorry

1447
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,920
What is my role in the last season?

1448
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
The last season

1449
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,920
The appearance

1450
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
The role of the 100-year-old bird

1451
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,920
The role of the singer

1452
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,920
You have a few labels in the last season

1453
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,920
Move KTV, promote the 100-year-old bird

1454
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Not temporary power, double-producing machine

1455
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,920
This is

1456
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,920
Then this season

1457
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
I want to be a steady person

1458
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Steady

1459
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
You have a push-back

1460
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Of course

1461
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,420
You're breaking the

1462
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,420
I'm lazy

1463
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,420
What about you, teacher?

1464
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,420
Because

1465
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,420
I think our group is too strong

1466
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,420
It's a little scary

1467
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,920
So I have to make our group look not so strong

1468
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,420
So I'll be the one in charge of the back

1469
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,920
I'm modest

1470
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
I'll give you a little back-up

1471
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,920
Don't make you so strong

1472
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,920
Anyway, it's a back-up of a person

1473
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,920
That's right, that's right

1474
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,920
I'm going to be this time

1475
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,920
I'm going to be

1476
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,920
I'm in charge of the back-up

1477
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,920
Back-up

1478
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,920
Which side of the back-up

1479
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,920
Just maybe

1480
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,920
Because this

1481
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,920
Everyone should watch the first and second episodes

1482
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,420
You should be able to see where the contrast is

1483
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,420
So I want to be

1484
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,420
Let people guess

1485
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,420
What is my role in the end

1486
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,420
Can't see

1487
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,420
Teacher Jingjing

1488
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,420
You summed it up for her

1489
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,420
The mysterious person

1490
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,420
The woman in the maze

1491
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,420
I feel like she's got you too

1492
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,420
She's got me too

1493
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,420
I'm myself

1494
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,420
What's my role

1495
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,420
It's hard to say

1496
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Beautiful

1497
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,920
So many responsibilities

1498
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,920
Beauty is one of your most unworthy things

1499
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,920
Don't talk about beauty anymore

1500
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,920
Because I'm pretty sure everyone will listen to me

1501
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Yes

1502
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,920
Then I'll

1503
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
You can summarize for me

1504
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
I really can't think of a short way

1505
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
I think she looks like she's in charge of the atmosphere

1506
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
But in fact

1507
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,920
Right

1508
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,920
Yes, that's right

1509
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,920
In fact, she's in the whole reasoning

1510
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,420
Including the control room

1511
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,420
Or this

1512
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,420
She's very good

1513
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,420
Logic

1514
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,420
Yes, I thought of it too

1515
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,420
And she has the best point

1516
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,420
She won't be disturbed by others

1517
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,420
She seems to be disturbed

1518
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,420
Very persistent

1519
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,420
And you just said control room, I'm not a control room

1520
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,420
I just want to control you

1521
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,420
But I can't control

1522
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,420
Ok

1523
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,420
Then to Liu Ming

1524
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,920
I think I'm

1525
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,920
I know what you are

1526
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,920
You say

1527
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,920
What do you mean

1528
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
If you want to say something, you have to say it

1529
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Everyone will be immersed in your logic

1530
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Just control us

1531
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Is that so

1532
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Didn't control us

1533
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,920
I think I'm

1534
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,920
Just a brick

1535
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Where do I need to go

1536
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,920
Just block every

1537
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,420
You don't need to go anywhere

1538
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,420
I need to be a brick in this season

1539
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,420
Yes, this is the most correct

1540
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,420
Ok

1541
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,920
Chongfeng County, Changshan, Zhaozi

1542
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,920
All courage

1543
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,920
Ok

1544
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
You have too many skills

1545
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,920
Just look forward to this season

1546
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,920
She can work for me

1547
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,920
Is there anyone else to ask

1548
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,920
I want to ask Reba

1549
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,420
Can this familiar game give you a sense of security?

1550
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,920
I saw a video you took before

1551
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
This abstract video may be very cute

1552
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,920
I want to ask

1553
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,920
How did you persuade you to start pushing

1554
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,920
That's because I saw a similar video online

1555
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,920
So it's not a push to persuade me

1556
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,920
I think it's pretty fun

1557
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,920
Then because

1558
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Maybe you see some dry words

1559
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Maybe it's not very attractive

1560
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,920
To watch our show

1561
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,920
So I want to

1562
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,420
I want to recommend you

1563
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,420
To watch our show

1564
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,420
Some of the videos

1565
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,420
To make you interested

1566
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,420
Then you have to say why you came

1567
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,420
Because I think last season was actually very happy

1568
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,420
Then although I

1569
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,420
A little stupid

1570
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,420
Can't have that logic

1571
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,420
But just very happy

1572
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,420
Everyone is happy together

1573
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,420
So I continued to come to the third season

1574
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,920
Then we haven't asked questions yet

1575
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,920
Please ask

1576
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,920
I want to ask Zhang Linghe

1577
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,920
Everyone is joking

1578
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
After the birth of Jingjing's child

1579
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
Zhang Linghe's first question will be

1580
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,920
To solve this question

1581
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,920
So will there be a chance

1582
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,920
To teach the little nephew's homework or something?

1583
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,920
I think Jingjing's child

1584
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,920
If she can speak

1585
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
The first sentence is definitely not as good as mine

1586
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,420
I will never

1587
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,420
I will never tell her child this

1588
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,420
I will definitely make up for the red envelope first

1589
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,420
Maths questions can be done at any time

1590
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,420
Red envelope must be done first

1591
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,420
My child, you hurry up and talk

1592
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,420
Jingjing's first sentence is your red envelope

1593
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,420
Reward a set of five three

1594
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,420
Must be made up

1595
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,420
Ok

1596
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,420
I want to ask Liu Yining

1597
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,420
I heard you read the ten difficult subjects

1598
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,920
Why didn't you get the heart to promote in the last season?

1599
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,920
Do you have confidence in getting the heart to promote this season?

1600
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,920
Don't expect

1601
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,920
I have a chance

1602
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,920
Go back and watch ten more times

1603
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,920
Go back and watch ten more times

1604
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,920
Yes, yes, go back and cheer up

1605
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,920
We look forward to it

1606
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,920
Ok, no one has asked questions yet

1607
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,920
I want to ask Bai Yu

1608
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Everyone says you are a wild man

1609
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,920
Do you have anything to respond to this expression?

1610
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,920
Well said

1611
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,920
Yes, a little wild is quite good

1612
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,920
And then just in the interaction

1613
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,920
I feel that Liu Yining loves you very much

1614
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,920
No matter what you do to him, he loves you very much

1615
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,920
I love my brother very much

1616
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,920
Yes, I'm curious about what you did to him

1617
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,920
Make him fall in love with you

1618
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,920
No, no

1619
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,920
Sometimes it's just a feeling

1620
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,920
No reason

1621
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,920
The sense of trust between each other

1622
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,920
No, because Sidi is a good friend

1623
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,920
Sometimes we also talk about the weather

1624
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,920
Eat and eat

1625
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,920
Just talk a lot

1626
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Sidi, Sidi

1627
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
Take my love

1628
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Of course

1629
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
Ok, do you have any more questions?

1630
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,920
Let's ask

1631
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,920
I want to ask our manager, Jingjing

1632
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,920
As a newcomer to the show

1633
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,920
Did you prepare anything before recording?

1634
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,920
How can you become the center of attention

1635
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,420
I think I'm good at being myself

1636
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,420
Although I'm a newcomer, but recording with everyone

1637
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,420
Just like family

1638
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,420
But this episode really

1639
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,420
In the first two cases, there was a moment

1640
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,420
Just now that emotion was really on the line

1641
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,420
Just like everyone

1642
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,420
Just like this, very on the line

1643
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,420
There was a case, there was a moment

1644
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,420
It really made us feel

1645
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,420
It's like family

1646
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,420
I think it's a little bit like a family

1647
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,420
I think it's a little bit like a family

1648
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,420
I think it's a little bit like a family

1649
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,420
Like a family

1650
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,420
Yes, yes, yes

1651
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,420
Sacrificing for each other

1652
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,420
I remember you said to take care of my child

1653
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,420
Yes, yes, yes

1654
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,420
Just like this moment

1655
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,420
Yes, it's very emotional

1656
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,420
It's pretty good

1657
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,420
Really looking forward to our next episode

1658
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,420
Thank you for your questions

1659
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,420
Let's ask He Limo to stand in the middle of the stage

1660
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,420
Let's take a photo together

1661
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,420
Do you want to raise it? Don't raise it for me

1662
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,420
Thank you

1663
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,420
Is it finished?

1664
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,420
Very?

1665
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,420
Thank you He Limo

1666
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,420
Thank you to both users for their favorite trip to the same city

1667
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,420
The exclusive title is starting to be pushed to the third

1668
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,420
Explore the truth moment and the power that can't be hidden

1669
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,420
The trip to the same city can start together

1670
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,420
Hotel ticket, train ticket, door ticket

1671
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,420
Just book in the same city

1672
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,420
Thank you for your participation

1673
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,420
Thank you to the new residents for their help

1674
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,420
Thank you

1675
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,420
You have known so much about the atmosphere of推市

1676
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,420
You have already become a part of推市

1677
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,420
Today is just the beginning

1678
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,420
Let's meet in the depths of the fog

1679
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,420
Thank you for watching
