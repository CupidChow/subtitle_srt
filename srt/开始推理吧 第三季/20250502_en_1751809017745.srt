00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,860
Team Yes fer

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
The boss has a secret, right?

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
Only the boss can control the score.

4
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,120
But the boss is dead now.

5
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,200
It's possible that we are all here now.

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,760
Are you being broadcast live?

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,560
Yes.

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:21,440
You are being

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,280
The body of the boss.

10
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,760
Wait.

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,680
My room.

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,920
Is this a tunnel?

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,200
This is a prison.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,640
Move the body of the boss,

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,720
and unlock it with his fingerprints.

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,280
Yes.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,200
Burn it.

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,280
Let's go to the prison.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,320
Let's go.

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,720
Go.

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,200
You have to drink.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,920
Thank you.

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,000
Light.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,960
It's going to flash.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
Wait.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,080
Open the door.

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,200
It's so dark.

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,080
How can you see this?

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,160
Don't walk too fast.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,360
Is this a tunnel?

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm the security.

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,480
Can you pinch the fur on my clothes?

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,120
Just let me know that there is someone behind.

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,600
It seems to be a factory.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,360
This is a prison.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,960
This is a prison.

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,400
Prison.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,720
It's not a prison.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,360
It's not a prison.

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,880
The countdown of the live broadcast.

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,440
The live broadcast.

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,640
This is a live broadcast.

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
So scary.

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Oh my god.

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
This is a live broadcast room.

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,800
Please open the door.

47
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
Please start the broadcast.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
Okay.

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,360
Welcome to the live broadcast room.

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,880
Welcome.

51
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,720
Welcome.

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,280
Welcome.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,320
Welcome to

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,960
Xiao Fan's

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,000
live broadcast room.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,520
Welcome to

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,600
the very small live broadcast room.

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,320
Welcome to

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
the live broadcast room.

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,400
This is a live broadcast factory.

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,840
But they are a little bad.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
They don't let us go.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
Just force them to broadcast here.

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,440
We can't.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,640
Welcome to the live broadcast room.

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,120
Which star do you want to listen to?

67
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,480
Which star's live broadcast?

68
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,080
Are you familiar with this?

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,200
Do you want to listen to the Nine Girls?

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,280
Nine Girls.

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,520
They are very familiar.

72
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,440
I think they are good sisters.

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,880
Yes.

74
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,800
Recently,

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
there is a three-step-dance that is going to be released.

76
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,920
It's Qin Du's.

77
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Qin Du's.

78
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
The one who changed the line first.

79
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Now the live broadcast room

80
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,800
has already reached 30,000 people.

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
So the anchor

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,560
will give you a package of benefits.

83
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,640
I will give you

84
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
the latest flight number

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,720
of the Nine Girls.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
It's illegal.

87
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,240
It's really illegal.

88
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,760
I really serve you.

89
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,520
There is another benefit.

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
It's color-coded two-color blue.

91
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,720
I will give you

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,840
the phone number of his parents.

93
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
It's all illegal.

94
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,120
Do you dare to say it with your own name?

95
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,600
No.

96
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,280
He has to be responsible for the law.

97
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,880
Do you know the law of love?

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,560
The law of love.

99
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,600
If you love to eat,

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,480
I have

101
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,400
a little melon

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
to share with you.

103
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Really?

104
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,880
I want to eat.

105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,400
Shut up.

106
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,280
Do you want to feel

107
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,160
the muscle of our youth?

108
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,960
This is very handsome.

109
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Touch it.

110
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,240
I dare not touch it.

111
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,600
I'm really scared.

112
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,560
You can feel it.

113
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,440
You practiced really well.

114
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,080
You.

115
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
He asked me to touch it.

116
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,480
What does it mean?

117
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,960
This is not here.

118
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,520
Popp1 is back.

119
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,440
Upgraded to live broadcast.

120
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,040
What is this?

121
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,800
I don't understand.

122
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,440
So beautiful.

123
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
Sister Dating.

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
This is your sister.

125
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,840
Sister Dating.

126
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Sister Dating.

127
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Sister Dating.

128
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Sister Dating.

129
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Sister Dating.

130
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Sister Dating.

131
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Sister Dating.

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
My sister is dead.

133
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
She has jumped off the building.

134
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
My sister is dead.

135
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
She is dead?

136
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,800
What does it mean?

137
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,920
I have goosebumps.

138
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,280
What does it mean?

139
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,440
This is her sister.

140
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,440
She is alive.

141
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,680
Is this Sister Dating?

142
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,440
Sister.

143
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,320
Sister.

144
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,120
Sister.

145
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
She doesn't listen to you.

146
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
She can't talk to us.

147
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,920
She is dead.

148
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
But she is not dead.

149
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,160
That's right.

150
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,960
What's wrong?

151
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,720
Transformation.

152
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
She can do that?

153
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,640
Observe carefully to see if there is any clues on her.

154
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Handsome.

155
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
So scary.

156
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,720
She doesn't react.

157
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,760
She is...

158
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
She is not live now.

159
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
She is like this.

160
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,440
Yes.

161
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,760
Sister.

162
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,840
Using her powers?

163
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,520
Those six come here.

164
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,480

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,280
Sit down.

167
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,040
Sister.

168
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,040
Those six come here.

169
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
Sit down.

170
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Oh my god.

171
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,320
Those six come here.

172
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,920
Sit down.

173
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,160
There is a problem.

174
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
There must be some clues.

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,960
For those six to come here

176
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,600
and sit down.

177
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,200
Those six come here.

178
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Sit down

179
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
He said six people over there

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,760
Come and sit down

181
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,080
Welcome everyone to the business live room

182
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,400

I've seen this too

191
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,320
What does this mean

192
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,280
This kind of live room is very popular now

193
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,360
It's like someone gives a gift

194
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
He's the kind of person

195
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
who likes to be controlled

196
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,600
For example, you give me a gift

197
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
For example, Zhou Keyu gives me a gift

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,360
Right?

199
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,720
Thank you, Brother Keyu

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,200
Sit down

263
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840

265
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
He gave it to you

266
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
What?

267
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Why are you still

268
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840

269
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
He wrote you a love letter

We were all tricked to come to the live broadcast

271
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
You are too

272
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840

273
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
But if I help you directly

I don't understand

289
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Dr. He, hurry up

290
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
You are a good boy

291
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
This looks more than me

292
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
OK

293
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Wait a minute

294
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
There are many fans coming to the scene

295
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
No

296
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840

Help you to tie your tie

300
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
What's wrong, grandpa?

301
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Is there a game?

302
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Can I tie your tie?

303
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Yes

304
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
But I have a good Chinese doctor

305
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
His surname is He

306
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
I am He Suye

307
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840

No way

314
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
I am more reliable

315
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
This handsome guy

316
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
His face color

317
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
is a little yellow

318
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Yellow

319
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I also want to pull it for you

320
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840

Dangerous

325
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
You are very bad

326
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Your body is very bad

327
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Very bad

328
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
You can't talk nonsense

329
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
No

330
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
You belong to this kind of old age

331
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
And you often stay up late

332
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
You see, that's it

333
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Take care of your health

334
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
OK

335
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
You can adjust it

336
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
No problem

337
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Get your body together

338
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
OK

339
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
My god

340
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
The milk is stuck in my bones

341
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Look at the note

342
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Poor Sister Dating

343
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
My fans told me

344
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
that Wu Liang's boss was playing the piano

345
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
to make a fool

346
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
and found a fake body

347
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
that he committed suicide

348
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
So he is

349
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
My sister became a anchor

350
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
and made a lot of money

351
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Then she wanted to start her own business

352
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
and make a factory

353
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,840
She made the Tangxin moon cake

354
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Three years ago

355
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I saw her Tangxin moon cake

356
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
It was very well-sold

357
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
I saved a lot

358
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
and I bought a lot

359
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Then Tangxin moon cake

360
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
was found to be poisonous

361
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
One year

362
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I said this year is Mid-Autumn Festival

363
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
My sister asked the welfare center

364
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
I asked for some money

365
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
I asked for some budget

366
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
to buy moon cakes for you

367
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
So there is a child

368
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
who eats the poisonous moon cake

369
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Yes

370
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Sister Dating said that

371
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
the moon cake she made

372
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
was made by the boss

373
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
I want to change the company's legal person

374
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,840
to the partner of the goods I bring

375
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
If I receive the goods and eat something

376
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
it's also her fault

377
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,840
So she betrayed her

378
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
She was in prison for three years

379
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
and she was out of prison

380
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
But at this time

381
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
there was a bad news

382
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
that she jumped off the building

383
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
In fact, Sister Dating

384
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840
was kidnapped by Tangxin

385
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
into the live broadcast room here

386
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
and became Tangxin's

387
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840
violent

388
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
changed doll

389
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Your sister

390
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
So she became a mental illness

391
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
because she was forced

392
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
She was forced to become a scarecrow

393
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Everyone is being controlled

394
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Yes

395
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Right

396
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
It's Reba's costume

397
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
If you want to practice

398
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
the perfect abs

399
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
then move with the sad kids

400
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Today is the dance special of the ancient style

401
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Let's show the kids

402
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
the cards of today

403
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Our game rules today are

404
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
face to face

405
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Dad, I know everything

406
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Please help me out

407
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
It's a painful voice here

408
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm not like the six live broadcast teams

409
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
next door

410
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
One day, after entering the limited live broadcast

411
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
there is no news

412
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Six live broadcasts

413
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
So entering the limited live broadcast room

414
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
means that they are gone

415
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Upgraded to the limited live broadcast

416
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
High temperature is about to be taken away

417
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
What does it mean?

418
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,840
It's not necessarily a good thing to have heat here

419
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
There is no news after entering the limited live broadcast

420
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
High temperature is about to be taken away

421
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
High temperature is about to be taken away

422
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
It means that we have to do it

423
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
to the point that we can enter the next round

424
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
OK

425
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Get ready

426
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Get ready

427
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Get ready

428
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
It sounds like

429
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
It's so exaggerated

430
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Yes, it seems like

431
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
we are very good

432
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
It seems to be very good

433
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Here we go

434
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Here we go

435
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Please, the live broadcast system

436
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
We have to learn from them

437
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
We have to review their

438
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Look at this

439
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
OK

440
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Received a gift

441

442
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Hello, everyone. I'm Black Tiger

443
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
You do this

444
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840
No, it has to be a boy

445
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
The first one, I'll take it

446
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
I'm the first one

447
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
So fast

448
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Next

449
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Come on

450
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
OK, I'll do this

451
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
I'll do this

452
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
This is simpler

453
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
This

454
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
You don't know how to do it

455
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
I know it

456
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
You're practicing secretly, right?

457
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
I'll do this

458
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
OK

459
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
This is so difficult

460
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
OK

461
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
There are three left

462
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
This is done by six people

463
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
It's a dance

464
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Is it?

465
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Isn't this Younger?

466
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Younger

467
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Get up

468
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840
I'm afraid of the cold

469
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Then it's done

470
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
OK

471
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
It's OK

472
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
He said

473
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Black gold, black earth

474
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Don't you all wear black gold?

475
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Black gold clothes

476
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
OK, there are clothes here

477
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Let's change our clothes

478
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
His

479
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Yours

480
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
This is beautiful

481
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
I wear this

482
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Fans, we'll be back in a minute

483
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Bye

484
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
We're going to the night market

485
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
This picture is so beautiful

486
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
It's really good

487
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Yeah

488
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Let's go

489
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Let's go

490
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, go

491
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Catch up

492
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
OK

493
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
It's you

494
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
No, it's not the frame

495
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
I think it's the frame

496
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
It's the frame

497
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
It's the frame

498
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
It's the frame

499
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
It's the frame

500
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
It's the frame

501
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
It's not the frame going forward

502
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
I think it's enough

503
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
It's enough

504
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Come on, turn around

505
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Beautiful

506
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Your legs

507
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
I can't keep up with the rhythm

508
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
OK, let's get started

509
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
I'm Cui Biao

510
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Then I'm here

511
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Hello, everyone

512
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
We are

513
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840

Thank you

515
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Let's dance

516
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
I want to see

517
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,840
OK, let's show off a little talent

518
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
No, he's like this

519
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
We're going to interact with the comments

520
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
They'll give you a gift

521
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
And then what gift

522
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Decide which dance to dance

523
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
We're all down there

524
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
As long as you give us this corresponding gift

525
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
We can go up and dance

526
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
This is my dance

527
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
OK, no problem

I want to see us dancing

596
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Wait

597
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Someone's giving me a point

598
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Finally someone gave me a point

599
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
You'd better have music with him

600
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
It's up

601
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
Someone said

602
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
I have to hide this part

603
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Ok, it's going to make you black for the rest of your life

612
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840

Get ready

621
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840

629
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
I'm so familiar now

630
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Play the piano

631
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,840
I can't forget it if I keep dancing

632
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
I'm getting more and more familiar

I admit

637
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
That

638
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
I killed the one who played something

639
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Listen

640
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Today's home is all

641
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
I have

642
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Congratulations on the birth of the champion of this month

643
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
The champion is on the line

644
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Please go live

645
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
We are going to find a limited live broadcast room

646
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Then we can go directly

647
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Limited live broadcast room, go

648
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Yes, we have to go to the limited live broadcast room

649
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Let him pass by himself

650
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
He always has a pretty face on his face

651
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
Do something silly

652
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
The screen in front has changed

653
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Regular model

654
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Regular model

655
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
What does the snow flower screen mean?

656
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Is it our screen?

657
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Big screen control button

658
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
This is the most beautiful screen

659
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
The most beautiful screen

660
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
The most beautiful screen

661
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
The most beautiful screen

662
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
The most popular interactive group

663
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Jin Tang Shao and Bai Hanzi

664
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
What?

665
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
I want to send a gift to Jin Tang Shao and Bai Hanzi

666
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
I will protect my CP

667
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
We are the top one

668
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Yes

669
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
We already have a CP name

670
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
Old White Jin

671
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
We are so suitable

672
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Really?

673
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
I don't know, I just thought about it

674
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Just thought about it

675
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
The real chest is pressed

676
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
The real chest is pressed

677
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
What does this mean?

678
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
The real chest is pressed

679
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Wait a minute

680
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Does anyone know that we have someone killed?

681
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
So he saw it live and it was a murder

682
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
No, the video was closed at that time

683
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
I forgot to repair it at eight o'clock in the morning

684
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
The audience doesn't know who the killer is

685
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
But I know someone died

686
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Yes

687
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
I know this story

688
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
So you have to press

689
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Yes

690
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Who is the highest?

691
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Green, Jin Tang Shao

692
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
If you are the highest

693
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I think you have no problem

694
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Why?

695
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Why do you think he has no problem?

696
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
You shut me down

697
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Do you think I am the real chest?

698
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
He is the X I chose

699
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Then you can press the button

700
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Then you can press the X

701
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Then you can press the X

702
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
It's possible

703
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
The limited edition has been removed

704
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
The limited edition has been removed

705
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Go

706
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
When you were ranking just now

707
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Why didn't you say anything?

708
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
I just observed you

709
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
It's open

710
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Come on, let's go

711
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
The elevator

712
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
What does it mean?

713
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
It's an elevator, right?

714
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
This is it again

715
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
It's a good elevator

716
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Yes, it will move

717
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
It should move

718
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
The owner has not received the secret key

719
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,840
This transport cannot follow the original route

720
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Go to the owner's office

721
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
What does it mean?

722
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Go to the owner's office

723
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
It's moving

724
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,840
We are here

725
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
It's open

726
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
I thought there was a key

727
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
The delivery warehouse is starting

728
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
The delivery warehouse is starting

729
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
The button is not set to the destination

730
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,840
The delivery warehouse will return to the office

731
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
The secret room is in the second-floor live room

732
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
Normally the boss will decide

733
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Where to transport this person

734
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
For example, where to transport

735
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
As long as he doesn't specify

736
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Just send it to his room

737
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
So the boss is dead

738
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
No one is specified

739
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
We just go

740
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Let's find a way to specify

741
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Send us to the limited live room

742
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Yes

743
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,840
We should find one in the boss's office

744
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Where we insert the key

745
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Decide us to go to the limited live room

746
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Do we need to take it?

747
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
Come on, take one each

748
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Go

749
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
This is it

750
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
This is the cabinet

751
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
This is different

752
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
The keyhole is different

753
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
You are the little one

754
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Can you insert it?

755
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
It's cool

756
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Boss

757
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Boss

758
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Brother Deng's number

759
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
There's something here

760
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Wait a minute

761
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Come on, take it out

762
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Take it all out

763
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
This thing is called

764
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
The photo simulator

765
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
It's a new mobile phone for all employees

766
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
And simulate the real friend's message

767
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
It's automatically sent at any time

768
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
According to the demand of the bulletin

769
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
And that message is sent by them

770
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Yes

771
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Yes

772
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Do you have a lot of people

773
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Don't know that you have sent these messages

774
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
You don't know

775
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
What you said

776
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Right?

777
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
I don't remember

778
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Good guy

779
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Wait a minute

780
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Our car room is actually a live broadcast room

781
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,840
Our hidden candy hidden live broadcast

782
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
Here comes the hidden

783
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Find a bunch of ignorant workers

784
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Ignorant

785
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Ignorant

786
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Ignorant

787
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Who are you talking about

788
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Ignorant workers

789
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Come on, do an ignorant action

790
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
It looks like it's suitable for the game

791
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
To create for them

792
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
It's a real fake

793
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Secretly installed camera

794
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
The whole party secretly took pictures of their life

795
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
According to the audience's reward

796
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
To them

797
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
To create for them

798
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,840
It's a real fake

799
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Secretly installed camera

800
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
The whole party secretly took pictures of their life

801
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
Real people show

802
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
According to the audience's reward

803
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
To them

804
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
The total profit is 20,000

805
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
The total profit is 50,000

806
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Can change different themes

807
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
The value of the background increases

808
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Everyone

809
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
Every day's live broadcast income

810
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Becomes our salary

811
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Then we have to restrict our activities on the first floor

812
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Can't let us find out

813
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
This is a scam

814
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
But you've already found out

815
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
There is a very suspicious person outside

816
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Not our Tang Ming's staff

817
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,840
But he's transporting our goods

818
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Our factory is actually working fake

819
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
You found out

820
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
So after being caught by Tan Qian

821
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
He must kill you

822
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
You are to save your life

823
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
So kill him

824
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Where did you get this?

825
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
I thought of it

826
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Smart, I'm not a ignorant worker

827
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
No

828
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
What did I find?

829
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
I didn't find the rules of the live broadcast

830
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
What did you find?

831
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
The process of making the candy is fake

832
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
Yes, just gold

833
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
He's going to kill you

834
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,840
Because this is a huge profit chain

835
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Don't pretend

836
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Don't pretend

837
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Don't pretend

838
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,840
You didn't fight with him

839
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Just now, this one is already weak

840
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Really

841
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
No

842
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
He found out

843
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
It's not that

844
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
You have to be careful

845
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
I'm so bad

846
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
You have to be careful

847
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
You have to be careful

848
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
You have to be careful

849
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
You have to be careful

850
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
You have to be careful

851
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
Not really

852
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
You don't have to mention the excuse

853
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
You X, you immediately have an excuse

854
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Bai, you are too obvious

855
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
I'm telling the truth

856
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Really not really

857
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
He won't play like that

858
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
He won't protect the murderer if he becomes X

859
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Yes, that's right

860
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
I won't

861
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
But let me tell you

862
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
The excuse just now is too weak

863
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Because I was so quick

864
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
He said

865
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
You are suspicious

866
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Don't pretend

867
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
He is so hardworking

868
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
He is

869
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
You are so good

870
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
He is so weak

871
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
And he doesn't know what to say

872
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
He is anxious

873
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
And he needs to be calm

874
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
The entangled feeling

875
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
First of all, it doesn't matter if you are the murderer

876
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
But you must be the public servant of the public

877
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Let's blackmail them later

878
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
What is this?

879
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Live backstage data

880
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
It should be today's

881
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
From six o'clock to eight o'clock

882
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Because it's disconnected

883
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
So it's not

884
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Yes

885
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Can you see the record of the cut wood?

886
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Can you see this?

887
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Finally, the cut wood is over

888
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
My first game is eight o'clock

889
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Finally, the live broadcast has started

890
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
A stranger came to do it

891
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
What is he doing?

892
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
The stranger he said

893
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
It should be the one who ran out

894
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Three gold coins

895
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
The gold coin gift is so funny

896
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Did they come to scare us with money?

897
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Why are these employees today

898
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
All weird

899
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
It's almost the same

900
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
I think the He Ni class is so handsome

901
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
I think so too

902
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
I think so too

903
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
But the day before yesterday, He Ni Pa was at the door of the dorm

904
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
He looked like a documentary

905
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,840
To you

906
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
He Ni Pa is not like that

907
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
I want to see how handsome he is on the live broadcast

908
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
It's true that he is in love with him

909
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
To be honest

910
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
No one thinks that the white man just

911
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
Just like that

912
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
I think

913
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
I'll give you 100 yuan

914
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
The white man is really charming

915
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
I like him so much

916
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
I want to look at him again

917
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Is he handsome and beautiful?

918
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Is that brother's handsome brother a light bulb?

919
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Or didn't come out of the song of the light bulb

920
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
So moving

921
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,840
The shooting star is still coming

922
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
My main song

923
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
The killer

924
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
So weak

925
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
We are all the actors

926
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Right

927
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
A sense of ritual

928
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Come on, a sense of ritual

929
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
I have a bad nose

930
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
Boss, you're dead

931
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
It's too sudden

932
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
This plot must be very exciting

933
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
What a pity

934
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Stopped before eight

935
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Stopped before eight

936
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Otherwise, you can see their live broadcast killing people

937
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
No

938
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Come on, next week

939
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Today's live broadcast is crazy

940
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Next week, next week

941
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Read some

942
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
I have a suspect

943
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Three days ago, Jin Kangsheng

944
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
He was rolling around in the kitchen

945
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
I kept looking at him

946
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
I thought he was abnormal

947
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
There must be a secret

948
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Then I suspect Ba Ben Tang

949
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
I saw him two days ago

950
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
He was reading the password in the kitchen

951
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Did he find something?

952
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
But there is key information

953
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
You are reading the password

954
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
Yes

955
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Go down

956
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Look at the bottom

957
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
No

958
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
No

959
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Your word is suspicious

960
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,840
What are you looking at in the kitchen?

961
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
I'm looking at the boss's password

962
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
You look at the boss's password

963
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Kitchen

964
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Ba Ben Tang is also testing the password in the delivery bag

965
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
We didn't

966
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Yes

967
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
So he may have tested the password

968
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Found that one

969
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
Rolled back

970
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I've never tested the password

971
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Never

972
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Never

973
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
The password is the same

974
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,840
We need to check who has the motive

975
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
and time

976
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
You know the motive

977
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
All of you know the motive

978
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Because he jumped off the building

979
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
I think it's very suspicious

980
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Could he

981
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,840
be the one who pushed my sister down the building

982
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
and pulled her bracelet

983
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
between the push-up

984
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
when she pushed my sister down the building

985
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
I grew up in Tuitu Village welfare home

986
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
There was a kid

987
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
He was called Ba Ben Tang

988
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
There was a kid

989
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
He was called Xiaoman Tou

990
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
He loved my steamed buns the most

991
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
I said this Mid-Autumn Festival

992
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
I'll buy you mooncakes

993
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
So there was a kid

994
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
who ate the poisonous mooncake

995
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Yes

996
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
When I went there, I found that

997
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,840
our factory was actually in Jia Yun

998
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
At that time, when he was on the big sister's live broadcast

999
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
the mooncake that came out

1000
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
was made by the boss

1001
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
So he owed money outside

1002
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
He found out the company's secret

1003
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
and used the secret to threaten the boss

1004
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
I threatened the boss is the fact

1005
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
But I threatened the boss to save him

1006
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
not because of myself

1007
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,840
I have a dream of becoming a game master since I was a child

1008
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
The club replied to me

1009
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
He wanted to give me a video call

1010
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
So I secretly took my phone

1011
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
when I was working

1012
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,840
At that time, the boss thought I was shooting a video

1013
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
But actually I was on the phone

1014
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
with my club

1015
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
He has a condition

1016
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
that is to say, if you want to come to my club

1017
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
to work

1018
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
you can't have any personal legal disputes

1019
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
with this player

1020
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
So you killed the boss

1021
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
because you owed him one million

1022
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Yes

1023
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
We can be sure that

1024
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
the time of the murderer's crime

1025
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
is on the 25th

1026
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
from 6.30 am to 8 am

1027
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Yes

1028
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
When the live broadcast was stopped

1029
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
How did the murderer commit the crime?

1030
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
He must have entered the restaurant

1031
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
when I went to deliver breakfast

1032
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
He entered the restaurant

1033
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,840
and walked to the work area through the delivery bag

1034
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,840
After giving the boss a hammer

1035
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,840
he quickly returned to his own life

1036
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
No

1037
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
The paper on the bottom of the second floor of the boss

1038
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,840
It said that the boss would only come down to pick up breakfast every day

1039
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
No one gave him food

1040
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
I think the place where the boss was murdered

1041
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
should be in the delivery bag of the restaurant

1042
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
the place where the delivery bag of the food was taken

1043
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
He went to that place

1044
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
After he killed the boss there

1045
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
he put his body on the floor

1046
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
and followed the man who was sliding

1047
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
He didn't have to carry it

1048
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
At that time

1049
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
the body was walking this way

1050
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
and he walked outside

1051
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
He walked like this

1052
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
and went straight over there

1053
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
to pick up the body

1054
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
No way

1055
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
No way

1056
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Why?

1057
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Because the door letter would show

1058
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
There is no record of the door

1059
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,840
He could have slipped with the boss

1060
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
It could be

1061
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
What are you talking about?

1062
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,840
I think the point where the boss picked up the food is very important

1063
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Yes, I was thinking just now

1064
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
When we went there for the first time

1065
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
the door of the door of the restaurant

1066
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
couldn't be opened

1067
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
The door inside

1068
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Yes

1069
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
Is it open?

1070
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
It can't be opened

1071
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
The village chief must have waited

1072
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,840
for the boss to pick up the breakfast when he was going to deliver it

1073
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
He opened it

1074
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,840
and went in to kill the boss

1075
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
So the boss picked up the food at what time is important

1076
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
Yes

1077
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
I don't know about this

1078
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
It's like this

1079
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
He killed this man at seven o'clock

1080
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Right?

1081
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,840
He died at seven o'clock

1082
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
His case can only be after six fifty-seven

1083
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,840
Because before six fifty-seven

1084
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
I was always in the canteen

1085
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,840
The case time is only two to three minutes

1086
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
When you left the kitchen

1087
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,840
he knew that the boss would come to pick it up at seven o'clock

1088
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,840
There was not enough time

1089
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840
If the track wanted to transport the body

1090
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
we would all take the track

1091
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
This is called meditation channel

1092
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
I sat on the track

1093
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
I thought why it took so long

1094
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Why so long

1095
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
I sat on the track for about three minutes

1096
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I said meditation

1097
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Do you remember?

1098
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Yes

1099
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Can we measure it?

1100
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
How many minutes?

1101
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
No problem

1102
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
No problem

1103
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
OK

1104
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Now we can check

1105
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
OK

1106
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Wait for me here

1107
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Can you?

1108
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
You are so young

1109
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
How old are you?

1110
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
How old are you?

1111
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Now I am older

1112
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
I will help you time

1113
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Come on

1114
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Three, two, one, go

1115
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
It's out

1116
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,840
Two minutes and forty-five seconds

1117
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
OK, I got it

1118
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
We should go back first

1119
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
Don't let others catch us

1120
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Come on

1121
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Let's count the time line first

1122
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,840
I went to wash at six fifty-five

1123
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
I came out in about three minutes

1124
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
I saw He Ni Ba

1125
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Six fifty-seven

1126
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
I am sending you breakfast

1127
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Now it's Jin Ba He

1128
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Ba He

1129
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Six fifty-eight

1130
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Now it's He He Ke, right?

1131
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,840
You two are here

1132
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,840
So your time is only two minutes

1133
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
We have three minutes

1134
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
The time to deliver the bag

1135
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,840
It's already two minutes and forty-five seconds

1136
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Right?

1137
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,840
Yes

1138
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
So our two minutes

1139
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
It's basically impossible

1140
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
So actually they two

1141
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Just line up

1142
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Yes

1143
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
It's me and Ba, right?

1144
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
That's one of us

1145
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
That Ba

1146
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
I

1147
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
That's very clear

1148
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Three minutes is not enough

1149
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
I want to ask

1150
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Three minutes

1151
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Just deliver the bag

1152
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
It takes so long

1153
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Then put it on the road

1154
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Can't do it

1155
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
Why?

1156
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Can't do it

1157
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Because our delivery

1158
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
It's two minutes and forty-five seconds

1159
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,840
I met Ba at the end

1160
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
It's a girl's dorm

1161
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
We ran from the girl's dorm to the canteen

1162
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
Open the delivery door and go in

1163
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Then go down

1164
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Then it's definitely too late

1165
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Only three minutes is not enough at all

1166
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
It seems that everyone's time

1167
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
It's not that full

1168
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
Yes

1169
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,840
If you can't make it at seven o'clock

1170
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
How did he shoot the video?

1171
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Self-shoot

1172
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
No, brother

1173
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Why are you still talking about cold jokes?

1174
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
How did you shoot the video?

1175
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Can you make a fake?

1176
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
What's this?

1177
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
What's this?

1178
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,840
Look, this is hot pot

1179
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
The dorm is the dungeon

1180
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
After special effects

1181
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Yes

1182
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
For example, do you understand?

1183
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
No, do you know what these represent?

1184
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
The background of that video

1185
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
It may be cut off

1186
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
He's wearing a green cloth

1187
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
He's wearing a green cloth

1188
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
The place where he died in the video

1189
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,840
It's not where we found him

1190
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
All of his backgrounds

1191
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,840
It's all through the green cloth

1192
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
Can be replaced anywhere

1193
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
The room just now was a canteen

1194
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Now it's become this

1195
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,840
What crystal floor and so on

1196
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
Yes

1197
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,840
The most direct thing about this thing

1198
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,840
It can point to the video on the phone

1199
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
It can be fake

1200
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,840
OK

1201
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
The video can also be replaced

1202
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,840
You see

1203
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Look carefully at this video

1204
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,840
The boss died stubbornly

1205
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
No

1206
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840
Look at this box here

1207
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
It's a needle

1208
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,840
There are traces of decoding

1209
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
Did you see it?

1210
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,840
So it means the boss

1211
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
It's not necessarily hammered there

1212
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,840
Yes

1213
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
He may be in

1214
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Who else?

1215
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
Yes

1216
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
It's the wrong way

1217
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Yes

1218
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,840
I can die in the street

1219
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Where he died

1220
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
There are time-travelling bodies behind

1221
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
As long as he dies

1222
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
That time is seven o'clock

1223
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
After seven o'clock

1224
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Anytime

1225
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
Yes

1226
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
After sending the video

1227
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
From seven to seven fifty-five

1228
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
The time in the middle

1229
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
We didn't see each other

1230
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
There is no time to move

1231
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
It's only eight o'clock

1232
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
It's only eight o'clock

1233
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
To shoot a video

1234
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
You see

1235
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
There's a long time after that

1236
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
It's called green wood

1237
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Or the same space

1238
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,840
You can take a video of that

1239
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
We have green wood everywhere

1240
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Isn't there a bunch of green boxes

1241
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,840
Outside the door of the boat?

1242
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
What do you mean?

1243
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,840
What do you mean?

1244
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,840
Kill in the boat

1245
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,840
Let's go to the boat and have a look

1246
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Go

1247
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
Go and have a look

1248
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
No need to go

1249
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
It's green outside

1250
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,840
It's all green

1251
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
There is white on it

1252
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,840
Here

1253
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,840
It's the same

1254
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,840
It's the same

1255
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,840
It's here

1256
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,840
The same in the basement

1257
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,840
Don't explain too much

1258
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
Jin Tang Chao

1259
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
This is the best place to finish

1260
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
You just locked me

1261
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
Why?

1262
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
Fifty-seven points

1263
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,840
I'm giving you breakfast

1264
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
I know

1265
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,840
I know

1266
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,840
Not him

1267
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
No, listen to me

1268
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,840
Three thirty

1269
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,840
To six

1270
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,840
Fifty-seven

1271
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,840
You're having breakfast here

1272
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,840
Yes

1273
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,840
The three of us can't

1274
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,840
Come to you and do the case

1275
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,840
Of course not

1276
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,840
Then six fifty-seven

1277
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
You went back after the meal

1278
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Yes

1279
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
But the video was taken at seven

1280
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Although this video was taken

1281
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,840
But the time at seven is right

1282
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,840
Yes

1283
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,840
The person came after I left

1284
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,840
He is the one

1285
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,840
He is the one

1286
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
He is the one

1287
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
The person came after me

1288
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840
He is the one

1289
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,840
Yes

1290
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,840
You left after you left

1291
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
And I have a highlight

1292
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,840
I must say

1293
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Everyone knows

1294
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,840
I will leave here at six fifty-seven

1295
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,840
To deliver breakfast

1296
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Yes, it doesn't matter

1297
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,840
Highlight

1298
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
Yes

1299
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,840
Highlight

1300
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,840
Amazing

1301
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Highlight

1302
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,840
Because you left at fifty-seven

1303
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,840
Only three minutes

1304
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,840
Shower and video

1305
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
Just these two

1306
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Yes

1307
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
No problem

1308
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Because you didn't rush to send it

1309
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
No, I'll do it later

1310
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
Yes

1311
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,840
I'll do it later

1312
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Yes

1313
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,840
I think he fainted first

1314
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,840
The boss was fainted

1315
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,840
Does he have any symptoms

1316
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
No, how did he faint

1317
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,840
We don't know how he fainted

1318
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,840
Is there anything else

1319
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,840
I didn't find

1320
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
Let's go find it together

1321
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Let's start from the hall

1322
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,840
Go

1323
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,840
What is it

1324
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
Can make him faint

1325
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,840
It's fainted

1326
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,840
Or it's the sugar

1327
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,840
Let's find it

1328
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Is there anything

1329
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,840
See what's in this basket

1330
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,840
I'll have to take it apart in the future

1331
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,840
OK, I'm going to start taking it apart

1332
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Is it in these barrels

1333
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,840
Some barrels are empty

1334
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,840
Some are sugar

1335
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,840
What is this

1336
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,840
Sugar

1337
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Is it sugar

1338
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
Is there anything in the sugar

1339
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
Is there anything in the sugar

1340
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,840
Do you want to stir it

1341
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,840
The one in my security guard

1342
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,840
There is a simple way

1343
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Pour it over

1344
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
Look here

1345
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,840
There is something in it

1346
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
Just pour it here

1347
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
Look inside and see if there is something in it

1348
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
Come on, let's serve

1349
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,840
Come on, let's do it together

1350
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,840
Niu Mei White Fitness

1351
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
Is there anything

1352
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
Yes, there is a brick

1353
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
Wait a minute

1354
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,840
It's fainted

1355
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,840
Open it

1356
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,840
What is it

1357
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,840
Mobile phone instruction book

1358
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,840
This mobile phone can be set up and run

1359
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,840
Two separate operating systems

1360
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,840
Two operating systems can be set up separately

1361
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,840
Different lock screen password

1362
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Enter different passwords

1363
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,840
Can enter the corresponding system

1364
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
The one written by Bian is called

1365
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
It is called a strong sleep spray

1366
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
It's fainted

1367
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
Their words

1368
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,840
After the spray is absorbed

1369
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,840
A few people are in a state of deep sleep

1370
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,840
Deep sleep state

1371
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,840
It can last at least six hours

1372
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
The colorless liquid

1373
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,840
If it touches the wall

1374
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
It will turn purple in an hour

1375
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,840
No

1376
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,840
Find the purple on the wall

1377
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,840
Go to the restaurant

1378
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,840
I'm going out to see

1379
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Go

1380
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,840
Is there

1381
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,840
This doesn't have to be a big fire

1382
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
I found something

1383
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,840
Really

1384
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,840
It's a password

1385
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
After opening 1818

1386
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,840
It's another system

1387
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,840
Here

1388
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
Here

1389
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
This place

1390
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,840
It means

1391
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,840
Is it sprayed here

1392
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,840
Golden sugar spoon

1393
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
If I'm the boss

1394
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
I'm here to pick vegetables

1395
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,840
I'm here to pick vegetables for Mr. Jin

1396
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,840
He might be at seven o'clock

1397
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,840
What

1398
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,840
I know it's not necessarily him

1399
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,840
No

1400
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,840
I know it's here

1401
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,840
I know it's here

1402
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
You've been helping him

1403
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,840
Stop talking

1404
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,840
Wait a minute

1405
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,840
He's been licking

1406
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,840
His boyfriend has been licking me

1407
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,840
From what we said three minutes ago

1408
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,840
He's been licking since then

1409
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,840
Come in first

1410
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
Wait a minute

1411
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Just now

1412
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Didn't we find this thing just now

1413
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
It says on the top

1414
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
This phone can be set up

1415
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
And run two separate systems

1416
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,840
When I first saw this password

1417
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
It's 8888

1418
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,840
Because we're in his office

1419
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,840
There's a medicine flower

1420
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,840
Medicine flower, medicine flower

1421
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,840
Isn't that 1818

1422
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,840
1818

1423
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,840
So after you open it

1424
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,840
Enter another system

1425
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,840
There's a green wood assistant

1426
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,840
That's right

1427
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,840
And then there's a picture book here

1428
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
There's a picture in it

1429
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,840
The crime scene

1430
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
A background he made

1431
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,840
Yes, he just needs to put the boss

1432
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,840
Use the green wood

1433
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,840
Take it out

1434
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,840
Put this person here

1435
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,840
Is that so, golden sugar spoon

1436
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,840
Yes

1437
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,840
Thank you

1438
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,840
You've been watching

1439
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,840
I think it's too obvious

1440
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,840
He must be waiting

1441
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,840
When he was going to deliver breakfast

1442
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,840
The boss was there to pick up the breakfast

1443
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,840
He turned it on

1444
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,840
Put the boss

1445
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
The fate first

1446
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,840
A hammer

1447
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,840
It's a bit of a hit

1448
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,840
After 6 57

1449
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,840
Between 8

1450
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,840
All the time is okay

1451
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,840
All the time

1452
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,840
The four of us are possible

1453
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
But now as long as he's too much

1454
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,840
I don't think it's very similar

1455
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
OK, so now we're going to

1456
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
Take all the evidence we've found

1457
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
And then we'll go to that room

1458
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
Let's discuss it

1459
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
OK

1460
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,840
OK, I think in my heart

1461
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
The four of us are equal

1462
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,840
In my opinion

1463
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,840
The important point is

1464
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,840
He has to know

1465
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,840
That

1466
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,840
Boss

1467
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,840
That's right

1468
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,840
I know what you're thinking

1469
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,840
I think this is very important too

1470
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
This is very important

1471
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
I think

1472
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,840
Actually, there's one thing

1473
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,840
I've always thought he was motivated

1474
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
Not motivated

1475
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,840
He's not like a suspect

1476
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
Why?

1477
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
It's just you see

1478
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
The four of us

1479
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,840
Still in the 57th minute

1480
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,840
The murderer

1481
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
Why did he have to be at 7 o'clock

1482
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
To shoot that video

1483
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,840
Is it just to do it

1484
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,840
Do it yourself without proof

1485
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Yes

1486
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,840
So I'm just

1487
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
I just wanted to analyze

1488
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
The four of us

1489
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Do it together

1490
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,840
The point of not proving

1491
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,840
You see, we two

1492
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,840
It's 58 minutes

1493
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,840
He came out of the bathroom

1494
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,840
I went into the bathroom

1495
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
I met him

1496
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,840
He was very active

1497
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,840
He was

1498
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
He came out after taking a shower

1499
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,840
He didn't say I had to be here

1500
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
Let no one see

1501
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,840
You hit him

1502
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,840
So it can't be him

1503
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Yes, it can't be him

1504
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,840
Yes, because I don't know who

1505
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,840
When will it appear in the corridor

1506
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,840
So his suspicion is relatively low

1507
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,840
Yes, I agree with him

1508
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,840
Anyway, here

1509
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,840
The security guard is the cleanest

1510
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,840
In my opinion

1511
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,840
I think the most important thing is

1512
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,840
He has to know

1513
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,840
The environment we are in

1514
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
He is the only one

1515
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,840
Who knows our factory

1516
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,840
Not a real factory

1517
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
You're going to explore

1518
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,840
What are we doing

1519
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
Know this live broadcast company

1520
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
Live broadcast company

1521
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,840
And the green screen

1522
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,840
Maybe you all know

1523
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Yes

1524
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
Green screen should be

1525
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,840
A very important point

1526
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
So he knows this

1527
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,840
I really suspect him now

1528
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,840
I'm very

1529
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,840
I suspect him very much

1530
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,840
Why

1531
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,840
Why

1532
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,840
I'm in the bathroom at 55

1533
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,840
I washed in it

1534
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,840
About three minutes

1535
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,840
When I came out

1536
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,840
I met him in the corridor

1537
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,840
Where did he go

1538
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,840
I didn't see it

1539
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
No, there's a question

1540
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,840
You two have been together for a while

1541
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,840
It's the time when you didn't see each other

1542
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,840
So I think

1543
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,840
I think it's a little bit

1544
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
I think

1545
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,840
It's a little bit

1546
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,840
I think

1547
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,840
I think

1548
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,840
I think

1549
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,840
He's not in the bathroom

1550
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,840
He's not in the bathroom

1551
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840
So he didn't go to the bathroom

1552
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,840
I can only say I doubt

1553
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,840
You said you had seen him

1554
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,840
It was coincidentally at 57

1555
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,840
When you bring food

1556
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
So it's him

1557
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,840
The connection that's blocking you to deliver food

1558
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,840
After blocking you to deliver food

1559
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,280
He doesn't know where he is for the past 12 minutes

1560
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,360
Let me tell you, as a roommate

1561
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,040
I know your life habits

1562
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,440
I probably know you're almost done

1563
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,360
I'll be out

1564
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,760
I'm going to wash up

1565
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,280
Come back for breakfast after washing up

1566
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,480
This is a normal life

1567
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,200
We're the same height

1568
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,880
The same body shape

1569
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,560
I wash for three minutes

1570
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,520
You wash for 12 minutes

1571
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,240
You guys are clean

1572
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,160
You guys are clean

1573
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,280
You're clean, aren't you?

1574
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,560
I love selfies

1575
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,000
I want to take a picture of my

1576
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,120
eight-pack

1577
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,000
I want to show my muscles

1578
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,480
Then you take the selfies

1579
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,040
I want to take

1580
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,880
Take the selfies

1581
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,720
If there are no photos

1582
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,240
That's a false certificate

1583
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,360
Look at this place

1584
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,200
Jin Ba He He Ke

1585
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,240
Only this person is overlapping

1586
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,560
In all of us

1587
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,360
In our eyes

1588
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,400
Do you know why?

1589
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,080
Because we shouldn't have met

1590
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,320
I think you're the one who was hit by me

1591
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,760
That's a blow to the head

1592
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,480
Let me tell you

1593
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,800
I went to the bathroom to wash up at 55

1594
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,880
He doesn't know when I can come out

1595
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,760
This person is unable to determine

1596
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,320
When I can make this

1597
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,000
Coincidence

1598
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,800
He has one thing to be sure about

1599
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,880
It's time for Jin Tang Shao to send food

1600
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,720
6 57

1601
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,400
Jin Tang Shao did see him

1602
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,640
Today, my brother

1603
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,520
Give him a big credit

1604
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,120
Zhou Ke Lan

1605
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,080
Don't get involved

1606
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,880
Don't be led away

1607
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,040
I'm just talking about my idea

1608
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,480
I tell you

1609
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,680
You can think I have

1610
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,360
Very big suspicion

1611
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,800
But they two

1612
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,160
They're both in the potential

1613
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,400
Much bigger than us

1614
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:08,840
So

1615
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,920
His reasoning

1616
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,520
I think there's no problem

1617
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,200
But at the same time

1618
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,480
Don't ignore him, okay?

1619
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,560
Otherwise, at this point

1620
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,480
Choose to lock him up alone

1621
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,560
I think it's a little unfair

1622
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,880
Why is it unfair?

1623
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,800
What's not fair

1624
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,560
What's not fair about this

1625
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,440
Other people are also suspicious

1626
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,520
Why is he your son or something

1627
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,400
What's not fair

1628
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,160
What's not fair about your son or something

1629
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,920
Yes

1630
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,760
He's my ex

1631
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,240
He's my ex

1632
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,880
I'm speechless

1633
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,720
It means we're getting close

1634
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,640
If we keep playing, we'll lock people up

1635
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,120
Understand?

1636
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,320
Don't be too relaxed

1637
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,200
You will regret it

1638
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,000
You will regret it

1639
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,040
Will I regret it?

1640
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,880
Who do you think it is?

1641
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,040
Between them

1642
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,520
I can only choose one

1643
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,960
This murderer is going to be a case

1644
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,600
Do you have to know

1645
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,040
When the boss will be

1646
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,000
You can meet this boss

1647
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,280
Yes, you have to know

1648
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,640
You have to know

1649
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,160
Then who of us four

1650
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,600
Who is most likely to know

1651
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,560
Me

1652
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,360
Of course it's you

1653
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,440
I think now

1654
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,280
The suspicion in my heart is more serious

1655
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,000
According to the motivation

1656
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,400
I think we two have the most motivation

1657
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,360
Because we have the direct death case on our back

1658
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,320
My sister is dead

1659
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,120
She has jumped off the building

1660
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,880
So your purpose of coming here is to investigate

1661
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,480
Yes

1662
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,000
Little steamed buns

1663
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,600
She loves my steamed buns the most

1664
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,840
So there is a child

1665
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,040
Eat that moon cake

1666
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,680
Yes

1667
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,760
I've been investigating this matter

1668
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,720
Yes

1669
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,160
I just pushed another time

1670
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:38,800
Intentionally made

1671
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,000
He sat there

1672
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,200
Wait for me to send food at 57

1673
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,600
OK

1674
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,480
This suspect

1675
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,800
You two are in there

1676
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,360
6.57

1677
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,280
I'm sending you breakfast

1678
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,040
At this time

1679
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,800
It's 8.00

1680
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,640
At this time

1681
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,160
Three people have time to prove

1682
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,880
Yes

1683
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,880
So different circles

1684
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,120
Different circles are interlocked

1685
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,280
8 is always inside

1686
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,400
So in my heart

1687
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,560
I think 8 is more serious

1688
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,120
OK, it's OK

1689
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,400
Lv Mu

1690
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,800
I think it's this

1691
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,320
People who know this should act

1692
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,760
But Sister Bafengtang

1693
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,200
I've been on the air before

1694
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,320
So she has this logic

1695
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,960
Found that this is a huge live broadcast

1696
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,760
It makes sense

1697
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,760
Then you use this method to kill my sister

1698
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,520
I'll let you feel like you're always changing your mind

1699
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,360
Feel

1700
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,320
Yes

1701
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,320
They were talking

1702
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,480
They were talking

1703
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,680
Can you pay attention

1704
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,800
I'm talking to everyone

1705
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,520
We're talking to each other

1706
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,000
No

1707
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,120
When she was talking to us

1708
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,800
They were talking to each other

1709
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,520
Can you pay attention to this

1710
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,560
But I don't think

1711
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,560
The murderer of X and X

1712
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,040
It's not that obvious

1713
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,080
Because you didn't find it

1714
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,880
I'm the only one watching

1715
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,400
Because I'm

1716
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,400
You've been following me all the time

1717
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,200
As long as I'm with someone

1718
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,800
You're uncomfortable

1719
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,280
There's no reason

1720
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,760
It's possible

1721
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,120
A sudden love story

1722
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,600
He said you were a man

1723
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,320
I have someone to choose

1724
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,080
I have someone to choose

1725
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,200
Who do you want to vote for

1726
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,960
Who do you say you want to vote for

1727
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,160
One of them

1728
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,520
We should agree

1729
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,080
So

1730
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,240
If you and my sister

1731
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:25,880
Are brothers

1732
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,120
Let him first

1733
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,540
Brother He

1734
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,440
Hei Niber

1735
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,200
All these things

1736
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,480
I know

1737
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,360
Seize them

1738
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,000
I believe

1739
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,200
The person must be brothers

1740
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,200
I think the mystery is more serious after a series of cases

1741
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,200
I hope it's right

1742
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,200
The biggest suspect is me

1743
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,200
Today, the real murderer is

1744
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
The murderer I chose is

1745
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,200
8 points

1746
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,200
His motive is that he found out the truth after he sneaked into the office

1747
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,200
So he killed Tan Dada

1748
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,200
To avenge his sister

1749
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
I think he has a motive for the case

1750
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,200
He also knows the secret

1751
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,200
I think he is the most suspicious

1752
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
I'm so nervous

1753
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,200
Among the suspects of today's case

1754
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
Three people got votes

1755
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,200
Three people?

1756
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,200
One player got two votes

1757
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Another player got one vote

1758
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,200
Besides

1759
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,200
Another player got three votes

1760
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
Three votes

1761
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,200
Three votes

1762
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
Three votes

1763
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,200
Three votes

1764
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,200
The first player got four votes

1765
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,200
Four votes

1766
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
You got two votes

1767
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
I'm dead

1768
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
I can get two votes with this vote

1769
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,200
This card can't fall into his hands

1770
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,200
It's over

1771
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
That's the truth

1772
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
Dead

1773
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
Seven votes

1774
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,200
The first player who got zero votes is

1775
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,200
Ke'an Kan

1776
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,200
And then?

1777
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,200
The player who got two votes is

1778
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,200
8 points

1779
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
He Niba

1780
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,200
I got two votes

1781
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,200
You double me

1782
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,200
Can I double you?

1783
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,200
Who did you vote for?

1784
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
The murderer and X

1785
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
Is it the golden spoon?

1786
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
Or the 8-point candy got four votes?

1787
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Don't laugh

1788
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,200
I'm so scared

1789
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,200
You two are already locked, right?

1790
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,200
You should all vote for the 8-point candy

1791
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,200
The one who got four votes is

1792
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,200
The golden spoon

1793
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,200
How could it be?

1794
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,200
Who do you think voted for?

1795
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
Who voted for him?

1796
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,200
It's impossible

1797
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
The 8-point candy I voted for

1798
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,200
Why didn't you listen?

1799
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
He said he voted for him

1800
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Why did you get four votes?

1801
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
I don't know

1802
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,200
You voted for me two votes

1803
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,200
Why did you get two votes?

1804
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,200
The murderer and X voted for me

1805
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Wait

1806
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
The murderer and X voted for you

1807
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
I voted for you

1808
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
I voted for him

1809
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
The murderer and X

1810
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,200
You're still acting?

1811
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,200
You're so interesting

1812
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
Don't laugh, bro

1813
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
You're so bad

1814
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
It's very possible that

1815
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,200
He sent breakfast at 57 points

1816
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
for a long time

1817
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
It's a long-term evidence

1818
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
So I think the golden spoon is

1819
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,200
The biggest suspect

1820
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,200
I voted for him

1821
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,200
My real murderer is

1822
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,200
The golden spoon

1823
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,200
The motive to avenge the dead

1824
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,200
I used double voting rights

1825
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
The most precious vote is

1826
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,200
The golden spoon

1827
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
The murderer I'm going to choose today

1828
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,200
is He Niba

1829
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
I'm your second choice

1830
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,200
I chose you

1831
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,200
We both chose me

1832
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,200
What are you thinking?

1833
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,200
It's not that he loves me

1834
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,200
Really?

1835
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
Who voted for me?

1836
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,200
We both voted for you

1837
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,200
You two

1838
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,200
So the most stupid one is not me

1839
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
No

1840
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,200
Why did you two vote for me?

1841
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,200
From your point of view

1842
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,200
I'm right

1843
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Yes, he's right

1844
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
I tell you

1845
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
The last round is you two

1846
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
I'm not going to say

1847
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,200
Next

1848
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,200
Is it successful to announce everyone's murder?

1849
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,200
It's not successful

1850
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,200
Why do you have this expression?

1851
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,200
No

1852
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,200
It's successful

1853
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,200
This game

1854
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
I lost

1855
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
Fail

1856
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,200
I lost

1857
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Who is the murderer?

1858
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,200
He

1859
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,200
Why is it me?

1860
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,200
You

1861
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,200
Not me

1862
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,200
No one knows

1863
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,200
The murderer is

1864
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,200
He Niba

1865
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,200
Are you sure?

1866
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
The murderer is

1867
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
So nervous

1868
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,200
8 points

1869
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
Why did you vote for me?

1870
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,200
I almost got zero votes

1871
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,200
X is him

1872
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,200
Not announced yet

1873
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,200
X is him

1874
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Who is the murderer?

1875
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Go away

1876
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
You

1877
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,200
You lost my trust

1878
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,200
I tell you

1879
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,200
The key evidence of the missing is

1880
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,200
Under the 8-point sugar ring

1881
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
There's a sugar with blood

1882
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Sugar

1883
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200
Is there anything here?

1884
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,200
Sugar and ginger

1885
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
So our two minutes

1886
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Basically impossible

1887
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,200
It's me and 8

1888
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,200
It's not enough for three minutes

1889
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,200
I want to ask

1890
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
Three minutes

1891
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,200
Just deliver

1892
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,200
It takes so long

1893
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,200
Then put it on the right track

1894
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
It seems that all people's time

1895
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,200
It seems that all people's time

1896
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,200
It's not so full

1897
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
Yes

1898
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
When I came out

1899
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,200
I met him in the corridor

1900
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
No, there's another question

1901
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,200
Actually, you two have a period

1902
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,200
It's not the time to see each other

1903
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,200
That period

1904
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,200
8-point sugar

1905
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,200
Sister was on the live broadcast before

1906
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,200
So she has this logic

1907
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,200
Discovered here

1908
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,200
It's a huge live broadcast

1909
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,200
They talked

1910
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,200
They were always facing each other

1911
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,200
Why don't you pay attention?

1912
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,200
You need a green screen

1913
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,200
Or the same space

1914
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,200
You can take that video

1915
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,200
The outside of the door

1916
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,200
Isn't there a bunch of green boxes?

1917
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
What do you mean?

1918
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,200
Kill in the door

1919
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,200
I was just in the show

1920
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
I said this episode of high light

1921
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,200
It's on my brother

1922
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,200
I voted for a key vote

1923
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
You'd better not say that

1924
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
It's even worse now

1925
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,200
I didn't expect

1926
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,200
You are the one who made the decision

1927
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,200
It turns out to be you

1928
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,200
But it doesn't matter

1929
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,200
It's a natural moment between us

1930
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,200
You did a great job today

1931
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,200
Because before I voted

1932
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
I repeatedly doubted you and him

1933
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,200
Who is X

1934
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,200
But I can think of

1935
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,200
Every word you said

1936
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,200
Is it this person or that person

1937
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,200
I can't remember what I said for nothing

1938
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,200
I can't remember a word

1939
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,200
I just thought

1940
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,200
You see him

1941
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,200
You've lost your mind

1942
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,200
So you see

1943
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,200
No, no, no

1944
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,200
I have a summary for him

1945
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Because there is such a person

1946
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,200
We define him in four words

1947
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,200
Not stupid

1948
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,200
Not stupid

1949
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Not stupid

1950
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,200
He is not stupid

1951
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,200
He can only be bad

1952
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,200
Our judgment of you is

1953
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,200
You can't be bad

1954
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,200
You are stupid

1955
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,200
Don't talk about me

1956
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,200
The six of us can come here

1957
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,200
Actually, it's pretty ignorant

1958
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,200
But I've been right all the time today

1959
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,200
Don't go back to the bowl

1960
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,200
Don't be full

1961
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,200
That's enough

1962
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,200
Next, please

1963
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,200
Bafentang and Baihanzi

1964
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,200
Get your own golden key

1965
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,200
Is it double?

1966
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,200
Congratulations

1967
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,200
He didn't double

1968
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
The current golden key ranking

1969
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,200
Bafentang and Baihanzi

1970
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,200
are ranked first

1971
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
We are ranked second

1972
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
It sounds good

1973
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,200
Sounds good

1974
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,200
OK

1975
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,200
Today's rule is

1976
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,200
He hides well

1977
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,200
We suspect that

1978
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,200
He has less people

1979
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
That's right

1980
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,200
It's like this

1981
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,200
I'm scared

1982
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,200
You scared me

1983
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,200
This is the person

1984
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,200
Hello, everyone

1985
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,200
We have seen each other this morning

1986
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,200
But at that time, I was a little embarrassed

1987
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,200
I was scared by you

1988
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Now I will introduce myself to you again

1989
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,200
I am the investor of Tan Qian

1990
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,200
I invested 5 million yuan

1991
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,200
in this food factory

1992
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,200
So this live industry is yours

1993
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,200
But I didn't expect

1994
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,200
He died

1995
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,200
I'm sorry

1996
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,200
I didn't expect

1997
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,200
He could have died

1998
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,200
But I can't waste my money

1999
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,200
So from today

2000
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,200
I will take over this food factory

2001
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,200
That is to say

2002
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,200
I am your boss

2003
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,200
You can call me Mr. An

2004
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,200
Mr. An

2005
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,200
We didn't sign the contract with you

2006
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,200
We didn't work

2007
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,200
We don't work

2008
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,200
We play games

2009
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,200
We go to jail

2010
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,200
Because he is a little

2011
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,200
I'm going to resign

2012
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,200
We have a contract with this food factory

2013
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,200
I didn't start being an ignorant worker

2014
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,200
Don't worry, everyone

2015
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,200
I don't know anything about what Tan Qian did before

2016
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,200
But I will turn off the live broadcast of the factory

2017
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,200
And I will organize all the relevant information

2018
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,200
Put it in the secret room

2019
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,200
Before I investigate Tan Qian's case

2020
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,200
No one can leave here

2021
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,200
Please rest assured

2022
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,200
No one who does wrong can escape

2023
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,200
Will be punished

2024
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,200
You two go to the secret room of Tan Qian's office later

2025
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,200
I need to use it

2026
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,200
Yes

2027
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,200
As for you

2028
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,200
You can go back to the dorm and rest

2029
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,200
Let's talk tomorrow

2030
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,200
OK

2031
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,200
OK

2032
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,200
Thank you, Mr. An

2033
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,200
OK, I will do my best

2034
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,200
OK

2035
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
Let's go

2036
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,200
Go back and have a good sleep

2037
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Get a good sleep

2038
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,200
OK, it's fun

2039
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,200
Great, come on

2040
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,200
Then tonight

2041
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,200
I will watch this little fairy

2042
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,200
Come with me

2043
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,200
Come with me

2044
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,200
Because of the rapid development of the Internet

2045
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,200
Live-bought goods

2046
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,200
has become a very popular way of consumption

2047
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,200
Just like Tan Qian in the story

2048
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
She actually took a fancy to this trend

2049
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,200
So she asked my sister to do this live-bought goods

2050
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,200
But her shortcoming is that

2051
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,200
Because of the advantages she saw

2052
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,200
She made money

2053
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,200
So she wants to take some small advantages

2054
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,200
She will do something

2055
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,200
Maybe it will hurt some of the consumers' behavior

2056
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,200
For example, selling fake mooncakes

2057
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,200
Or selling fake candy

2058
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,200
I saw the live broadcast room

2059
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,200
The feeling is very shocking

2060
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,200
I think it's like

2061
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,200
The virtual scene in our show

2062
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,200
But it's also like

2063
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,200
The real life situation

2064
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,200
Welcome to the small pink factory live broadcast room

2065
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,200
Welcome to the very small room live broadcast room

2066
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,200
Welcome to the business live broadcast room

2067
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,200
Because these years

2068
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,200
Because these years

2069
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,200
Everyone will think that live broadcast is a peak

2070
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,200
Many people have entered this peak

2071
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,200
Right

2072
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
It's Reba's costume

2073
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,200
Today is the dance special of the ancient style

2074
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,200
Let's show the kids today's cards

2075
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,200
Our game rules today are

2076
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,200
Right or wrong

2077
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,200
This handsome guy

2078
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,200
I want to pull it for you too

2079
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,200
See one by one

2080
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,200
Everyone is live broadcast

2081
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,200
As if you see

2082
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,200
Not a living person

2083
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,200
But a puppet controlled by traffic

2084
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
So in fact, I have a deep feeling

2085
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Which star do you want to listen to live broadcast?

2086
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,200
Which star's live broadcast is not very familiar today

2087
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,200
Do you want to hear the nine stars?

2088
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,200
I'll just put that one

2089
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,200
Nine stars

2090
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,200
The latest flight number is for you

2091
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,200
Really illegal

2092
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,200
Really illegal

2093
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,200
I really serve

2094
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,200
What are they doing?

2095
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,200
They are in the live broadcast room

2096
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,200
Take some people's privacy

2097
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,200
Some people's shape

2098
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,200
Some people's private life

2099
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,200
The code is marked

2100
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,200
Then chop them up and feed them to the audience

2101
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,200
There is another benefit

2102
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,200
Is color-coded second-person language

2103
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,200
I'll give you his parents' phone numbers

2104
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
All illegal

2105
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,200
Sometimes I will also be killed in this kind of live broadcast

2106
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
And I can see myself in it

2107
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,200
At this time

2108
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,200
I want to say that I am so ridiculous

2109
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,200
As a result, many people below are believing

2110
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,200
In fact, I have a little melon here

2111
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,200
Can share with you

2112
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,200
Shut up

2113
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
I have also encountered some

2114
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,200
Some crazy private behavior

2115
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,200
Someone knocks on your door

2116
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,200
Then someone at your door

2117
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,200
To talk to you

2118
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,200
Shout

2119
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,200
Something like that

2120
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,200
Just try to get some ways

2121
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Closer to your private life

2122
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,200
In fact, there will still be some difficulties

2123
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,200
I think

2124
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,200
Live broadcast is now developing very fast

2125
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,200
And there are a lot of people to pay attention to

2126
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,200
Want to participate in it

2127
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,200
What I want to say is to remind everyone

2128
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,200
Improve your self-prevention awareness

2129
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,200
Don't be limited

2130
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,200
Don't be limited

2131
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,200
Any very popular one

2132
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,200
Something easily deceived

2133
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,200
Live broadcast can be seen

2134
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,200
But I think there must be a degree

2135
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,200
Because my own feeling is

2136
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,200
I think we should spend more time

2137
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,200
On our own

2138
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,200
Improving yourself is the most important

2139
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,200
If you buy some illegal products

2140
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,200
Learn to use the law to defend yourself

2141
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,200
Understand the rules of the platform and the relevant laws

2142
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,200
Only in this way can we be in live shopping

2143
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,200
Enjoy convenience better

2144
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,200
And then better ensure your rights

2145
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,200
I hope I can see all the adults in this program

2146
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,200
I hope in these things

2147
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,200
Have your ability to distinguish right from wrong

2148
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,200
Of course, I also hope that this live broadcast industry

2149
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,200
Can be more and more regular

2150
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,200
This question still needs specific questions

2151
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,200
Specific analysis

2152
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,200
Mainly we still have to see

2153
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,200
What kind of role does the anchor play in this

2154
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,200
There are mainly three situations

2155
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,200
The first one is that the anchor is the seller

2156
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,200
In this case

2157
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,200
If he does not fulfill the obligation as a seller

2158
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,200
For example, before the purchase

2159
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,200
You have to check if the product is qualified

2160
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,200
In this case

2161
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,200
According to the consumer rights protection law

2162
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,200
Product quality law

2163
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,200
Including e-commerce law and so on

2164
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,200
A series of legal regulations

2165
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,200
If the consumer finds that the product has a problem

2166
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,200
You can ask the anchor first

2167
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,200
That is, the seller is the first to take the responsibility for compensation

2168
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,200
Of course, after the anchor has paid the compensation

2169
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:24,200
After that, I found that the product was actually the producer's problem

2170
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,200
At this time, I can also go to the manufacturer to pursue the factory

2171
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
So the second situation is

2172
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,200
The anchor is actually an advertising spokesperson

2173
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,200
For example, we often invite some famous people

2174
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,200
To endorse a certain product

2175
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,200
So at this time

2176
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,200
Advertisers are actually responsible

2177
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,200
So the third situation is

2178
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,200
The anchor is recommending this product

2179
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,200
He is not responsible for selling

2180
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,200
Then he also entered his reasonable review obligation

2181
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,200
There is no mistake

2182
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,200
In this case

2183
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,200
The main responsibility is still to be borne by the seller of the product

2184
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,200
The third situation is

2185
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,200
The third situation is

2186
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,200
The third situation is

2187
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,200
The third situation is

2188
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,200
The third situation is

2189
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,200
The third situation is

2190
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,200
The third situation is

2191
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,200
The third situation is

2192
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,200
The third situation is

2193
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
The third situation is

2194
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,200
The third situation is

2195
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,200
The third situation is

2196
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,200
The third situation is

2197
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,200
The third situation is

2198
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,200
The third situation is

2199
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,200
The third situation is

2200
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
The third situation is

2201
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,200
The third situation is

2202
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,200
The third situation is

2203
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,200
The third situation is

2204
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,200
The third situation is

2205
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,200
The third situation is

2206
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,200
The third situation is

2207
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,200
The third situation is

2208
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,200
The third situation is

2209
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,200
The third situation is

2210
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,200
The third situation is

2211
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,200
The third situation is

2212
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,200
The third situation is

2213
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,200
The third situation is

2214
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,200
The third situation is

2215
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,200
The third situation is

2216
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,200
The third situation is

2217
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,200
The third situation is

2218
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,200
The third situation is

2219
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,200
The third situation is

2220
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,200
The third situation is

2221
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,200
The third production of the product

2222
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,200
You can?

2223
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,200
Can you please make some April Fools' Problems?

2224
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,200
That scene was helpful

2225
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,200
Such a practice

2226
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,200
I kill, I want to kill

2227
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,200
I accept

2228
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,200
What you want to do

2229
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,200
is to guide me

2230
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,120
Go to the live room

2231
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,320
The audience closed the door

2232
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,160
Zhou Keyu

2233
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,480
Who do you think this is?

2234
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,520
I can't see it at all

2235
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,840
Mr. Four

2236
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,240
Look at your old-fashioned childhood photos

2237
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,480
What did Jin Sixue say at this time?

2238
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,120
I am the murderer of this case, Ba Fen Tang

2239
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,480
I realized that the green wall of the factory

2240
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,880
In fact, it is for the convenience of re-editing and changing the background

2241
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:48,200
Everyone is being filmed by hidden cameras

2242
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,600
Becoming the unknown protagonist

2243
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:50,720
He said

2244
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,000
Can you do a full-body study with a shrimp?

2245
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,080
Why are you a chef?

2246
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:55,640
Okay

2247
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:56,960
Like me

2248
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,720
I'm not hungry at all

2249
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,360
So beautiful

2250
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,320
You don't have to worry about your husband's materials

2251
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,160
You two are like my father

2252
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:07,800
Take pictures

2253
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,000

2254
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,160

Brother Liu brushed

2259
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:16,440
Three

2260
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,440
This picture is really the old-fashioned

2261
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,800
One, two, three

2262
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,320
Hands

2263
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,320

2265
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,120
