1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
The

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,720
The

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,240
The

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,400
This is your lunch.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,440
I made you

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,000
Manhan Quanxi.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,440
The noodles are not tasty at all.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,160
Water noodles.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,520
Yes.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,200
We are a pre-made canteen.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,960
Shrimp and tofu soup.

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
Only lucky children can eat shrimp.

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,880
Shrimp and tofu soup.

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,760
Shrimp and tofu soup.

15
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,320
He said

16
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,960
using one shrimp

17
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,600
can make Manhan Quanxi.

18
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,520
Why did you

19
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,920
cut the ingredients secretly?

20
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,280
You are the only one who works hard.

21
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,040
You are the only one who works hard.

22
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,400
It may be my food

23
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,960
that has made you hungry.

24
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,280
I want to relax a little.

25
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,760
Eat more.

26
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,200
Are you happy now?

27
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,800
Beef oil.

28
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,920
It's spicy.

29
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,080
Like me.

30
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,320
The color of the actor

31
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,720
looks like a young man.

32
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,080
Am I not a young man?

33
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,880
Yes, I am a old man.

34
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not hungry at all.

35
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,120
So beautiful.

36
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,920
Awesome.

37
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm so hungry.

38
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,880
Leave the food to me.

39
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,680
I don't need to worry.

40
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,120
Let's sit here.

41
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,600
Put everything on this table.

42
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,160
I'll bring you the food.

43
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,760
OK.

44
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,520
You go to analyze.

45
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,640
I'll bring you the food.

46
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,240
This is your lunch.

47
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,000
I made Manhan Quanxi for you.

48
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,720
You have been with us just now.

49
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,240
When did you make it?

50
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,320
I made it in the morning.

51
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,880
You made lunch in the morning?

52
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,760
Yes.

53
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,480
We are a pre-made canteen.

54
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
OK.

55
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,000
What is this?

56
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,600
Eggs.

57
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,680
Shrimp Steamed Eggs.

58
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,200
And seafood noodles.

59
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Seafood noodles.

60
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,680
OK, thank you.

61
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,840
I have a whole shrimp.

62
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you.

63
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
Thank you.

64
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Great.

65
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,640
Thank you.

66
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
Is it so light?

67
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:51,960
No.

68
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,640
It's seafood.

69
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,320
There are a lot of chicken tail shrimp.

70
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,520
And shrimp tofu soup.

71
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,760
Thank you.

72
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,400
Shrimp tofu soup and seafood noodles.

73
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Thank you.

74
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,360
Seafood noodles should be good.

75
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,600
Shrimp tofu soup is like this.

76
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,480
Only lucky children can know shrimp.

77
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
Shrimp tofu soup.

78
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,640
Shrimp.

79
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,280
He said that

80
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,840
using one shrimp can make Manhan Quanxi, right?

81
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,960
That is, all our meals

82
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
are just a shrimp.

83
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,880
We made a meal.

84
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,600
Your chef is so simple.

85
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,080
It's just a shrimp.

86
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,960
There are so many shrimps.

87
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,280
Why do you keep putting shrimp?

88
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,960
There is no flavor at all.

89
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,200
Water noodles.

90
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,080
OK.

91
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,480
I'll get some of my own food

92
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
for you.

93
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,000
What is it?

94
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120
What is it?

95
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
Some of my own food.

96
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
Food for self-hiding.

97
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,600
Is it Tangxing moon cake?

98
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,000
You eat so much.

99
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,160
Help him.

100
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh, really?

101
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,520
It's really a work meal.

102
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,240
Let me do it.

103
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,640
I really have it.

104
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,280
Give it to me.

105
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,200
Give it to me.

106
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,000
Happy.

107
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,680
Because today

108
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,520
we are eating here, right?

109
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,800
OK.

110
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,840
Let's clean up the table.

111
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,240
This is the result of the audience's request.

112
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,440
We are going to reduce the score for the meal.

113
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,840
Will the meal be reduced?

114
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,560
The meal is reduced

115
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,160
because we are happy.

116
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,240
Everyone found out my private food.

117
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,920
I should add points.

118
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,080
You gave this factory staff

119
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,120
a whole shrimp and ten bowls of noodles.

120
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,520
And you ate such a good thing.

121
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Yes, and I ate six servings.

122
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,080
No wonder.

123
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,560
It's a little spicy.

124
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Who is spicy?

125
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,240
This.

126
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,120
Beef.

127
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,840
Let's talk about the case.

128
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Let's talk.

129
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
We can talk.

130
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,760
That is...

131
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,920
I just said this is a single door, right?

132
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,440
Are you sure it's a single door?

133
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,840
I don't know.

134
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,120
I forgot that they had a time to kill each other.

135
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,560
8.06 and 8.09.

136
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,160
That's the time to break in.

137
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,800
Wait a minute.

138
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
I have to get that thing.

139
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
Or my brain is always doing this.

140
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,920
I think he is trying to find out

141
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,880
if he is suspected of being X.

142
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,760
Who?

143
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,160
Him.

144
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,800
He is very hardworking.

145
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,360
No.

146
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,680
Don't say that.

147
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,320
I tell you.

148
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,360
I don't believe you anymore.

149
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,280
So you have to prove yourself.

150
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,960
I don't need to prove.

151
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,000
What's there to prove?

152
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,840
Are you X?

153
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,680
It's none of your business.

154
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,440
Of course I don't care.

155
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,880
Because I have the right to vote.

156
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,520
Just vote.

157
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,080
Just look at the vote.

158
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
As a detective,

159
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,760
you should lead the good people to victory.

160
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,240
Instead of here.

161
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,760
I don't want to say anything behind his back.

162
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,800
You don't want to?

163
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
Then don't do that later.

164
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,640
Okay.

165
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,480
Here's the thing.

166
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,600
Is it the earliest time for Bai Han to be in the living area?

167
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:50,920
Yes.

168
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
There are 8-point sugar,

169
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
Kankan,

170
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,920
and Heni.

171
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,960
But none of yours.

172
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,760
Yes, I'm not going in there.

173
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,960
You're not going in there.

174
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,800
You're not going in there,

175
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,920
but there's a passage here.

176
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,280
Yes, so...

177
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,040
Can you all go there?

178
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,360
But everyone knows

179
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
when I deliver food.

180
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,440
Yes.

181
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,320
I'll deliver food at 6.57.

182
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,360
Everyone knows this time.

183
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,160
So I'm at 6.57.

184
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm not in this space.

185
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,560
Everyone knows.

186
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
You went back to the dormitory after you delivered the food?

187
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,760
Yes.

188
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,680
I believe you went through this passage.

189
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,040
Yes.

190
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,680
This is the first one.

191
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,760
But you must know

192
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,880
there's a passage here.

193
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,520
We know it 100%.

194
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,880
You must know when you deliver food every day.

195
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
Everyone comes to this canteen every day.

196
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,720
The entrance is here.

197
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,240
Everyone knows there's a passage here.

198
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,120
But only the killer knows

199
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,160
how to open it.

200
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,040
How to open it?

201
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,880
Yes, how to open the door.

202
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,080
I'm telling you,

203
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,560
Keke,

204
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,720
we both have proof that we're not in the room.

205
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,320
Did you go out of the dormitory

206
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,440
after 7 o'clock?

207
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,680
Except for going to work.

208
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,480
No.

209
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,120
Yes, I came back at 7 o'clock.

210
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,360
I had breakfast in the dormitory.

211
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,720
The time of death is 7 o'clock.

212
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
No one saw anyone at 7 o'clock.

213
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,360
That's me.

214
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,600
So the condition of the crime today

215
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,880
is that the killer must

216
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,120
go through this door between 6.58 and 7 o'clock.

217
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,600
Yes.

218
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,760
He wasn't here at that time.

219
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,840
Can he be eliminated?

220
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,240
Why can he be eliminated?

221
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,400
Isn't he delivering food?

222
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,160
He finished it.

223
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,840
Didn't you deliver it until 8 o'clock?

224
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,400
I didn't say that.

225
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,720
What factory?

226
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
Delivered until 8 o'clock.

227
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,360
Delivered for more than an hour.

228
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,120
Delivered until 7 o'clock.

229
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
You tell me.

230
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,360
Wait a minute.

231
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,280
It shows here that

232
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,120
you didn't go to the industrial area

233
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,200
at 7 o'clock.

234
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,440
We just got to work at 7.50.

235
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,600
That means

236
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,160
if you want to go in, you must brush your face.

237
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,800
So you still go from here.

238
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
Yes, it must be here.

239
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,360
Yes.

240
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,360
Let me tell you.

241
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,640
I don't even know where this delivery is going.

242
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,200
You don't know, right?

243
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,960
I don't know.

244
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,360
I haven't touched this.

245
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,280
I know.

246
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
But you don't know.

247
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
We don't know.

248
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,760
Who knows?

249
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,800
Only he knows.

250
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,200
Yes, he just said that he went to the military.

251
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,520
So he will deliver food here.

252
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,240
But we are not military.

253
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm afraid that everyone will deliver breakfast to us.

254
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
The funeral outside before us,

255
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,880
whose score is the highest?

256
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
You.

257
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,640
Am I the highest?

258
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
You are the highest.

259
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,440
No, I'm the cheapest.

260
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,080
I'm the first.

261
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,280
How did you do this?

262
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,160
I forgot.

263
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
I think I got a higher score in the exercise.

264
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,960
Others like to see my muscles.

265
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,120
Do you like to see my muscles?

266
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,240
It's the thing that we all

267
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,760
get scores.

268
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,880
It's different.

269
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,480
He is in the work position.

270
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,680
He is in the work position.

271
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
The three of us are in the bedroom.

272
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Yes.

273
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,000
Do you usually have any

274
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
places to be tidied up?

275
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,920
No.

276
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,280
You are a staff.

277
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,840
You are a cow.

278
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,200
Maybe it's my food that

279
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
tidied up everyone's house.

280
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,160
I will get a higher score.

281
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,880
Because my food is made by

282
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,640
a shrimp.

283
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,960
Yes, it's divided into several parts.

284
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,840
People like to see

285
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,120
a cook cook.

286
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,640
Yes.

287
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,360
OK.

288
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm hungry.

289
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,240
Get a shrimp head.

290
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,320
It's a good dish.

291
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,920
One shrimp is a seafood meal.

292
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,000
Two eggs are a side dish.

293
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,880
Six yuan is a side dish.

294
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,440
There are a hundred ways to eat steamed buns.

295
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,280
So you cook for children

296
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,000
in the welfare home.

297
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,520
Yes.

298
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,720
Maybe they are not

299
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,760
killed by moon cakes.

300
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,160
You should feel guilty.

301
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I think so.

302
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,560
Our funds are limited.

303
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,520
So children can eat like this.

304
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,280
It's very happy.

305
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,440
I understand.

306
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Now, who of you

307
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,280
doesn't know the boss's password?

308
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,840
I do.

309
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,200
I do.

310
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,600
You know the boss's password.

311
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,120
I know.

312
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,840
How do you know?

313
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,640
I peeked.

314
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,040
How can you peek?

315
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,280
I can peek.

316
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
I can peek.

317
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,880
Your work ID is here.

318
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,720
I will send her food or something.

319
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,520
I always have a chance to observe her.

320
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,320
I and Ba

321
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,600
saw it when we were working.

322
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,160
Because I can see her password later.

323
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,680
But if you know the password,

324
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,760
you can peek.

325
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,560
Yes.

326
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,520
She can peek.

327
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,880
Why can't she peek?

328
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,960
I said she was motivated.

329
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,160
Because her goal is to avenge.

330
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,080
I'm reasonable in everything I do.

331
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
So I went to the boss's office.

332
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
I can know

333
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,560
what she has.

334
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,040
There must be something

335
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,640
that is of a certain direction.

336
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,360
To be honest,

337
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,640
I'm not that scared this year.

338
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,040
Really?

339
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm telling you.

340
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
I was thinking about it.

341
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,200
Why don't we think it's not that scary?

342
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,920
Stop talking.

343
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,040
Tomorrow will be more difficult.

344
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,680
It's okay.

345
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,280
Because I have been playing

346
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,440
VR for half a year.

347
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,920
What?

348
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
I played the VR zombie game.

349
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,080
VR?

350
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,600
No.

351
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,280
Really?

352
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,880
I thought you were playing VR at home.

353
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
I wanted to say your house is so big.

354
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,520
You even put on VR at home.

355
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,040
VR.

356
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,280
R.

357
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,160
You are in the Northeast.

358
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,040
VR.

359
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
I play VR.

360
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,560
VR?

361
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,560
We still need to have

362
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,320
five-man brothers to help you.

363
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,960
We just don't be afraid, right?

364
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
Just don't be afraid.

365
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, don't hide.

366
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,440
Teach me.

367
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,880
How can you be not afraid?

368
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,560
As an actor...

369
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,080
I'm not afraid.

370
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,320
I'm really afraid.

371
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
Then how can you...

372
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,400
There is no way to be afraid.

373
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,280
I can't do it.

374
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
I can't express my fear.

375
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,920
No, you mean it.

376
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
You are really afraid.

377
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,520
I'm really afraid.

378
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,160
Impossible.

379
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,080
I think you are an empty-hearted person.

380
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,440
You are not afraid at all.

381
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,720
Yes, I have no heart.

382
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,080
And I don't have to do anything.

383
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,120
You are really afraid.

384
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,800
Let's not be afraid this time, okay?

385
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,440
Okay.

386
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,800
So formal.

387
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,000
This is hot pot.

388
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Isn't this lunch?

389
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,280
Gege Wei, do you want to sit down?

390
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,840
Please sit down.

391
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,320
Sit down.

392
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,720
Please sit down.

393
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,640
I'll stand up and eat.

394
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,480
We have prepared the beef frog that brother wants to eat.

395
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,240
Tofu that Miss Reba wants to eat.

396
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
And the rice noodles that everyone wants to eat.

397
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,400
We have prepared them all.

398
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,200
We have brought the pot of fried stinky tofu.

399
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,680
The stinky tofu fried on the line.

400
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,520
What is this?

401
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,600
Stinky tofu.

402
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,920
Is this freshly fried?

403
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,200
Yes, it is.

404
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
Changsha stinky tofu.

405
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,000
You want to take a photo with Qian?

406
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
I want to take a photo with you.

407
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,200
Qian Qian, stinky tofu.

408
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,120
Is this freshly fried?

409
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,640
Yes.

410
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm so cute.

411
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,880
Why am I getting prettier?

412
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,680
This is our camera, right?

413
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,880
It's really beautiful.

414
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,320
I'll take a photo.

415
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,160
You take a photo.

416
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,080
But you have to take a photo from a angle.

417
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,600
Do you understand?

418
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
Yes, you touch your hand.

419
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,920
Yes.

420
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,840
Three, two.

421
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,440
It's beautiful.

422
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,600
It's beautiful.

423
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,720
Okay.

424
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Let me take a photo for you.

425
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
You haven't taken a photo for me for such a long time.

426
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,480
I just pretended to be the natural person.

427
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,280
You didn't take a photo for me.

428
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh.

429
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,360
The color of the actor looks like a young man.

430
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,560
What do you mean?

431
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,880
Am I not a young man?

432
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,360
Yes, I'm an old man.

433
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,720
So beautiful.

434
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,400
So beautiful.

435
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,800
This must be lit.

436
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,200
Awesome.

437
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,880
No.

438
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,080
You sit there.

439
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,680
You stand on the corner of the wall.

440
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,520
I'll take a super big photo for you.

441
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,880
Yes.

442
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,720
You're in our material.

443
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,480
No need to worry.

444
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,200
Today, the dishes on the table

445
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,120
are the most famous specialties of Changsha.

446
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,360
Including barbecue.

447
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,680
It's a special dish of Changsha.

448
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,720
Oh, I see.

449
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,040
You're starting to relax.

450
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,560
Special food.

451
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,040
Are you happy?

452
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
Oh, butter.

453
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,440
This chest oil is really delicious.

454
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,280
Very delicious.

455
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,160
What's that?

456
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,680
This.

457
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,400
I'll eat it.

458
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,680
I just ate the small one.

459
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,200
This chest oil is so delicious.

460
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,760
Right?

461
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,120
So spicy.

462
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,840
Like me.

463
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,720
What do you eat?

464
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
This.

465
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,280
Not bad.

466
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,400
So spicy.

467
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,480
Can you eat spicy food?

468
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,080
I can.

469
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
Why do I feel like you can eat spicy food?

470
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,320
I can.

471
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,360
Today, you know,

472
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,880
the one we fried for lunch.

473
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,360
The green pepper in the middle.

474
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,720
I think that's very spicy.

475
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,960
Not bad.

476
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,400
I'm good at eating in the South.

477
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,360
I have...

478
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,200
When I recorded the first season of this show,

479
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,240
I ate spicy food in Changsha.

480
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
I've been eating it since then.

481
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,120
But I feel like you can eat it better than me.

482
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,880
I can't eat it.

483
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,160
No.

484
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,920
Look at the hot pot.

485
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,400
It's really funny.

486
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,040
Don't you think?

487
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,200
It's really funny.

488
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,480
Hot pot stewing yourself.

489
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,280
So the middle passage

490
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,320
is our passage, right?

491
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,920
Yes.

492
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,200
I didn't notice that.

493
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,680
I think so.

494
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,320
I didn't notice.

495
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,280
No wonder

496
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,960
why so many green peppers are used in the factory.

497
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,640
This special effect is made by green peppers.

498
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,160
It's easy to pick.

499
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,680
It's easy to pick.

500
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,480
Today is the first day of the filming of the first episode.

501
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,560
How do you feel?

502
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,280
Not scary enough.

503
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,720
OK.

504
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,400
You guys are getting bolder.

505
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,120
Do you want to be more scary?

506
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,600
OK.

507
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,120
OK.

508
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,560
Add spicy and spicy.

509
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,440
No.

510
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,480
It's not necessary.

511
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,440
Who said that?

512
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,360
Who do you want to add spicy and spicy?

513
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,480
Right?

514
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,400
I said it's the green pepper.

515
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,320
OK.

516
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,240
Brother Lin said today

517
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
that he's getting bolder this year.

518
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,640
Yes.

519
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,840
Didn't you say that?

520
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,400
Yes.

521
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
I'm not satisfied with you.

522
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,240
I'm not that scared.

523
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
You look calm.

524
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,560
But sometimes I pretend to be calm.

525
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
But I can hold on a little bit more than last year.

526
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,840
Last year, I couldn't hold on.

527
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,480
I couldn't hold on.

528
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,840
Now I can hold on.

529
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,320
You can hold on.

530
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,480
I'll take this opportunity to train myself.

531
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,880
What do you think?

532
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,280
I used to play VR.

533
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,840
I wore glasses.

534
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,040
I played it every day in the world.

535
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
I played VR at home.

536
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,520
Didn't we search everywhere this time?

537
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,840
Yes.

538
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
Let's find evidence together.

539
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,560
Let's discuss it at any time.

540
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:14,840
Yes.

541
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,800
The mechanism has changed.

542
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Do you like it?

543
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
It's good.

544
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,760
I think it's good.

545
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,160
It's better than the last season.

546
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,640
Right?

547
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,040
The second season is to sit there and talk.

548
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,720
Everyone is moving.

549
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,760
Everyone is moving.

550
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
Everyone is involved.

551
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,120
Yes.

552
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,400
And it's because

553
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,280
we can't let Bai Yu sit in a place for too long.

554
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,120
He will fall asleep.

555
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,640
OK.

556
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,040
Now there are two teachers' photos.

557
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,640
We are still in the light.

558
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,400
I'll call you when it's over.

559
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,880
The two teachers stay here.

560
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
The others...

561
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
Why are you in a group?

562
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,160
Tell me who they are.

563
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,840
I decide whether to accompany them.

564
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,920
One of them is me.

565
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,520
You two.

566
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,960
We are both involved.

567
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,840
I will definitely leave.

568
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,400
OK.

569
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,120
We just changed the name of the group for you.

570
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,840
Don't forget.

571
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,400
You should be the one who is most in the group.

572
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,480
Will there be a flight for the six of us in this season?

573
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,240
There will be.

574
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,040
No.

575
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,760
Will there be?

576
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,200
Actually, I'm a pilot.

577
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
I understand.

578
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,160
I won't come tomorrow.

579
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,520
You're not an intern, right?

580
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,920
I won't come tomorrow.

581
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm not hungry at all.

582
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,480
You've been eating for a long time.

583
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
But you still say that you're not hungry.

584
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
You eat a lot.

585
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm really not hungry.

586
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,720
Otherwise, I can eat for a while.

587
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,600
You think so?

588
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360
I have to go back to exercise today.

589
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,920
Eat.

590
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,040
Exercise.

591
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,080
I gained 6 to 7 kilograms in three months.

592
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,720
You are a real chicken.

593
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:54,920
Yes.

594
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,000
But I will gain some fat.

595
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,440
I gained some skin from Sha Xing.

596
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
You can't tell.

597
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
I can't tell.

598
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,080
Wait a minute. How heavy are you now?

599
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,560
I'm 150 now.

600
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,960
You're 150?

601
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,040
You're not as heavy as me.

602
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,680
How heavy are you?

603
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,880
I'm 76.

604
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm 75.

605
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,400
But I was 68 when I was the thinnest.

606
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
Yes, I was 69 when I was the thinnest.

607
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,720
Yes, almost.

608
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,680
Our height.

609
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,640
You two are a little thin when you're tall.

610
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,920
So 6'8, 6'9 is just right.

611
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,880
6'8, 6'9 is the rib chest.

612
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,080
Okay.

613
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,400
Then we will continue tomorrow.

614
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,480
Thank you.

615
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,720
Bye.

616
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,680
Bye.

617
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,200
Come and eat.

618
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,680
Come on.

619
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,320
Let's eat.

620
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,920
Come on.

621
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,640
I really remember that he went to his home

622
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,720
to perform last time.

623
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,600
Really?

624
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,520
You started a performance class.

625
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,920
I want to learn it too.

626
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,000
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

627
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,960
Is it because of you?

628
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Yes.

629
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,760
I thought my character was Gu Xiaolian.

630
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
I thought he was the most rich.

631
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,320
You are rich.

632
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,960
I didn't expect that I was the man.

633
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,840
Who will you choose to be the S?

634
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,160
To be honest, I will choose the 8.

635
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,320
If you are the S,

636
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,200
who will you choose to be the S?

637
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,120
I will choose the 8.

638
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,920
I will choose the 4.

639
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,960
Who will you choose to be the S?

640
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,640
I will choose you.

641
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,240
Who will you choose to be the S?

642
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,120
I don't know.

643
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,800
If I am the X, I will never be the S.

644
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,560
That's all.

645
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,160
Who do you think is in a very good state?

646
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,000
I think it's Bo An.

647
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,400
He is very quiet today.

648
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,760
Why don't you talk?

649
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,720
Do you know how to do it?

650
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,800
I'm hungry.

651
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,920
Give me two bites.

652
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,560
Okay.

653
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
Why are you laughing?

654
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm laughing because I'm laughing.

655
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,520
You are either guilty

656
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,600
or you have fallen in love with him.

657
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,720
I have fallen in love.

658
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,680
Oh my god.

659
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,520

There will be a game of push-pull.

667
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,640
It's not just an update, but also a game.

668

The game is like a game of push-pull.

674
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
The game is like a game of push-pull.

675
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Let's start the push-pull.

676
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Let's start the push-pull.

677
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,920
Let's start the push-pull.

678
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920

Use your courage to start the push-pull.

Let's start the push-pull.

688
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Find the password.

689
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Talk to the evidence.
