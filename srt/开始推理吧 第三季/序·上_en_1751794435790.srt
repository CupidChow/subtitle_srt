1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
The third season of The

2
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,520
Group is about to begin.

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,920
The third season is waiting for you.

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,760
We are new tenants

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,720
who just moved in.

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,000
In the 11th apartment,

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,120
the 1st is the neighbor.

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,160
Let me take care of you.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,240
Bai Song, Yi Guo Zhou,

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,360
Liu Yitong, Wang Jingyu.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,160
Because we are family.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
What is this?

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,760
We are family.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
What is this?

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,760
We are now running into

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,680
the house.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,520
Liu Yitong and Wang Jingyu

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,360
are going to kill each other.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,800
This is the latest report

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
from the city radio FM0424.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,840
This week will welcome

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,680
unprecedented cold weather.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,480
Please be prepared for the cold.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Entertainment news.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,280
Let's start the ceremony.

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,840
The third season is about to begin.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,000
He Li Mo and Jin Yu will gather together

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,320
to have a special team building day and night.

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,400
Let's look forward to He Li Mo and Jin Yu.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
Hello, everyone.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,560
I am Jin Jin, the sister of everyone.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,920
The big stage of the village.

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,920
The big stage of the village.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,840
The big stage of the village.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,760
You have to wait for me.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,040
Before we start the ceremony,

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,200
let's have a happy team building day

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,600
with He Li Mo and Jin Yu.

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,200
The first one to come to us.

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
The god of wisdom is soft to him.

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,760
The beautiful god is kind to him.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,280
He can always find the clues from his memory.

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,160
He can solve the mystery at the critical moment.

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,120
Why is there no KEMU3?

45
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
You are KEMU3.

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
You are talking to us

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,480
on behalf of the people of this era.

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,200
The person you suspect is me.

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,440
I am the killer.

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
The killer of Thomas.

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,520
The handsome man's generation won three grand prizes.

52
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,800
He said it himself.

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
I signed the contract with Zitao Le.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
We are artists who signed the contract with TYP.

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
It's still in the list.

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,880
Ketao Le, Zitao Le.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,320
You have nothing to do with Zitao Le.

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,560
You are his ex-boyfriend.

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,800
I don't.

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,480
You have nothing to do with my girlfriend.

61
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,120
No.

62
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,520
Pull it up.

63
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,080
Mr. Wang asked me to warm up his back at night.

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
Warm up his back.

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,000
The whole stage is moving.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,080
Let's welcome

67
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,960
Dilili Li Reba.

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,120
The next one

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,800
is the main character of our team.

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,120
When it's too dark,

71
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,520
grab the time to spare

72
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
and lie down on the floor.

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,360
Why don't we sit down and calculate?

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
But I have to admit that

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,240
the place where he is is full of security.

76
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,280
Is it that hard?

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,240
Is the door open?

78
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,480
Is the door open?

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,880
Come on, follow me.

80
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,480
It's okay.

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,440
Follow me.

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,120
Follow me.

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,120
He is the hero of our last season.

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
Bai Yu.

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
He has a long leg.

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,040
He is the king of the weak and strong.

87
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
On the track,

88
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,200
he is taking us to the end of the world.

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
He must have been locked

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
at the moment of the end of the world.

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,640
But he must have been a law-abiding person in 1988.

92
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
And they are from Wu Ke Nai.

93
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,040
Do you understand?

94
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,200
If you are not from X-Men,

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
how can you play 2V3?

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,880
Tell me.

97
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,960
After turning off the light,

98
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
listen to his singing to save you.

99
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,040
Don't touch my sister.

100
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,640
Don't scare me.

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,720
Don't touch me.

102
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,600
Don't scare me.

103
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
Don't touch me.

104
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,840
Stop.

105
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,240
He is the best gay

106
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,400
in our team.

107
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,600
Liu Yu.

108
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,400
The next one.

109
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,160
In his heart,

110
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,520
my heart will jump around.

111
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,440
In his hand,

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
I will pulse around.

113
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
He is my true and true doctor.

114
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
Born famous.

115
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,320
Dangerous and charming.

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,280
You have a new life.

117
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,640
The final stage.

118
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Play these elements

119
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,600
to the end.

120
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
I am a love-sick.

121
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,280
Master.

122
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,600
You can go to eat.

123
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Go.

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,640
The character that accurately takes the beauty of the year

125
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,800
is the fan of the fans.

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,680
The time of X-Men

127
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,720
is equal to

128
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,960
Y divided by 1.4.

129
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,840
X equals 2.

130
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,760
In 2000.

131
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,680
550 wills.

132
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,440
It means there are 50 wills.

133
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,040
The whole number of minus one

134
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,360
equals 130.

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
Open 130.

136
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,320
I am the one.

137
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,880
The difference in the feeling of making a machine

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
is determined by the

139
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,640
master.

140
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,600
It makes me jump with all my heart.

141
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,040
Zhang Yifan.

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,440
You are really different from him.

143
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,680
Your tone is so high.

144
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,960
The last one to go to the stage

145
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,320
is the snake-slayer of the beginning of the week.

146
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
He has the art of speaking accurately.

147
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
You are dead at most.

148
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
Why didn't you die?

149
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,120
How did you survive?

150
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,920
Why didn't you die today?

151
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,880
You should have died yesterday.

152
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,720
When can you die?

153
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,320
The key moment is never to drop the chain.

154
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,000
I know.

155
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,320
The business opened in 2010.

156
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,280
It was lost for a year.

157
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
Then in 2011,

158
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,840
after meeting the customer,

159
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,520
the profit began to increase.

160
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,280
That is in 1911.

161
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,680
I remember it.

162
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,760
When he was reading the book here,

163
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,520
he kept doing this.

164
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,240
He was already doing it at that time.

165
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,640
It's a great deal.

166
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,480
A hundred books.

167
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
The speed of hand and brain are all super fast.

168
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,440
Please accept the love of Zize.

169
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,680
After so long,

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,240
the fish in the river is back.

171
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,040
Yes.

172
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,240
When he came,

173
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,520
should we...

174
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Yes.

175
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
It's changed.

176
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,120
It's changed.

177
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,520
The goldfish in the river.

178
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
The goldfish in the river.

179
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,040
Yes.

180
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,960
The goldfish in the river.

181
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,840
The goldfish in the river.

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,800
The goldfish in the river.

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,640
The goldfish in the river.

184
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
OK.

185
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,120
You changed it for me.

186
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,360
You are so nice to me.

187
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,640
Otherwise, I'm your brother.

188
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,880
I'm a chicken monkey.

189
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
A chicken.

190
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,000
OK.

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560
Then we'll leave our autographs

192
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,400
on the autograph board.

193
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Then we'll enter the stage.

194
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,480
Let's touch the goldfish together.

195
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Touch the goldfish in the river.

196
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,520
Touch the goldfish in the river.

197
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,560
Happy Three.

198
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,280
We are here.

199
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,800
The door is open.

200
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
It's...

201
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,200
Go inside.

202
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,720
The environment is better here.

203
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
Hello.

204
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,320
You are the one who came to the team

205
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,240
for the return match, right?

206
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
Yes.

207
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,840
Yes, sir.

208
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,320
Wait a minute.

209
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,160
Are you...

210
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,720
Are you the father of Cao Yangguang?

211
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,080
I didn't let you in.

212
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,640
The father of Cao Yangguang.

213
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,280
Please call the police.

214
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
Let me introduce myself.

215
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm the manager of this manor.

216
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,880
My surname is Lin.

217
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,040
You can call me Lin.

218
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,480
Lin.

219
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,360
OK.

220
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Let me briefly introduce

221
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,400
our manor.

222
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
The scenery of our manor

223
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,720
is very beautiful.

224
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,440
There are kitchens,

225
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
restaurants and activities in our manor.

226
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960
There is also a fishing area

227
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,760
to satisfy all the needs of the team.

228
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,640
This is our staff's office.

229
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,720
You can have a look.

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
Three cats and three dogs.

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,920
There is a cow and a chicken.

232
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,440
There is a man.

233
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,520
He is wearing a dress.

234
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,280
OK.

235
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,800
Buddy.

236
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,120
Buddy, hello.

237
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,040
This is the first bag.

238
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,960
Right, guys.

239
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,840
Your gathering point is in front.

240
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,720
I have something else to do.

241
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
I won't accompany you anymore, OK?

242
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,560
OK.

243
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
I wish you a good gathering.

244
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,440
OK.

245
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,240
Go.

246
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,760
Buddy, go.

247
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,360
Buddy.

248
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,440
Buddy.

249
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,800
Everybody.

250
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,680
The gathering point is here.

251
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
He has a ring.

252
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,560
Sing a song with him.

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,320
Do you know me?

254
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,560
How far is the distance?

255
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,520
Be careful.

256
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,640
Wait, don't move, Zhang Lihe.

257
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,560
Don't.

258
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,240
Don't disturb him.

259
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,120
They are really good.

260
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
They really have it.

261
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,760
Let's go.

262
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,280
Is there any clue?

263
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,920
No.

264
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
There is no case today.

265
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,320
This is the camping kitchen.

266
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,280
We stay here every day.

267
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,640
No, I think.

268
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,640
What is this?

269
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,320
Nothing.

270
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Is there any clue?

271
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,160
No.

272
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,000
No.

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
No.

274
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,400
You guys are in a state of being in advance.

275
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,560
This should not be so fast.

276
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Or there are a few sentences in English.

277
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,920
Say three sentences.

278
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,920
Tuan Junqing, please go straight ahead.

279
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
It's in there.

280
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
OK.

281
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm so tired.

282
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
I'm so tired.

283
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I'm so tired.

284
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm so tired.

285
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm so tired.

286
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm so tired.

287
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm so tired.

288
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I'm so tired.

289
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,840
Wow.

290
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,440
OK, let's welcome everyone again.

291
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,080
Welcome Henry, Mo Jingyu

292
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,920
to the third season of Start the Rookie.

293
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,760
Since it's the team building

294
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,240
for the third season of Start the Rookie,

295
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,400
we hope

296
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,440
everyone can improve their tacit understanding.

297
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,400
At the same time,

298
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,240
we also hope that everyone can complete the task

299
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,400
and get the Buff Card

300
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,560
for the third season of Start the Rookie.

301
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,520
Buff Card.

302
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,040
The Buff Card will help you

303
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,120
in the next process of your case.

304
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
The clue of the murderer.

305
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,040
The key evidence.

306
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,480
Who is X?

307
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Yes.

308
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,600
Is it a Buff Card that can be used by all the teams?

309
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,920
Next,

310
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,400
let's start our first challenge.

311
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
The first activity is called

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,040
Take a photo of me.

313
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,360
Everyone needs to take a group of promotional photos

314
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,160
for the third season of Start the Rookie.

315
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,080
You have one hour to take photos.

316
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,040
After the time is up,

317
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
please choose six photos

318
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,960
to print.

319
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,080
Five single photos of other players

320
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,800
and one of their group photos.

321
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,720
Finally, you and 30 staffs

322
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,560
vote together.

323
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,840
The first two in the number of votes

324
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,240
can draw the Buff Card for the third season.

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,520
The photo tool is decided by the blind box.

326
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,680
Those who get the CCD camera

327
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,040
can't use the camera.

328
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,520
They can only take photos in the blind box.

329
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,920
It's simple.

330
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,120
Really?

331
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,240
This one.

332
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,400
The CCD camera.

333
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Those who get the CCD camera

334
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,680
can only take six photos.

335
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,400
I should

336
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,720
take photos with this.

337
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm wearing the camera today.

338
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,160
There's a song.

339
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,960
Those who get the single camera

340
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,520
can only take photos with this.

341
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
There must be an animal in the garden.

342
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,680
I'm a phone.

343
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,320
It's okay.

344
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,960
Good.

345
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,160
Those who get the phone

346
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,200
can only press the shutter button with their toes.

347
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,080
Toes.

348
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
Really?

349
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,600
Great.

350
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,400
Great.

351
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,200
No.

352
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,840
Wait.

353
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,160
Great.

354
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Do you know how many pairs I'm wearing today?

355
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,840
Four pairs.

356
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,280
I'm totally...

357
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,200
It's okay. We just need to cut it.

358
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,360
Because we can't take it off.

359
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
There's a way.

360
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,080
You can take photos in the countdown.

361
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,320
Select the photo.

362
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,080
Put your feet on it.

363
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,200
You're smart.

364
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,680
How to take photos?

365
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,400
What's this?

366
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
How to take photos?

367
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,320
This...

368
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,120
This...

369
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,160
It suits you.

370
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,680
You're the younger brother, right?

371
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,760
Children's watch.

372
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,600
It suits you.

373
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,120
How to take photos?

374
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,040
Those who get the phone

375
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,920
can only study the method by themselves.

376
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,960
Yours is more...

377
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,880
No.

378
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,640
This is a drone.

379
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,480
This must be the first place.

380
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,680
This is so cool.

381
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,800
It suits him.

382
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,120
Because he doesn't want to play at all.

383
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,280
I can take photos of you.

384
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,680
Yes.

385
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,400
Why is this the only one I have?

386
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,680
Great.

387
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,440
Those who get the drone

388
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,520
can only study the method by themselves.

389
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,800
No specific requirements.

390
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,400
Okay.

391
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,880
Can you play this?

392
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,600
It doesn't matter.

393
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
If you can't get it,

394
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,440
you can cry.

395
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,880
I don't want to see your tears

396
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
fall on your cheeks.

397
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll go first.

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,320
Take a photo first.

399
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,960
Can you?

400
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,840
Okay.

401
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,040
Come on.

402
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,360
Come on.

403
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,480
So casual?

404
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
Actually, this is a very cool way

405
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
to take photos.

406
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,680
But you have to click on the screen.

407
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,240
They're all here.

408
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,560
Cool.

409
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,400
Let's see.

410
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Is there any Yu?

411
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,360
Yes.

412
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,280
Let's take a look.

413
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,440
It's pretty nice.

414
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,920
It's a bit like a horror movie.

415
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Good.

416
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,120
No need to be beautiful.

417
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,880
You can just take photos.

418
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,960
Let's take a solo photo.

419
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
Come on.

420
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,440
Okay.

421
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,600
Let's take a walk around

422
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,320
and see which place is suitable.

423
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,720
I want to know how to turn on the camera.

424
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,600
Is it?

425
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,040
Yes.

426
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,240
It just turned on.

427
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,680
It's on.

428
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,400
Great.

429
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,120
You didn't turn it on.

430
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,280
You didn't turn it on.

431
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,680
I said it.

432
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,320
Don't take photos.

433
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,720
Sorry.

434
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,280
I just took photos.

435
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,480
Only one hour.

436
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Let Ke Yu finish taking photos first.

437
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,960
You take photos.

438
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,920
Where do you want to take photos?

439
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Hurry up.

440
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
The model is here.

441
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Friends.

442
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,160
Hurry up.

443
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,600
It's your turn.

444
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,280
Hurry up.

445
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,240
Take photos first.

446
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,520
Hurry up.

447
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
I've already set up my pose.

448
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,320
Don't move.

449
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Bro.

450
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
Am I good?

451
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,200
You're so handsome.

452
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm so handsome.

453
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,880
The assassin is coming.

454
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,680
Can you do it?

455
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,840
Don't hit us.

456
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,960
It's too hard.

457
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,200
I'll take his photo.

458
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,520
I feel so good.

459
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,560
Look, I took a photo for Bai.

460
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,880
Isn't it artistic?

461
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
Good.

462
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,560
I'll take one for you.

463
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,240
Yes, you take photos.

464
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,920
I'll take photos of you.

465
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,720
Pretend you're here.

466
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,160
Good.

467
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,640
I...

468
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,480
No.

469
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,920
How did you grow up?

470
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,560
You're so beautiful.

471
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,280
This person is really beautiful.

472
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,400
What's so beautiful about this person?

473
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,720
Don't laugh.

474
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Yes.

475
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,280
You're so noble.

476
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,320
How could you do that?

477
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,360
Let's take photos.

478
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,320
Oh my god.

479
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,040
Dilireba's side view.

480
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,360
I'm crazy.

481
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,280
I'm crazy.

482
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,040
Where are your feet?

483
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,880
Foot.

484
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,840
My feet?

485
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,880
Then I have to sit here.

486
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,640
It's beautiful.

487
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,320
I want to take a photo.

488
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,440
Really?

489
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,080
Is it okay?

490
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,720
This theme is called the Golden Sword Hook.

491
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,920
Hold the legs up and you shout.

492
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,840
I can't sit here.

493
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,280
You don't know how to stand up either.

494
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,520
Can you hear us?

495
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,400
You put this on your ears

496
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,320
Can you take a picture of me?

497
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,480
Take a picture and let you end

498
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,040
OK

499
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
You squat down, OK?

500
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,480
Too high

501
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,080
It's OK

502
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:39,260
This is the kind of

503
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,840
OK

504
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,080
OK

505
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,240
There is a good spot here

506
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,840
Change a place

507
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Go, no problem

508
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,280
I just took a picture of you, you are so beautiful

509
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,000
Really?

510
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,480
I want to sue you

511
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,000
I want to sue you for your work

512
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,800
Sue you

513
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,480
Look, he took a picture of me

514
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,080
I want to laugh

515
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,640
This

516
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,720
I don't know

517
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,000
Can I get the first place?

518
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,040
OK

519
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,640
Your card is not connected to you

520
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm really looking for a lawyer

521
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,040
No, Dayu

522
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,560
It's a bit noisy

523
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,520
You keep following me

524
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
It's noisy

525
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,760
I have no choice

526
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,280
Let's go

527
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,040
Here, it's beautiful here

528
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,320
OK

529
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
There is the first one

530
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,560
Really handsome

531
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,160
You are so relaxed

532
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
You are so handsome

533
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,000
Really handsome

534
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,640
Dayu, what should I do?

535
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,920
You are so relaxed

536
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
You are so handsome

537
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,280
Really

538
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
And mine, right?

539
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,960
Yes

540
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,640
Is it here?

541
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,160
Yes

542
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,760
Really

543
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,520
Really

544
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,280
Really

545
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,000
Really

546
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,640
Really

547
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Really

548
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,280
Really

549
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Really

550
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,000
Really

551
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
Really

552
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,960
Is it here?

553
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,080
No

554
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,840
They are all here

555
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,120
It's okay, just walk around

556
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,280
I'll find another place to take pictures later

557
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,320
Where to take pictures?

558
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,160
Here

559
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,040
Come on

560
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,880
This

561
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,480
Here

562
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,920
Here we go

563
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,520
One, two, three

564
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,760
Perfect

565
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,480
A little umbrella

566
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
This umbrella is so beautiful

567
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,480
A little umbrella

568
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,720
Really beautiful

569
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,520
Your clothes are also beautiful

570
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,920
I want to sit on the blue chair

571
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,200
Take this white umbrella

572
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,200
You have to sit on the same chair as me

573
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,800
Yes

574
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,480
Three, two, one

575
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,400
Nice

576
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,040
Help me find an animal

577
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,960
No, don't go

578
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,280
You don't have to follow me

579
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,560
You don't have to follow the animal

580
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,440
I want to take pictures with you

581
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,000
I want to take pictures with you

582
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,320
You can take pictures with me

583
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,120
You take pictures

584
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,280
This feels good

585
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,560
Right?

586
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,840
This watch is good

587
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,360
Come on, everyone

588
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,680
There is something inside

589
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,520
Go, go, go

590
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,240
Go in

591
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,320
The dog was just here

592
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,680
Can you go out?

593
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,920
You can't go out, you can't go out

594
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,680
Come back

595
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,040
Brother is so domineering

596
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,960
I like it

597
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm speechless

598
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,680
I'm speechless

599
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,760
I feel the smell of animals

600
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,800
There is a smell

601
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,880
But I didn't see it

602
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Let's see what this is

603
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,040
Your animal

604
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
That eight brother

605
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,720
Why are you in there?

606
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,520
Come on, come on

607
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
He's just staying there

608
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,360
Very happy

609
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,000
Can you take a picture?

610
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,920
So handsome

611
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,680
Awesome, invincible

612
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,160
OK

613
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,720
OK

614
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,360
I feel like this card is mine

615
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,560
Sorry

616
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm a buff

617
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,000
Where is the cat?

618
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,640
I saw it

619
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,360
Over there

620
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,320
Hurry up

621
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,040
Here

622
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,880
Come on

623
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
Hurry up

624
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
OK, this side face is awesome

625
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,520
I'm so comfortable

626
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,440
Are you comfortable?

627
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,240
Your cat is so comfortable

628
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
Wait a minute

629
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,880
What are you doing?

630
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,560
This, this

631
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,760
Xiaolun, Xiaolun

632
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,800
Come on

633
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,280
How to get up?

634
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,520
What are you doing?

635
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,280
What's wrong fever?

636
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,520
Why are you, Fire?

637
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Is there any animal?

638
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,720
Where are the cats?

639
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,240
Did you find them?

640
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,200
No

641
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,440
That cat

642
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,040
Tmg Cat

643
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:04,920
Outer share

644
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
Different

645
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,600
Different

646
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,320
Rhino

647
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,760
Brother Ning

648
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,760
There is a fly here

649
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,640
Isn't it an animal?

650
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm not a micro-chopper

651
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,040
I can't shoot the fly

652
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,000
It ran away

653
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,880
Hurry up, it's okay

654
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,760
Hurry up, as long as you have a foot

655
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,960
You can stand here

656
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,400
Stand here, OK

657
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,560
Done

658
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,200
Handsome

659
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,760
Cool

660
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,400
Perfect

661
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,040
No group shot

662
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,080
No group shot

663
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,600
What about the group shot?

664
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,480
What about you?

665
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,040
There are five people in the group shot

666
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,840
There is no group shot

667
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,560
Come on, sit down

668
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,880
You are handsome

669
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,320
Smart face

670
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,600
You are the best

671
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,080
Sit down

672
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,120
Come on, you sit down

673
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,360
Let's do face-to-face

674
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,560
No

675
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,520
Sister Li is happy

676
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,480
Your distance is your arm

677
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,240
Then touch my fingers

678
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,440
That's the best distance

679
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,880
Our face is too big

680
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,320
Remove the door

681
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,720
Come on

682
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,600
One, two, three

683
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,960
Got it

684
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,640
This is good

685
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,920
You go, I'll take a picture

686
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,680
Come on, everyone

687
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,720
Come on, brother

688
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,360
One, two, three

689
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,640
Three, two, one

690
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,160
Sister, take a picture with a cow, okay?

691
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,360
Is it very cowish to touch the fish?

692
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,840
That's what I mean

693
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,400
Come on

694
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,200
Yes

695
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,240
The last one

696
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,040
Come on, come on

697
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,080
Come on, come on

698
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,880
Or you can't take a picture with a cow

699
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,440
Okay, okay

700
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,320
Thank you

701
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,280
Let's go

702
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,560
Let's go back and hand in the task

703
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,400
It's warm

704
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,080
They arranged it next to the stove

705
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,400
Each person chooses six pictures

706
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,640
that they are most satisfied with from the photos

707
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,520
Only a few

708
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,640
Look at this man's taste

709
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,760
Look at the essence in his neck

710
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,800
He's hardworking

711
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,600
I won

712
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,080
I have to say that this one is really good

713
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,880
Really

714
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,280
Right?

715
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
It's like a movie

716
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,040
This one

717
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,680
Brother Bai's picture of the He Nan god

718
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,680
This photo is good

719
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,760
Bai Yu, this one feels like stealing corn

720
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,480
There's no way because you have to wear this cat

721
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,440
It's not like stealing corn

722
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,120
It's like being a farmer who stole corn

723
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,000
A farmer who stole corn

724
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,200
Choose a few

725
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,400
Choose six

726
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,880
Each person's single photo plus the photo of He

727
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,760
Each person's single photo

728
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,000
I can still have a single photo in my machine

729
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,920
My machine can be used by all of you

730
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,880
I still have a machine

731
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,800
How to play this

732
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,360
Brother, you are too realistic

733
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,120
The machine is hard to control

734
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,240
I'm not good at it either

735
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,960
Bai

736
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,680
He's just a miner

737
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,600
Anyway, no matter what you take in here

738
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,040
As long as it's you

739
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,400
What are you doing?

740
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,080
I put it on the edge

741
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,680
Put it on the edge

742
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,960
You took it so handsome

743
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,480
He took it so silly

744
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,120
OK, that's it

745
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,920
I think it's good

746
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,280
Can this work?

747
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,840
Bai

748
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,360
I'm so wide

749
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,120
How can I open your window

750
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,840
What are you doing?

751
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,400
You let it out

752
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,280
This is our

753
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,560
In this industry

754
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,840
I tell you a lot of people

755
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,480
Really

756
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,520
All black

757
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,440
Director, you are

758
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,960
It's hard to operate

759
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,720
You'd better be a producer

760
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,000
OK

761
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,240
You have to look at your photo like this

762
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,800
It's too hard

763
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,720
No more

764
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,120
Why is it only Jin Jin and myself?

765
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,280
And a hot bar

766
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,240
It's over

767
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,600
Later, he waited for a long time

768
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,320
He turned off himself

769
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,920
Then when you pressed it again

770
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,640
You didn't see that switch

771
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,840
You didn't see that switch

772
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,560
Switch

773
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,640
It's OK

774
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:13,880
It's OK

775
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,360
It's OK

776
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,000
No

777
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,000
Actually, it's on purpose

778
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,800
He did it on purpose

779
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,880
He must have done it on purpose

780
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,200
I love it so much

781
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,040
You didn't press it

782
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,800
It's OK

783
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,080
You didn't press it

784
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,800
It's OK

785
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,280
It's OK

786
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,080
You didn't press it

787
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,720
It's OK

788
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,200
It's OK

789
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,760
It's OK

790
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,320
It's OK

791
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,120
You didn't press it

792
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,000
You are

793
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,160
It's okay

794
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,120
No

795
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,000
Who do you need now

796
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,200
I'll take a picture with you

797
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,600
Come on, I'll find an angle

798
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,120
So the props

799
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
Perfect

800
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,400
Every photo looks better than the other one

801
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,480
Come on, another photo

802
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,440
It's over

803
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,960
We can stack up

804
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,240
Come on, stack up

805
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,320
Three, two, one

806
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,560
I won

807
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,520
I'm sure I won

808
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,880
Ke Yu

809
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,080
Why is this dog not close to people at all

810
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,120
He's afraid of you

811
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,640
You know you're a bad guy when you look at you

812
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,520
Okay

813
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,320
He washed it out, didn't he

814
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,040
It's washed out

815
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,840
Okay

816
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,000
This one

817
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,680
Look at you

818
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,480
I really won this double-open door

819
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,920
Who took this

820
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,560
I took it

821
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,520
This set is really important

822
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,160
Very feel

823
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,440
Yes, it's very good in color

824
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,120
The last shot is actually the best

825
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,880
Everyone's expression is very strong

826
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,560
Yes, this is a high level

827
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,080
Not bad

828
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,320
So cute

829
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,400
What's wrong with Zhang Linghan

830
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,800
I took a picture of you

831
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,240
It's so cool, Lao Tie

832
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,120
I took this

833
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,840
Little genius

834
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,200
This is the effect of the little genius

835
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,840
This one

836
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,000
This is good

837
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,880
Right?

838
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,960
Not bad

839
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,920
It's taken on the novel

840
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,120
It's pretty good

841
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,760
Zhou Keyu

842
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,680
Your photo is so poor

843
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,400
Why

844
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Because the staff voted

845
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,240
Actually, you can see it from the back of the board

846
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,200
There is a vote

847
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,320
Because you can't put it down

848
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,400
But yours is my photo

849
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,000
But yours is completely not revealed

850
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,440
It's a white one

851
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
Only your group of photos

852
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,200
You are right

853
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,000
None of them are revealed

854
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,280
It's all out, look

855
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,200
Yes, we all reported

856
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,280
I see

857
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,720
This is good

858
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,600
Come on, brother, take the first shot

859
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,360
Come on

860
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,320
This is also good

861
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,200
Wait a minute

862
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,400
Mr. Bai Yu

863
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,800
Did you vote for two of my photos

864
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,840
Where

865
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,720
Where did you vote for two

866
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,400
One of this

867
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,040
You

868
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,160
No

869
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,520
It's a little biased, right

870
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,640
Don't die

871
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,760
Just like this

872
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,360
I

873
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,440
Go

874
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,400
OK, I'll vote

875
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,640
I think our group photos are all beautiful

876
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,520
Really

877
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,400
I think so, too

878
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,640
Don't you vote for a white one

879
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,360
No need to vote for me

880
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,960
I don't vote for brother Bai

881
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,320
I have to vote for the one I like

882
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,960
Yes

883
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,920
Three coaches

884
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,160
I didn't vote for myself

885
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,760
I voted for Zhou Keyu

886
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,720
He voted for the refrigerator

887
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,240
He voted for the refrigerator

888
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,320
I voted for Dilirek

889
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,920
OK

890
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,280
Dilirek

891
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,880
This one

892
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,120
This one is beautiful

893
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,400
I didn't see this one just now

894
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,000
Can't change

895
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,800
Don't do this to us, Xiaoqin

896
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,400
Give him one of this group

897
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,360
It's all a pity vote

898
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,560
No need

899
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,760
You can vote for the one you like

900
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,040
You don't need to do that

901
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,600
Really?

902
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,400
Vote for the one you like

903
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,840
I really like this one

904
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,080
I voted for the end

905
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,480
Done

906
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:29,880
OK

907
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,080
Sorry, genius

908
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,440
I think the genius

909
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,480
I think we should encourage him

910
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,880
Just vote for our group photos

911
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,160
Because we can't choose

912
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,920
But what's so beautiful about it

913
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,520
I think this one

914
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,280
Jinjin took a very good photo of me

915
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,240
I like this one, too

916
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,200
This one is really great

917
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,040
Too big

918
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,240
Yes, it's very big

919
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,440
The white one is also beautiful

920
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,880
This one

921
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,040
I don't need to encourage

922
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,680
Not encourage

923
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,120
But this one is very story-like

924
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,520
Yes

925
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,240
Right?

926
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,040
It's very lively

927
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,400
Just like our daily life

928
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,680
This is really like a tour

929
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,160
Yes

930
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,880
The last one

931
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,640
I think this one is beautiful

932
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,360
Perfect

933
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,640
This one is really perfect

934
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,320
The eyes are staring at each other

935
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,360
I don't know what's on his back

936
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,600
I even voted

937
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,320
This one

938
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,080
It seems that he needs this

939
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,680
to vote for Xiao Tian

940
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,360
Yes, I like this one very much

941
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,520
Why are you all voting for me

942
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,000
Wait a minute

943
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,400
It's okay

944
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,880
This one seems to be more than you

945
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,080
There are photos taken by Brother Lan

946
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,800
Yes

947
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,080
What's this

948
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,880
I think it's worth a vote

949
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,480
I don't want

950
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,920
What's this

951
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,120
This one is really good

952
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,320
Yes, this one is really good

953
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,000
It's very atmospheric

954
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,280
Actually, it's more balanced, right?

955
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,640
Yes

956
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,640
What should I do

957
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,840
I still want to vote for myself

958
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,760
I have two more

959
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
Do you like this group

960
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,520
Can you choose

961
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,640
Look

962
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,600
This side is fine

963
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,160
Very sensual

964
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,200
I'm voting

965
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,320
How can you recommend yourself

966
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,480
Recommend

967
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,920
You can vote here

968
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,880
You can vote here

969
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,200
You can vote for two

970
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,080
No, I think it's like this

971
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,320
I think this group photo is worth a vote

972
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,960
Really

973
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,320
The group photo is really very sensual

974
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,520
Yes, this one is good

975
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,440
Then I think I can vote for Zhang Junfei

976
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,480
Zhang Junfei, I said no

977
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,520
Because I can't see his face

978
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,960
I can't see his face

979
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,120
He feels like a single-legged monster now

980
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,960
He's voting

981
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,320
It's f crossover

982
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,240
I can see my face

983
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,280
The bastard

984
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,680
Thanks

985
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,160
Really

986
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,920
Don't worry

987
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,200
I won't liked

988
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,280
Look

989
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,080
Wait

990
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,320
So I can't vote for myself

991
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,000
What can I do

992
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,840
What can I do

993
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,200
Do what you want

994
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,320
Live

995
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,520
Because you and me

996
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,320
have only one lie

997
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,800
That's just like me

998
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:11,720
She himself is pretty

999
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,240
I feel comfortable

1000
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:13,960
Thank you

1001
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,080
I feel like vegetables

1002
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,920
HEY if you don't believe in me

1003
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm afraid it depends on what you guys found

1004
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:40,360
I can only give you the

1005
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,840
National Hero

1006
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,600
I can give you the

1007
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,240
National Hero

1008
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,520
So speechless

1009
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,320
So speechless

1010
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,440
No way

1011
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,800
People are so handsome

1012
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,760
They are handsome in every shot

1013
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,120
You say

1014
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,720
I'm so speechless

1015
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,520
I really

1016
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,760
Now this season

1017
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,800
I've already felt

1018
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,920
A lot of crisis

1019
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,600
People are so handsome

1020
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,560
They are handsome in every shot

1021
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,760
You say

1022
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,880
In my choice

1023
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,160
In my choice

1024
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,720
This is very handsome

1025
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,760
This is not

1026
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,240
Very

1027
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,200
Thank you

1028
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,880
You have a good taste

1029
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
I really have to say Zhang Linhe

1030
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,560
Handsome and good taste

1031
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Handsome and good taste

1032
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
I have to vote for this one first

1033
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,360
Look at this boy

1034
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,880
Zhang Linhe, I think you are a little kind

1035
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,000
You should vote for me

1036
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,080
Is it not good?

1037
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,280
I took it for you

1038
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,800
I also vote for myself

1039
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,320
This one is also very good

1040
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,240
I took a very handsome photo for you

1041
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,040
OK?

1042
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,440
Do you know what this photo looks like?

1043
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:42,680
What?

1044
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,880
Like full of food

1045
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,320
You see, you are very unhurried

1046
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,440
Very handsome

1047
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,800
You call me a good boy

1048
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,440
Young master

1049
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,560
Then I'll vote for a photo together

1050
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,720
Vote for a photo together

1051
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,920
Support Little Tian

1052
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,520
Thank you, young master

1053
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,960
OK, I've voted

1054
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,840
I've voted

1055
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,400
Successful

1056
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,440
I've voted

1057
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,160
End

1058
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,400
You estimated that you have a few photos

1059
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,440
The staff voted

1060
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,480
Not a few

1061
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,680
Not a few

1062
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,960
It's the same as we guessed

1063
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,120
Little genius

1064
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,880
That's good, actually

1065
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,240
The votes have been counted

1066
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,800
OK

1067
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,720
Let's take a look at your vote

1068
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,640
Which one is the highest photo?

1069
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,120
OK

1070
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,320
Four

1071
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,440
Two fours

1072
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,280
Congratulations to Zhang Linhe and Zhang Ke Yu

1073
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,960
Get the highest number of votes

1074
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm on the list

1075
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,320
That little genius

1076
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,840
It's purely sponsored

1077
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,880
Little genius, I think I should encourage you

1078
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,600
I know

1079
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,800
Support Little genius

1080
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,280
OK, I'll do it

1081
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,880
Our friendship is

1082
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,760
How can you say that?

1083
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Because I can't pick anything else

1084
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,840
Two people

1085
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,760
I'm the other one

1086
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,360
So nervous

1087
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,440
So nervous

1088
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,760
He doesn't have to be nervous

1089
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,800
There seems to be nothing behind

1090
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,600
I thought he chose the photo

1091
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,560
I don't know

1092
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,940
Stirring

1093
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,560
I wanted to chooseん

1094
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,920
【Thinking】

1095
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:30,260
Sprinkle

1096
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,620
lack of expression

1097
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,720
I feel like I saw the!!

1098
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,560
It's my eye

1099
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,600
There's something wrong?

1100
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,440
Isn't there a Drawing Chess notion in training list

1101
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,880
He should have a lot of votes

1102
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,360
30

1103
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,520
35

1104
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,640
38 votes

1105
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,880
So great

1106
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,560
Look at you

1107
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,640
I got it for you

1108
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,240
Really

1109
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,520
The importance of talent

1110
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,320
Right

1111
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,560
45 votes

1112
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,000
Now we are the first two

1113
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,880
You are the first, I am the second

1114
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
See if anyone can squeeze me out

1115
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,840
There are many people over there

1116
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Reba

1117
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,840
Oh, no, you are squeezed out

1118
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,960
This is a direct win

1119
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,760
You don't have to look at the back

1120
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,840
Brother Bai, don't come in

1121
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,440
I see

1122
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,400
What?

1123
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
I'll help him

1124
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,480
I won

1125
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,360
15 votes is too miserable

1126
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,760
It's okay, brother, but you are handsome

1127
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,560
No, I'm not

1128
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,920
This is mine

1129
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,320
30

1130
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,400
I won

1131
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Can we get the buff?

1132
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,720
Yes

1133
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,760
We will win, brother

1134
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,800
This machine will look at us

1135
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,160
Look

1136
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,880
The top three of the top players

1137
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,400
Really

1138
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,040
The top three of the top players

1139
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,640
You see, usually

1140
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,320
You don't play games often

1141
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,560
Decide D card

1142
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,120
What is the Decide D card?

1143
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,280
Decide the personality of a certain player

1144
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,360
For example, to specify someone being a lunatic in the N phase

1145
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,360
What?

1146
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,840
Lunatic

1147
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,040
Being a lunatic

1148
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
You can decide the personality

1149
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,560
Who does he like

1150
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,520
What kind of growth experience

1151
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,280
This kind of

1152
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,520
We will be the emotional screenwriters

1153
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,160
OK

1154
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,440
You are a lunatic, what will you do?

1155
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,960
Brother, what is this?

1156
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,480
Xiao Ji

1157
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,720
Here

1158
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,520
She's lying

1159
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,380
Peach

1160
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,720
I just said you heal

1161
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,400
Wait a minute

1162
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,080
That's not good

1163
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,720
come on

1164
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:23,120
I can't

1165
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,440
Come on

1166
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,120
Brother, why

1167
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,640
I encounter a problem

1168
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,260
Right

1169
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,040
the Rap Tomato

1170
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,720
Tell me

1171
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,360
Yes

1172
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,600
clap

1173
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,200
end

1174
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
The first round of the game is decided by the players

1175
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
The first round of the game is decided by the players

1176
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Come on

1177
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Listen to my voice

1178
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Players need to draw lots and divide into three groups

1179
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Challenge in turn

1180
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
When challenging, both of them need to wear headphones

1181
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,200
One person looks at the topic and says the content of the topic

1182
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
The other person guesses the topic

1183
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Which group can guess more words in eight minutes?

1184
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
The winning group

1185
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
The winning group can draw the third season's buff card

1186
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
OK

1187
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Whoever draws it, I'm blessed

1188
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Come on

1189
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
One

1190
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
I'm one, too

1191
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Three

1192
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
I can't draw

1193
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
OK, come on

1194
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
One

1195
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,200
One

1196
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,200
One

1197
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
One

1198
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
I am

1199
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
OK

1200
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
We won

1201
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
You pick him

1202
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Who

1203
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
You

1204
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
What's wrong?

1205
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
We're all standing

1206
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
You sit down and eat a melon

1207
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
What are you doing?

1208
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
How can I play like this?

1209
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
You have to learn to be independent

1210
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Xiao Wei is not that kind of person

1211
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
But you are that kind of person

1212
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
You are lazy

1213
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
But you are an idol

1214
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
I'm not good at this kind of game

1215
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Let me guess

1216
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
You guess, right?

1217
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Yes, I'm good at guessing

1218
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Let's see why they don't play

1219
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
We can

1220
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Learn

1221
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Come on

1222
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
You two will lose

1223
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
No, just kidding

1224
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Come on

1225
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
You draw a few words first

1226
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
OK

1227
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
OK

1228
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Come on

1229
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
I'm good at guessing

1230
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
There's no sound

1231
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
It's too loud

1232
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Good at drawing

1233
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Lazy

1234
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Old man

1235
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Wait a minute

1236
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
I haven't shown it to him yet

1237
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
I haven't shown it to him yet

1238
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Just matured into a human being

1239
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
What did you say?

1240
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
What did you say?

1241
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
Let's see if it's idle

1242
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Yes

1243
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Let's start

1244
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
I'm still trying to open the door

1245
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Ten words

1246
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Ten words

1247
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,200
You can't be by my side

1248
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Without sister

1249
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
You can't be by my side

1250
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,200
You can't be by my side

1251
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
Can

1252
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
Can

1253
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
Can

1254
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Can

1255
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
By my side

1256
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,200
By my side

1257
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Can't be

1258
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
Can't be

1259
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,960
Call me

1260
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,960
Can you hear it over there

1261
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,280
Sing songs

1262
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Do the pose

1263
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,580
Pose

1264
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,880
So tired

1265
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,000
Hanging

1266
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
Five colors

1267
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Dilireba

1268
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
A night of light

1269
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
A night of light

1270
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Follow

1271
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200

00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Take off

A night of light

1277
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Correct

1278
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Five words

Me

1284
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
The first word is me

1285
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Me

1286
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
No

1287
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,200

1308
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,200
This

1309
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Jiawei

1310
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
His throat is going to break for a while

1311
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
His throat is dumb

1312
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,200
His throat is dumb

1313
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,200
I can't

1316
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Change

1317
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
Exchange

Guess one now

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,200
Pass

1321
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
We win

1322
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,200
The first word is push

1323
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200

1324
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200

Push hundred birds

1334
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
Six words

1335
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,200
The first word is round

1336
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,200

Round oil

1346
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,200
I think we should change the word

1347
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,200
The third word is head

1348
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,200

The sixth word is pig

1357
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,200
There is a pig at the head

1358
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
Look, is it a joke?

1359
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
There is a pig at the head

1360
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Pick

1361
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,200
Pick

1362
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,200

Pig

1368
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,200
The fifth word is

Round oil head, pick, pig

1373
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Is it right?

1374
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,200
Actually it is right

1375
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,200
Round oil head, pick oil

1376
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,200
It's so hard

1377
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,200

1378
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,200
Round oil head, pick oil pig

00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,200
I can't live without my dad

00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,200
The night is dark

1381
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Round oil head, pick oil pig

1382
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,200
We are all talking about the third word

00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,200
The third word is

1384
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
Let's go

1385
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Come on

1386
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200

Master, you can go to eat

1404
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,200

Yes, our good

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,200
Do you know why?

1408
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Why?

1409
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Because your beard affects the shape of your mouth

1410
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Let's go to eat

1411
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,200

Really

1423
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,200
You

1434
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,200

1437
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
Much more than us

1438
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,200
Let him fall into the sink

1439
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,200
This

1440
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,200

I feel like they will be like this when they get old

1449
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,200
What did you say?

1450
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,200
Let him

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,200
Kill him

1452
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200

00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Turn him into me

1563
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,200
The devil is speechless

1564
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,200
Turn him into me

1565
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Princess

1566
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Princess

1567
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Princess

1568
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,200
Princess

1569
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,200

Please

1574
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,200
Please open the door

1575
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,200
The princess hasn't opened it yet

1576
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,200
The princess has opened the door for you

1577
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,200
Please open the door

1578
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,200
Please open the door

1579
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,200
Please open the door

1580
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,200
Oh, no

1581
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,200
I feel a little bit scared

1582
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,200
Snow

1583
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Snow

1584
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
Big

1585
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,200
Big

1586
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,200
Jump

1587
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,200
Big

1588
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,200
Big

1589
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,200
Small

1590
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,200
Small

1591
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,200
Small

1592
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,200
The

1593
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,200
The devil

1594
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,200
Big

1595
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,200
Small

1596
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,200
The devil

1597
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,200
Big

1598
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,200
The devil

1599
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,200
Small

1600
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,200
Let's see how they don't play

1601
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,200
We can

1602
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Study

1603
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,200
Big

1604
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,200
Big

1605
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Small

1606
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
Small

1607
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,200
Eye

1608
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,200
The big eye

1609
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,200
So awesome

1610
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
Come on

1611
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Come on

1612
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,200
God

1613
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,200
The corner

1614
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,200
The corner

1615
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,200
Handsome

1616
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,200
101

1617
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,200
Handsome 101

1618
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,200
I only look at

1619
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Handcuffs

1620
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
This pair of handcuffs is my personal favorite

1621
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,200
So awesome

1622
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,200
Oh, no

1623
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,200
This handcuffs

1624
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
Oh, right

1625
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,200
The spirit

1626
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,200
Raise your hand

1627
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,200
I hit you

1628
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,200
Spirit

1629
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Spirit

1630
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,200
Spirit

1631
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,200
Handcuffs

1632
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,200
Handcuffs

1633
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,200
Spirit

1634
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,200
Handcuffs

1635
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
Spirit

1636
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,200
My beans

1637
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,200
OK

1638
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,200
What are you doing?

1639
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,200
It seems to be a human problem

1640
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,200
It's my problem

1641
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,200
I admit

1642
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
I will reflect on my own problem

1643
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,200
all this season

1644
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,200
I will watch your performance

1645
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,200
OK

1646
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,200
You

1647
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,200
Follow me

1648
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,200
Follow me

1649
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,200
At

1650
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
At

1651
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,200
Step with me

1652
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,200
Let's be together

1653
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,200
Let's be together

1654
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,200
Door

1655
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
Door

1656
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
With

1657
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Door

1658
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
With me

1659
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,200
With the cow

1660
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,200
With me

1661
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Let's be together

1662
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,200
So awesome

1663
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,200
You are so awesome

1664
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,200
Great

1665
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
The winner of this round is

1666
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,200
Dilireba and Liu Yuling

1667
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
You can draw a card

1668
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
I don't want to lose anymore

1669
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
Bai Yu

1670
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
It hurts

1671
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
It starts

1672
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,200
Come on

1673
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Decision

1674
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,200
Why is it this again?

1675
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,200
Yes, you have two chances to make a decision

1676
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,200
OK

1677
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Am I going to turn X?

1678
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Three times Dika

1679
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Three times

1680
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,200
Three times

1681
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,200
Decide which episode you want to play

1682
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,200
Your own episode

1683
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,200
That is, if there is one episode

1684
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,200
I can get two

1685
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,200
If there is one episode, I can get two

1686
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,200
If you win

1687
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,200
You can get two

1688
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,200
If you lose, you don't have it, right?

1689
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Which episode I win

1690
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Which episode I use

1691
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,200
Yes

1692
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,200
It's impossible that one episode doesn't win

1693
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,200
Before the start of the period

1694
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
It's okay

1695
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,200
Next is our last round

1696
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,200
The challenge of the card

1697
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Great

1698
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Catch me Dika

1699
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
Catch me Dika

1700
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,200
Each player needs to tie 15 balloons behind

1701
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
There is a card hidden in each balloon

1702
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,200
Players can collect the card by pinching the balloons behind others

1703
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,200
The first two who collect the first two

1704
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,200
can get the third season's buff card

1705
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,200
I heard your voice for the first time

1706
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
I'm sorry

1707
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Battle field, right?

1708
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,200
Let's kill who first

1709
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Come on

1710
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Try to hold high

1711
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,200
It's okay to help me carry it

1712
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,200
It's okay to help me carry it

1713
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,200
My balloons are too low

1714
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,200
They are tall

1715
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,200
We can't reach them

1716
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,200
It's okay to pull the rope

1717
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,200
You give me a chance to pull the rope

1718
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,200
Is it a good idea?

1719
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,200
What's the idea?

1720
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,200
My first suicide test

1721
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
I hold his balloon and turn it down

1722
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,200
Then you pinch his balloon

1723
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,200
But if you get a good card

1724
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,200
You have to share it with me

1725
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,200
How about it?

1726
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,200
He is provoking us

1727
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,200
He wants to win the game

1728
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
Ready

1729
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,200
I'm so nervous

1730
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,200
Start

1731
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,200
I got it

1732
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,200
Don't run

1733
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,200
Can't do this

1734
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,200
Can't do this

1735
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,200
Try it

1736
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,200
You help me continue to draw

1737
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,200
I'm afraid

1738
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,200
Why can't I do it?

1739
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,200
You try

1740
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,200
Fish

1741
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,200
Chicken

1742
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
No

1743
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,200
Fish

1744
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,200
Touch

1745
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,200
Why is it raining so much?

1746
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
I'm stuck

1747
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Touch one

1748
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,200
No

1749
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,200
I give you one

1750
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,200
There is one more

1751
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,200
It's raining

1752
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,200
Okay

1753
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,200
I picked up four

1754
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,200
Fish

1755
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
It's all fish

1756
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
No power

1757
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,200
No power

1758
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Fish

1759
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,200
Okay

1760
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,200
Okay

1761
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,200
He

1762
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
Li

1763
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
Touch

1764
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
Fish

1765
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,200
Game over

1766
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,200
Good job

1767
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
No power

1768
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,200
Come on

1769
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,200
Okay

1770
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,200
I'm so tired

1771
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,200
How about it?

1772
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,200
If we don't play together

1773
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,200
We will

1774
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Come on, Bai Yu

1775
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Two votes

1776
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,200
Your vote is two votes

1777
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,200
This card can't fall into his hands

1778
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
It's over

1779
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
We are really over

1780
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
This is the most useful

1781
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
This is the most stupid

1782
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,200
It's over

1783
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,200
He decided this game

1784
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,200
This game is over

1785
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,200
What card?

1786
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,200
Steal your D-card

1787
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,200
Point one person

1788
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,200
Can take his current key

1789
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,200
Take it

1790
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,200
If he wins

1791
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,200
If he doubles

1792
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,200
I can take his two

1793
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,200
You win

1794
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,200
Really?

1795
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
Then don't use your two cards

1796
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
I don't need it in my life

1797
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,200
Only he doesn't have it

1798
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
Our brother

1799
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Only I don't have it

1800
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,200
How about this

1801
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,200
You perform a show

1802
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,200
Let you take a picture

1803
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,200
No

1804
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,200
I don't want it

1805
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Congratulations

1806
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,200
You have completed all the challenges of the Buff Card

1807
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,200
You can order food for our dinner

1808
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,200
Let's order

1809
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Come on

1810
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,200
Different

1811
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,200
My fresh appetizer

1812
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,200
This is a dish for everyone

1813
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,200
Spicy hot pot chicken

1814
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
Spicy hot pot chicken is delicious

1815
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,200
It sounds delicious

1816
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,200
Spicy hot pot chicken

1817
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Pickled fish

1818
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
OK

1819
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
Chicken soup

1820
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,200
OK, three dishes

1821
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,200
Spicy chili beef

1822
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,200
Spicy potato shreds

1823
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
OK

1824
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,200
OK, let's get ready to serve

1825
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,200
Really?

1826
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,200
Eat now?

1827
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,200
I don't think it's that simple

1828
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,200
It's impossible to eat here

1829
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,200
Serve

1830
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,200
Let's see

1831
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,200
The six dishes you ordered

1832
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,200
Delicious

1833
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,200
Smell this fragrance

1834
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,200
Dijun

1835
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,200
OK

1836
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,200
It's OK to bring us a piece

1837
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,200
Do you want to eat it?

1838
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,200
There are words behind

1839
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,200
What's wrong?

1840
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,200
Do it yourself, right?

1841
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Do it yourself

1842
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,200
The dishes you ordered

1843
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,200
Do it yourself

1844
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Then my meal is so cool

1845
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,200
So cool

1846
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,200
Oh, my God

1847
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,200
So next

1848
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,200
Everyone is going to the market to buy vegetables

1849
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,200
The address of the navigation

1850
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,200
It's written behind this phone

1851
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,200
Start buying vegetables

1852
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,200
Go

1853
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,200
Do we drive ourselves?

1854
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,200
Lend the car

1855
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,200
Old Lin

1856
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,200
Old Lin

1857
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Master Lin

1858
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,200
What's wrong?

1859
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,200
We are going to buy vegetables

1860
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,200
Can you lend us a car?

1861
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,200
You are going to buy vegetables, right?

1862
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,200
Yes

1863
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,200
How many of you?

1864
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,200
One, two, three, four, five, six people

1865
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,200
Six people

1866
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,200
Go to the car

1867
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,200
Then you can use my car

1868
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
OK

1869
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
This is the car key

1870
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,200
OK

1871
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,200
It's parked in the yard in front of the door

1872
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,200
OK

1873
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,200
Where is the vegetable market?

1874
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,200
It's called Li's house

1875
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,200
OK

1876
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
Then we go to buy vegetables

1877
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,200
OK

1878
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,200
Remember to drive back

1879
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,200
I still use that car tonight

1880
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,200
OK

1881
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,200
Don't worry, Master Lin

1882
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,200
The car is for you

1883
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,200
Come on

1884
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,200
Driver

1885
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,200
OK

1886
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,200
Driver

1887
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,200
Did you get the menu?

1888
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,200
Yes

1889
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,200
OK, just take it together

1890
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Don't show the ingredients

1891
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,200
Give it to him

1892
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,200
I'll take care of it

1893
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,200
You take care of it

1894
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,200
OK

1895
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,200
Because you are the most reliable

1896
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
You are reliable

1897
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,200
I'm going home, guys

1898
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,200
We go to the back

1899
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,200
Let's go

1900
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,200
These people are tired

1901
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,200
It's so slippery

1902
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,200
We just crossed the mountains

1903
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,200
Waiting for you to show up

1904
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,200
I went into the red roundabout city

1905
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
Gently approaching

1906
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,200
The car stopped here

1907
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,200
Let's go to your side

1908
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,200
Go home

1909
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,200
Go home?

1910
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,200
Go back or not, I'll just drive him back

1911
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,200
Just go back

1912
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,200
I think we'll drive

1913
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,200
This road

1914
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,200
I think so too

1915
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,200
What are you looking at?

1916
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,200
We're going to eat and chat today

1917
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,400
Brother Ning is here, right?

1918
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,120
Yes

1919
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,520
What does it mean?

1920
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,560
Start cooking

1921
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,360
Start cooking

1922
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,760
Start cooking

1923
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:42,960
Vegetable Farm

1924
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,000
The center of the collection

1925
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,200
This one

1926
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,200
Yes, the center of the collection of agricultural products

1927
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,200
You can lift the lid

1928
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,160
Wait for me

1929
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,440
Hello

1930
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,080
You guys park

1931
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:57,720
Park

1932
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,120
Yes

1933
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,120
The center of the collection of agricultural products

1934
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,160
Artificial step

1935
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,640
Come on, let's go

1936
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,680
Come on

1937
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,040
Don't look at that

1938
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:09,680
What does it mean?

1939
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,360
Go to the side

1940
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,080
Just park here?

1941
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,800
Yes

1942
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,400
OK, it's OK

1943
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,840
I don't understand what he said

1944
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,160
OK, everyone

1945
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,320
Safe arrival

1946
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,440
Why is this phone moving by itself?

1947
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,200
Brother

1948
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:22,880
It's out of control

1949
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,800
What does it mean?

1950
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,560
You have been lost

1951
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,640

01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,480
For example, like this

1981
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,360
Pull clothes or something

1982
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,240
Let's go down one by one

01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:27,800
Take a look

1991
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,160
Why do you have so many

01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,000
This kind of appearance

1993
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,760
This one

Why is there such a big smoke

2004
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:07,920
What's wrong

2005
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,240
What's the problem

2006
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,160
I don't know

2007
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:16,680
How to say

2008
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,520
It's okay

2009
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,920

No fish

01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,000
Who picked the fish

2055
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,760
I only have fish

01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,680
Fish, we can't catch it

2057

Did we enter the cycle?

2101
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,600
Have you ever seen us?

2102
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,600
The one who sees us will forget us after ten minutes

2103
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,600
Are we in the circle?

No

2105
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,600
We can only walk back

You put the knife around her head like this.

2115
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,680
You must have cut it with a knife.

2116
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,000
Even though it's hurt,

01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,480

2125
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,560
