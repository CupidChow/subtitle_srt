00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,680
Welcome to the team building of the third season of the Start to Push the Buzzer

2
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,000
to get the bumper

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,320
Here it comes

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,520
Look, I have my posture ready

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,880
I feel that this bumper is mine

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,320
The pig

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,640
The pig with a pig's head

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,160
The

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,680
pig

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,520
pig

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
pig

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Big

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,800
Big

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Small

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,480
This time it's up to us

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,960
Bull

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,720
Come on

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,040
Let's start buying vegetables

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,640
Hold on

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,560
Why is this phone moving by itself

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,320
Bro

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,000
You can control it

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,120
The car is gone

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,440
The car is gone

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,400
Is it already in the loop

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,760
No car

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,320
Then we can only go back

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,920
Really?

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,160
But the main thing is the owner's car

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,720
The owner said this car was still needed

31
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,680
What should we do

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,320
It's okay

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,640
I actually have a reason

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,560
What can we do

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,720
We can go back

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,760
We can discuss the compensation problem when we go back

37
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,800
We should have left someone to watch the car

38
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,400
I just know that this person said

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,440
He has never seen us come

40
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,560
It's a bit

41
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,840
He said he has never seen us come

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,200
Is it already in the loop

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
Then if we go back to the restaurant

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,160
Can the two people in the restaurant know us

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,960
Try it

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,440
Really

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,360
Are we in the circle now

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,280
The people who have seen us

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,240
Will forget us in ten minutes

50
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,520
Have you ever seen us

51
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,000
You are Fan Linhe

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,000
He said I am Zhang Linhe

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,040
No, Zhou Henan

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
Zhou Henan

55
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Zhou Henan

56
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,240
Yes

57
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,760
Zhou Henan

58
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,600
Zhou Henan

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
We just saw this car

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,120
It was stolen by someone

61
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,040
Have you ever done this before

62
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,600
How did you come here

63
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Which car

64
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,800
It's this person

65
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,720
Do you know this person

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,600
Standing at the door

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,640
I saw them drive over here

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
I saw them drive over here

69
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,680
They came here

70
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
You must drive over here

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,560
Because my legs are fake legs

72
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,280
I can't walk

73
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,760
Then have you seen us

74
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,720
Where did you go first

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
I don't know

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,400
Where did you go first

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,520
Drive over to the farm

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,600
Drive over to the farm

79
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,120
You guys are here to drive over, right

80
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,720
I'm just a few people

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,280
That's weird

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,600
I don't know if there's a car here

83
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,360
You have a car

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
You don't have a car

85
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,320
Then you drive

86
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,480
No

87
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,160
Then we

88
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,960
Then we drive

89
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,840
Don't care about it

90
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Don't be so busy

91
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,880
You just talk to him

92
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,320
You don't understand

93
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,680
You talk slowly, I don't understand

94
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,440
Who can understand

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,000
Talk to him

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,960
What

97
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,360
Anyway, you are here

98
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
You are here to talk to me

99
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,440
I'm here to drive over

100
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,560
You drive over, right

101
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
His car takes us there

102
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,280
You drive over

103
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,480
Take us over

104
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,240
What

105
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,320
Take us over

106
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,800
He took our car

107
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,440
The car is here

108
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,360
This car

109
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,480
Really

110
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,980
I told you

111
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,640
You're specially built

112
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,760
It's really cool

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,600
Family

114
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,440
Go to him after you're done

115
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,720
Thank you

116
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
Really

117
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,040
You two can go first

118
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,520
Then we two sit in the middle

119
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Two people sit behind

120
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,320
Just six people

121
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,240
Brother Lin, we two sit behind

122
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
OK

123
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,680
OK?

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
It seems OK

125
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,600
OK

126
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:05,960
Come on

127
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,480
Jiang Linhe, you don't have to serve

128
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,120
You come down

129
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,120
Sit well?

130
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,840
Sit well

131
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,040
Let's go

132
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,360
I feel like he can't run

133
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,480
Can you push back?

134
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,880
Do you want to feel the push back?

135
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,200
Don't

136
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,440
He is holding on well

137
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,720
Really a lot of push back

138
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
When I came, I was fine

139
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
I can't go back

140
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,960
You should think about it now

141
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,480
How to tell the boss later

142
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,880
It's still you

143
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,760
You say it

144
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
Why don't you let me say it?

145
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,760
Why don't you let me say it?

146
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,240
You have to be responsible for this

147
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,600
Are you a singer like this?

148
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm a singer like this

149
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,040
You have to

150
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
You have to represent us to help

151
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,400
Tell the boss, OK?

152
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,640
It doesn't matter

153
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,080
It doesn't matter if you say it

154
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,520
The important thing is that we are back

155
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,080
OK

156
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
OK

157
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
Erniu, I'm leaving

158
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,160
I'm going to school in the city

159
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,200
Wait for me

160
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,440
Yanzi

161
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,080
How can I live without you?

162
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,120
Yanzi, how can I live without you?

163
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
There is one more thing we haven't done

164
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,440
What?

165
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,760
The fish hasn't been caught yet

166
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,640
Yes

167
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,680
Pickled fish

168
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,640
OK

169
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,120
Sit well

170
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,440
Let's go

171
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,040
Go down

172
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Go

173
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,360
Come back

174
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,960
Who is playing the swing here?

175
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Who is playing the swing here?

176
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,080
Hello

177
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,040
Hello

178
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,480
You are the three-part crew

179
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
to come here to meet the team, right?

180
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,520
Yes

181
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,880
I've been waiting for you for a long time

182
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,840
Welcome

183
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,760
We have been here

184
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,600
Have you been here before?

185
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,120
I haven't received you

186
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,160
No

187
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,800
Let me introduce myself

188
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,840
I'm the manager here

189
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Just call me Piggy

190
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
Let me introduce you to our team

191
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Look, we have these employees here

192
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,840
There are three cats and three dogs

193
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,560
One cow and one chicken

194
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,280
Little cow

195
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,000
Little gray and little colorful

196
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,200
No

197
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,800
Wait a minute, their names have changed

198
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,520
The names of these animals have changed

199
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,080
I know this cow

200
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,360
It was called MoMo

201
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
The grass has turned black

202
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,720
Do you have a male boss here?

203
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm the manager of this manor

204
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,600
My surname is Lin

205
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,640
You can call me Lin

206
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,400
OK, Brother Lin

207
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,240
Do you have a male boss here?

208
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,640
No, just me

209
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,040
Do you know this key?

210
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,720
You are going to buy vegetables, right?

211
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,840
You drive this car

212
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
I don't know

213
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,640
He's a newbie

214
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,480
The first day of the push-in

215
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm the manager of this manor

216
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,800
My surname is Lin

217
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,040
You can call me Lin

218
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm the manager here

219
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Just call me Piggy

220
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
You brought the vegetables yourself, right?

221
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,800
Yes

222
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,760
Let me take you there

223
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,400
Thank you

224
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,840
Go

225
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,920
No

226
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,560
Why do you come again?

227
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,720
The kitchen is inside

228
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,320
We know

229
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,960
You know

230
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,440
Yes

231
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
Have you been here before?

232
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,680
We have been here

233
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,080
I have no impression of you

234
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,840
I was not the female boss at that time

235
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,240
but another man

236
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,920
The boss

237
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,400
Yes

238
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,160
But I have been here for years

239
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
Are you here during the day?

240
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,640
I have been waiting for you on the swing during the day

241
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Come on, everyone, this way

242
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,400
This is the kitchen

243
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,000
So just now we started from the moment of buying vegetables

244
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,240
We entered the cycle

245
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,480
Let's change it all

246
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
The boss has changed too

247
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,160
We have changed to another world

248
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
But you need to find me again

249
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,880
I have something urgent to do

250
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,800
I'll go ahead

251
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,600
OK

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,680
Bye

253
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,800
OK, bye

254
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
OK, let's start cooking

255
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Let's start cooking

256
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,080
There is a

257
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't want to go

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,320
How to get through this?

259
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,600
You don't want one?

260
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,160
You come here

261
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,000
Come on, the trainee is here

262
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,280
Wait a minute, let's untie this first

263
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,160
Wait a minute, you ask me if I want it

264
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,840
You ask me if I want it

265
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,120
Do you want it, Jingjing?

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,080
I'm not convenient

267
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,160
You are not convenient, let me do it

268
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,120
Is it okay?

269
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,080
You have to do this

270
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,960
Thank you, Lin He

271
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,800
Where is your waist?

272
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,720
Where is my waist?

273
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,040
What are you?

274
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,800
Are you a fish?

275
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Yes

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
I just need to fry the potatoes with sour sauce

277
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,760
You have to cut it

278
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
You don't have to wash it, you don't have to cut it

279
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,240
Then you cut the ingredients well

280
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,800
Yes, I cut the ingredients well first

281
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,920
Then you cut my ingredients by the way

282
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Anyway, they are all silk

283
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,760
What about my fish, friends?

284
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,960
Take you to fishing

285
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,600
Who can help me?

286
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Piggy

287
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Hello

288
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,960
We want to fish

289
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,760
Fishing

290
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,160
Yes

291
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,520
We can fish in this pond

292
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,840
OK, let's go fishing together

293
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,400
Let's go

294
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,160
OK

295
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,000
Go

296
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
Let's go this way

297
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,400
OK

298
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,040
We will walk a mountain road

299
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,760
Everyone, pay attention to your feet later

300
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,640
Walk the mountain road

301
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,960
We will get there

302
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,760
Why is there such a big smoke in your mountain villa?

303
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,840
There is such a big smoke

304
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,360
I think something scary will fall

305
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,280
Don't scare me

306
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
How can it be?

307
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,320
Maybe because the fog came down at night

308
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,040
OK

309
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,200
Have you ever had any strange things here?

310
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,840
No

311
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,760
Do you suddenly feel that your brain is not good

312
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
and then your memory disappears?

313
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,680
No

314
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,360
Do you feel that sometimes you feel that you are a man?

315
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,480
I am a man

316
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,280
Yes

317
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,040
No

318
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,280
Everyone walks down along the road

319
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,120
We are at the place where we fish

320
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,320
Go down from here

321
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,120
I have prepared the fishing rods for you

322
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,800
OK

323
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,560
I will fall down

324
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,080
Enough

325
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,960
It's at the bottom

326
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
You take the line

327
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,560
Let me sit with my sister Jin

328
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,320
Sit down

329
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,440
How can I get in?

330
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,400
How did you get here?

331
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,240
Teach me

332
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,400
Throw it into the net

333
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,560
What do you mean?

334
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,080
Just let the fish come first

335
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,960
Eat a little first

336
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,680
Here you go

337
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,960
Throw it into the net

338
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,600
I forbid you to play the fool again

339
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
I really can't

340
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,280
How can I do that?

341
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,480
How can I do that?

342
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,400
Throw it a little farther

343
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,360
Don't get too close

344
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,320
I can't do it

345
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,040
I can't do it

346
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,760
I can't do it

347
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,840
I can't do it

348
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I can't do it

349
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,720
I can't do it

350
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,760
I can't do it

351
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,720
I can't do it

352
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,680
I can't do it

353
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,520
I can't do it

354
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,560
All right

355
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,040
It's all right

356
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,920
give it all

357
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't feed it

358
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,120
Slow down

359
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,520
You hook into my net

360
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,400
I can't see it clearly

361
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,320
You can't reach it

362
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,240
How can it be enough

363
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,400
You put the rod back first

364
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,520
It can't be released

365
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,960
No, you pull it back

366
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
It's stuck

367
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,320
Pull it back

368
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,120
Be careful, the hook is sharp

369
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,480
Where is the hook?

370
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,120
The green one is all hooks

371
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,040
Below this, right?

372
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,600
Two small hooks

373
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,200
There is a shadow of autumn here

374
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,120
Really?

375
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,480
There is a shadow of autumn

376
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
What's that?

377
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,480
What's that?

378
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
Did you bump your feet?

379
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,120
What's that?

380
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,840
It's a shadow of autumn

381
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,960
What's the shadow of autumn?

382
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,920
Give it to me

383
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,960
Give it to me

384
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,160
It's okay

385
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,200
Is it alive?

386
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,560
Alive

387
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,720
I was so scared to catch it

388
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,800
I'm really scared now

389
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,600
No, the whole shadow of autumn hook

390
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,800
The whole hook

391
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,160
Two hooks, one for that one

392
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,000
The other one for that one

393
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,360
Two hooks, one for that one

394
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,480
The other one for corn

395
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,360
Mixed with sweet and sour sauce

396
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,520
Do we need to measure it?

397
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,720
How to fish

398
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,960
Just put some meat in it

399
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,920
It will come up

400
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,680
That's it?

401
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,200
Yes

402
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,400
Like a dish

403
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,160
What does it feel like?

404
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,520
Really?

405
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,760
Why don't I believe it?

406
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,080
Old iron door

407
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,120
Let's go

408
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,160
Come on

409
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,920
Come on, let's start

410
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,960
Don't you have ears?

411
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,760
Then these

412
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,200
What's that sound?

413
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
The chair

414
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,880
Is it broken?

415
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,560
It's broken

416
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,760
It's okay, I'll squat down

417
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,920
Squat down and drink it

418
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,320
Come on, I'll get it for you

419
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,280
I'll get it for you

420
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,920
I'll get it for you

421
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,120
You're making it too troublesome

422
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,800
Okay, your stool

423
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,440
I don't understand

424
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,400
It's not a hook

425
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,600
It's a circle

426
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
You take it, let me see

427
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,200
Look

428
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,240
Why isn't it a hook?

429
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,760
Isn't it a hook?

430
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,320
Be careful

431
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,880
It's all hooks down here

432
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,800
Hang this first

433
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,400
The hook is very sharp

434
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,760
Be careful, be careful of the hook

435
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,000
Okay, you take one and hang it up

436
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,720
Be careful when hanging

437
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,240
This is on the hook

438
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,080
This is on the hook

439
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,120
It eats corn

440
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Eat corn

441
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
A little further

442
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,600
Is this the pole?

443
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
Don't throw it

444
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,400
Then why is it a little further?

445
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,080
Get away from the mirror first

446
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,920
Help me to put the pole up first

447
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,640
Put the pole first

448
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,840
Wait a minute, I'll put it out

449
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,440
Straight forward like this

450
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,320
Awesome

451
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
Straight forward like this, right?

452
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,960
Yes

453
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,360
Yes

454
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,240
Okay, wait

455
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait

456
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,960
Is this ball shadow a little big?

457
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,800
It's okay

458
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,840
It will come when it smells

459
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,340
Go

460
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Is there really fish?

461
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,760
I don't think there kind of fish

462
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,760
I have fish

463
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,260
There is net here

464
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:32,740
This is a

465
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,660
Was it transfers for you here?

466
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,820
There are no transfers

467
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,740
It can't be

468
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,460
Why?

469
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,460
What's that?

470
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
What?

471
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
King of Fish

472
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,460
There must be fish in the King of Fish

473
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
Be careful

474
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,460
Be careful

475
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Not only fish

476
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,460
There must be one inside

477
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Not the boss in the daytime

478
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
Come on, guys

479
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
Come on

480
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
So long

481
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
There are fish

482
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,460
Be careful

483
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Don't slide down

484
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
I'll help you turn around

485
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,460
Turn around

486
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
I'll help you

487
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
So heavy

488
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,460
There is a box

489
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
OK

490
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
Be careful

491
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,460
I'll help you

492
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
Come on, hold on

493
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
It's a box

494
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,460
Why is there a box here?

495
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,460
I don't understand

496
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,460
Open it

497
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
Open it

498
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
What's this?

499
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
It's a human

500
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,460
Is it a human bone?

501
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
Is it a human head?

502
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
It's wet

503
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,460
Head

504
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
Yes, there is a white monkey inside

505
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,460
Is it a white monkey?

506
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
What should I do?

507
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,460
What else is there?

508
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Stone

509
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
Stone used to make incense

510
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
What does it mean?

511
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
It's wet

512
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
It's wet

513
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
Then it's sunk into the bottom of the sea

514
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Take the stone

515
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Not the boss in the daytime

516
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,460
This doesn't look like an adult's body

517
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
This is a child's toy

518
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,460
Yes

519
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
Because only children can go to the luggage box

520
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
So is this hair?

521
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
This should be hair

522
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,460
Hair

523
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,460
If this hair is so long

524
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,460
It must be a woman

525
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,460
Then it's a little girl

526
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,460
Yes

527
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,460
There are only bones

528
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,460
It's been put for a long time

529
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,460
Piggy

530
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
Piggy

531
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
Have you killed anyone here?

532
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
What?

533
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,460
What's wrong?

534
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
Look at it yourself

535
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
What's this?

536
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,460
What's this?

537
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
That's a human bone

538
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
Who put this net?

539
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
After the last tourist

540
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,460
After leaving, it was always put here

541
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,460
How long was it last time?

542
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
It was about a week ago

543
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
That's impossible

544
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
The box has been here for many years

545
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
No

546
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Did you get it out of this?

547
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Yes

548
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
No, this must not be in our manor

549
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
This has nothing to do with us

550
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
It must be flown back from somewhere else

551
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
It was with the fish net

552
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Yes

553
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
I remember

554
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,460
You say

555
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,460
I remember

556
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Recently, we are not peaceful here

557
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,460
I don't know when it started

558
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
This kind of big fog will arise

559
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,460
They said this fog is an unbearable sign

560
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
It seems that something is hidden in this house

561
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
The people who entered the house

562
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Some didn't come out

563
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Then the ones who came out became

564
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
Became crazy

565
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,460
I don't know when it started

566
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Big fog

567
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
It seems that something is hidden in this house

568
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
The people who entered the house

569
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
Some didn't come out

570
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Then the ones who came out became

571
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Became crazy

572
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,460
This body must be related to this big fog

573
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
What should I do?

574
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,460
I have to tell the above

575
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Let them deal with it

576
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,460
I'm sorry to disturb your team building

577
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
Can you pay off this time?

578
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
I can't pay off this time

579
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
I can't pay off this time

580
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
Can you pay off this time?

581
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Let's talk about this when we go back

582
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Everything is easy to say

583
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
All are abnormal people

584
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Did you catch fish?

585
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
There are

586
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
Who dares to eat this fish?

587
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
I have to cook here

588
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
Do you want to eat this fish?

589
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
It's all soaked with the wet

590
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
Who eats this fish?

591
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
It's okay, this fish can be eaten

592
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
More humanly

593
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
More humanly

594
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,460
I'll stay here and deal with it

595
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,460
I'll report it

596
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
Then you deal with it

597
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Don't tell others

598
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,460
Otherwise, I can't do this business

599
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Okay

600
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
Come back and cook

601
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Come back and cook

602
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,460
It reminds me of a movie called Ji Jingling

603
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Wait a minute, let's analyze it a little bit

604
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,460
Wait a minute, let's analyze it a little bit

605
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Is it alive?

606
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Yes

607
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
No

608
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
I think so

609
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
He put the stone

610
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,460
He should be a

611
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,460
A little girl in a box

612
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,460
He took this doll and sank together

613
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
Then he died

614
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
No one knew that he was broken into a skeleton

615
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Just such a thing

616
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
Yes

617
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
There was also fog when we bought vegetables

618
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,460
Why is there such a big smoke?

619
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,460
Because the vegetable market is a time-space transition point

620
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
Yes

621
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
The director just said

622
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,460
Recently, it's strange that people will get fog

623
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
Then some people can't come back to the fog

624
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
Or it will be crazy after they come back

625
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Yes

626
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
So our car went into the fog

627
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
The car is gone

628
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
Yes

629
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
Is this fog a possible

630
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,460
A medium that can travel through the parallel world

631
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
Yes, it may be

632
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,460
I'm also afraid to onion

633
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
I want to eat

634
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
Then it's open

635
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,460
I want to eat

636
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Then find someone to help

637
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
Peel three vinegar

638
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Then turn on the lights

639
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
Cook

640
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
OK?

641
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Come on

642
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,460
Season ingredients first

643
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,080
OK

644
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm eating this

645
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,940
Don't say anything

646
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Brothers

647
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,460
You really know

648
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,260
I don't know

649
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,420
When was the last time you cooked

650
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,860
About a year

651
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,780
You are the one who is in turn

652
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,980
Emotional value is here

653
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,740
Of course

654
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,020
I'm taking care of you, right

655
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,540
You're jealous

656
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,020
I tell you

657
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,860
I choose this one

658
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,100
You're so annoying

659
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,660
So amazing

660
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,180
of the taste

661
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,380
It has been so long

662
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,300
You can لoso

663
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,020
Please

664
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,100
Qian Hua

665
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,060
You're ready

666
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,900
To get a head start

667
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,660
No

668
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,700
No

669
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,420
One more

670
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,660
So ugly

671
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,240
Please

672
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,900
oops

673
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:58,940
no

674
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,140
Yes

675
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,960
I too

676
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,680
Is this

677
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,760
's not

678
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,200
My brother

679
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,160
What's this

680
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,940
Disney cut

681
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,240
Why did you do this

682
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,900
allas

683
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,380
what happened

684
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,280
like us

685
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,120
Why did you do this

686
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,100
Can you eat it this way

687
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,720
Can't I eat this

688
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Today I ate sour jelly

689
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,880
Come on, brother

690
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,660
can I give you a formula

691
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,700
Wait, you can't cut it like this

692
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,200
can you teach us

693
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,100
You like to cut it longer

694
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,240
like this

695
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,800
And then?

696
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,480
The husband is the husband, Liu Yuning.

697
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,640
Yuning, you are really good.

698
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
At least, I'm a little speechless.

699
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,960
Bai Yu, Bai Yu, you are speechless.

700
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,040
Reba, Reba, you are not bad.

701
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,400
Okay.

702
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,640
You should do this.

703
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,320
Just...

704
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's compare.

705
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,960
There is a bottom here.

706
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,360
And then?

707
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,600
Okay, I'll imitate you.

708
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,840
Isn't this long?

709
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,800
I'll imitate him.

710
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,920
You are so smart.

711
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,320
Don't say that.

712
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,600
You really know it as soon as you learn it.

713
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,000
You have made a great progress.

714
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,200
You are a little good.

715
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,320
You have already become a mouth-picking.

716
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,240
This one is really awesome.

717
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,560
Wait a minute.

718
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,720
Look at my brother.

719
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,920
He has been watching for two minutes.

720
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
Before talking to Liu Yuning,

721
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,280
after talking to Liu Yuning.

722
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,640
You are really good.

723
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,240
I'm good.

724
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,480
Smart.

725
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,000
Perfect.

726
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,440
What's the matter?

727
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,560
Put the pot in cold water.

728
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,600
He drank some hot soup.

729
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:06,160
There won't be any problem in the room.

730
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,400
This is a platter of Dreams.

731
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,480
Why so many dreams?

732
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,840
Why so many dreams!

733
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,280
Why?

734
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
I can't cut it like this

735
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
This can't be so high

736
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Yes, I found it

737
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I cut it for you

738
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
I cut it

739
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Still brother

740
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Brother, what do you mainly put in this?

741
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Put some raw meat

742
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Just put some salt

743
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Then put some heart

744
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Brother, this shallot tofu

745
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Also need seasoning

746
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Just mix it directly

747
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Just salt and MSG

748
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
You want garlic too

749
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
Garlic, you want it too

750
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Put some salt

751
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Just in case

752
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Why is there chicken in this?

753
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
What?

754
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Soaked

755
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Why is this soaked?

756
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Because it needs

757
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Soaked with cooking wine

758
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
Or soak it after cutting

759
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
No need to cut

760
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Do you need to cut the chicken?

761
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
OK

762
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Hot pot base

763
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Brother Ning

764
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Do you know how to fry sweet and sour pork?

765
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
I tell you, you don't have to make it so complicated

766
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Just melt it with water

767
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Then you can cook the sweet and sour pork

768
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Then put some salt in it

769
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Then put some salt in it

770
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Then add some water

771
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
OK

772
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Wait

773
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Brother Ning

774
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Can you make a fire fish?

775
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
I can

776
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
It's OK, let me do it

777
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Come on

778
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Awesome, you really know how to do it

779
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Are you killing fish?

780
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Finished

781
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
How can you be so good?

782
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Cooking wine

783
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
OK

784
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
What about the next step?

785
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Next, Zhang Linghe can do it

786
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
You can add some water

787
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Just cook it for a while

788
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Add some water and you can make that kind of soup

789
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
OK

790
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
You need to add water first, right?

791
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Yes, I can

792
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
I'm afraid it will be too soft

793
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
So I add some water

794
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Then you can fry it before

795
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
You can use hot water to heat it

796
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Like this

797
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Awesome

798
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
We wear this suit and shirt today

799
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
And cook here

800
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,280
Wearing a suit and shirt and cooking here

801
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,280
The next day

802
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
You are still the same

803
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
I can't stand you

804
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Why are you in there?

805
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Little cat.

806
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Whose voice is that?

807
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
It's a bit mute.

808
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
You...

809
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
You can do it.

810
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
You have to show off.

811
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
You can cook.

812
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
A little.

813
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Some simple things.

814
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
I can't eat a bowl of rice every day.

815
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Your beef is also like a model.

816
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
Just follow his recipe, right?

817
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Yes.

818
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Pepper.

819
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Chopped pepper sauce.

820
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,280
So much.

821
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Spicy.

822
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
I'm drooling.

823
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
This is absolutely delicious.

824
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,280
This soup is really suitable for eating rice.

825
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Yes, it's perfect for rice.

826
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
This dish is for free.

827
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
This dish is for free.

828
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Give me a knife.

829
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
It smells so good.

830
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
You just put it in the pot.

831
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Don't put anything in it.

832
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Yes, that's it.

833
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Put it in the pot.

834
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Come on.

835
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
A bowl of rice.

836
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
Brother, you put some rice in it.

837
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
It looks so delicious.

838
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
It's so delicious.

839
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Okay.

840
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
It looks good.

841
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
It's absolutely delicious.

842
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
It's absolutely delicious.

843
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
This is absolutely delicious.

844
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Let's live alone.

845
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Live alone.

846
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Live alone.

847
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Try this fish.

848
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
It's really good.

849
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
This fish is really delicious.

850
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
It's good.

851
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
It's delicious.

852
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Come on.

853
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Try this double-chopped beef.

854
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
This is delicious.

855
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
It's perfect for rice.

856
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
It's good.

857
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
It's not a beef.

858
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
It's not necessary.

859
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
It's really delicious.

860
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
It's good.

861
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
It's good.

862
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
The chicken soup is so fresh.

863
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
The chicken soup is delicious.

864
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
There are chickens.

865
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Who wants to eat?

866
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
This chicken is delicious.

867
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
This chicken looks so good.

868
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
It's great.

869
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
I'll try your spicy and sour potato chips.

870
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
It's delicious.

871
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Really?

872
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
It's good.

873
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
It's really good.

874
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
It's really good.

875
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
It's really good.

876
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
The potato chips are not soft.

877
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Yes.

878
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
Spicy and sour potato chips are really good.

879
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
The taste is good.

880
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
It's really delicious.

881
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
I think every dish is good for rice.

882
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Yes.

883
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Right?

884
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
Your cold water salad is good.

885
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,280
Is it possible that we are really hungry?

886
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Why is everything delicious?

887
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
I think so.

888
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
We are all really good.

889
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Everyone must think that

890
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
we are complementing each other.

891
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
That kind of mutual support.

892
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Yes.

893
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Commercial mutual support.

894
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
I'm sitting in front of him.

895
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
It's delicious.

896
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
This chicken is so delicious.

897
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
If the actors don't work anymore,

898
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
we can open a restaurant together.

899
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Okay.

900
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
It's really good.

901
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
We will definitely lose.

902
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
We will tie the apron

903
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
to each other.

904
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
We will wear an apron

905
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
and stand in front of each other.

906
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Tie the apron.

907
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
We will give them steak.

908
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
This restaurant must be very popular.

909
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Let's collect money.

910
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Great.

911
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Okay.

912
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
If we shoot together,

913
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
it must be called Helimo.

914
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Golden fish.

915
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Your stop is very good.

916
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Helimo.

917
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
It's the four of us

918
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
who are holding the fire and the steak.

919
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
It's called Helimo.

920
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Okay.

921
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Next, there is a team building task.

922
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Complete.

923
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Close the fireworks immediately.

924
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Guess my brother.

925
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Everyone wears headphones.

926
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
The first person will play a melody in the headphones.

927
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
He needs to use his own face to play the song.

928
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
The second person will guess the melody.

929
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
The first person will play the song.

930
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
The last person will guess the melody.

931
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
He will give me

932
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
the right melody

933
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
but the wrong lyrics.

934
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Yes.

935
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Guess the song according to the melody.

936
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Come on.

937
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
It's really good.

938
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Let me be the first one.

939
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
This is very important.

940
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Don't worry.

941
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
I'm so tired.

942
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
I'm so tired.

943
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm so tired.

944
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
I'm so tired.

945
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,280
I'm so tired.

946
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
I'm so tired.

947
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
I'm so tired.

948
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
I'm so tired.

949
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
I'm so tired.

950
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
I'm so tired.

951
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
I'm so tired.

952
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm so tired.

953
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
I'm so tired.

954
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
I'm so tired.

955
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
I'm so tired.

956
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
I'm so tired.

957
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
I'm so tired.

958
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
I'm so tired.

959
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
I'm so tired.

960
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
I'm so tired.

961
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
I'm so tired.

962
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
I'm so tired.

963
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm so tired.

964
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
I'm so tired.

965
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
I'm so tired.

966
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
I'm so tired.

967
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
I'm so tired.

968
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm so tired.

969
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
I'm so tired.

970
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
OK, let's do it.

971
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
OK.

972
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
This one is very important.

973
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Don't worry.

974
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
In that mountain,

975
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
that sea,

976
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
they come to the forest again.

977
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
In that mountain, that sea,

978
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
they come to the forest again.

979
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,640
They are lively and smart

980
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,640
Isn't this Blue Spirit?

981
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,480
They are naughty and smart

982
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,040
This is Blue Spirit

983
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,240
Do it again

984
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,840
I don't know any song of this song

985
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,400
Do it again, it's okay

986
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,040
It's so difficult

987
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,840
What should I do?

988
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,680
What are you doing?

989
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,320
Listen to its melody

990
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,000
I just listen to the melody

991
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,840
Slow down, you can slow down

992
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,440
OK

993
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,600
What are you doing?

994
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,280
Your shading is so bad

995
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,520
She just tried to create a 부 gagnant

996
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,120
Thanks

997
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,000
She's right

998
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,200
very difficult

999
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,760
You should try again

1000
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,480
Again

1001
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,440
So hard

1002
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,200
Sing it

1003
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Can I try again

1004
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,680
Sing it

1005
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,240
That's my line

1006
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,940
Tutorial

1007
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
They are lively and smart

1008
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
They are lively and smart

1009
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Dear

1010
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Where is the sea

1011
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Dear, I fell in love with you

1012
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
From that day

1013
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
It's easy to be sweet

1014
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
It's easy to be sweet

1015
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
It's easy to be sweet

1016
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
It's easy to be sweet

1017
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
It's easy to be sweet

1018
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
It's easy to be sweet

1019
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Why do you sing so differently every time

1020
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
This song is my favorite

1021
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
I don't know what song it is

1022
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
There is a group of girls

1023
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
There is a group of girls

1024
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Dear, I fell in love with you

1025
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
They are lively and smart

1026
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
They are lively and smart

1027
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Help me

1028
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
No, the main thing is who comes to change me

1029
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
Change me, I'm the first one

1030
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Change

1031
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Brother Ning, you do the last one

1032
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
I think I can't play the last one

1033
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
No, because Lin He doesn't move

1034
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
It's useless

1035
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
Unless you get Lin He out

1036
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Then you sit in the middle

1037
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Are you the first one?

1038
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
Then you come first

1039
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Wait

1040
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
If someone can sing this song

1041
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
Then I lose

1042
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,780
I get it

1043
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,780
Flying over mountains

1044
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,780
Flying over mountains

1045
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,780
There is a group of girls

1046
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
There is a group of girls

1047
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,780
sąhh

1048
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,020
Wait until me. Let me sing from the beginning

1049
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,020
don't worry

1050
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
Flying over mountains

1051
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,220
Flying over mountains

1052
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,220
There is a group of girls

1053
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,220
There is a group of girls

1054
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,220
They are lively and smart

1055
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,500
I know

1056
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,740
Absolutely right

1057
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,140
You're not a good singer

1058
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,940
It's not easy for me to understand

1059
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,700
I mean

1060
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,420
Because you are

1061
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,700
It's possible that I got it wrong

1062
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,900
Listen to me

1063
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,940
I'll sing it, right?

1064
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,900
You are my little duck

1065
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,540
Little duck, little apple

1066
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,700
Little duck, little apple

1067
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,380
Just like the most beautiful thing in the world

1068
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,980
They are naughty and have spirit

1069
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,340
In the mountains, in the sea

1070
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,660
In the blue sky

1071
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,620
You are my little duck

1072
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,180
Little duck, little apple

1073
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,540
Do you get it?

1074
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,140
You are always too soft

1075
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,980
Too soft

1076
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,740
Alone

1077
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,380
Tear to dawn

1078
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,220
Yes, cut

1079
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,020
Then I lose

1080
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,180
You can't cut it anywhere

1081
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,860
So fast

1082
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,220
So fast

1083
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,900
You are always too soft

1084
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,700
Too soft

1085
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,460
Alone

1086
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,980
Tear to dawn

1087
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,700
Yes, cut

1088
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,820
Then I lose

1089
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,460
You can't cut it anywhere

1090
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,700
So fast

1091
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,580
You can't cut it anywhere

1092
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,260
Tear to dawn

1093
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,820
Yes, cut

1094
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,700
Then I lose

1095
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,580
You can't cut it anywhere

1096
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,580
So fast

1097
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,580
One more time

1098
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,460
You are always too soft

1099
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,060
Too soft

1100
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,420
I want to send you the yearning that never goes down

1101
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,100
The name of love

1102
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,380
The name of love

1103
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:10,100
The name of love

1104
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,740
Enough

1105
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,220
OK?

1106
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:11,900
OK

1107
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,140
He lost about 70%

1108
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,620
OK

1109
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,020
The name of love

1110
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,220
OK

1111
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,500
OK

1112
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:22,940
Come on

1113
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:33,940
I want to send you the yearning that never goes down

1114
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:39,460
The name of love

1115
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,100
Awesome

1116
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,580
This is awesome

1117
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,380
OK

1118
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,620
OK

1119
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,700
The name of love

1120
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,660
The name of love

1121
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,860
The name of love

1122
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,660
The name of love

1123
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,460
Follow me

1124
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,020
Good night

1125
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,260
Wait

1126
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,260
Wait

1127
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,900
Follow me

1128
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,260
Left hand, right hand, slow

1129
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,820
Slow motion

1130
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,580
Right hand, left hand, slow motion

1131
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,460
Start over

1132
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,180
Start over

1133
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,020
It's over

1134
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,620
It's over

1135
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,900
It's all gone

1136
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,140
I really want to sing this song

1137
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,260
Wait

1138
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,460
What's this?

1139
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,260
Right hand, left hand, right hand

1140
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,180
Slow motion

1141
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,620
Right hand, left hand, slow motion

1142
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,620
Start over

1143
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,140
Slow motion

1144
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,380
Start over

1145
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,260
Is this a famous song?

1146
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,380
Yes

1147
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,420
Is it a famous song?

1148
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:17,940
Yes

1149
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:23,020
Start over

1150
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,540
Yes

1151
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,100
Yes

1152
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,540
It's over

1153
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,700
The wave is coming back

1154
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,820
Start over

1155
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,540
So good

1156
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,060
The wave is coming back

1157
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,740
Start over

1158
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,460
Alexander bread house

1159
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,380
The wave is coming back

1160
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,540
The first time

1161
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,820
Did you sing it for me?

1162
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,060
There is a blue sky on the grass on the hill

1163
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,260
There is a blue sky

1164
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,380
There is a blue sky

1165
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,980
Did you sing the original song?

1166
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,260
The original song is blue sky

1167
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,980
I thought it was a mountain

1168
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,860
The grass is open

1169
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,380
I thought I was singing this

1170
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,420
Really?

1171
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,620
I feel like I sang it right

1172
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,820
Let me try

1173
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,620
You press this

1174
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,700
The blue sky on the hill

1175
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,380
The blue sky on the sea

1176
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,900
They are lively and smart

1177
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,620
They are naughty and clever

1178
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,540
Right?

1179
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,260
Yes

1180
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,740
I can't get the pitch

1181
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,020
His pitch is that

1182
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,820
You can't catch his pitch

1183
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,140
You can't guess his next song

1184
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,940
You can't guess his next song

1185
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,740
What does he have?

1186
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,860
After wearing this headset

1187
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,300
It will affect his singing

1188
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,460
It's not accurate

1189
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,460
You can't guess his next song

1190
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,180
Congratulations on completing the challenge

1191
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,740
Now you can enjoy fireworks outside

1192
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,300
Go out and watch fireworks

1193
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,860
Go

1194
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,380
I put it here myself

1195
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,460
I haven't put fireworks for a long time

1196
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,420
I want to play this

1197
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
The firework

1198
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,260
You have to take two

1199
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,500
Dance and dance

1200
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,220
That feeling

1201
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:10,580
Here it comes

1202
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,500
Nice

1203
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,420
That one

1204
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,940
This one is fun

1205
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,980
This one is so beautiful

1206
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,300
So romantic

1207
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,340
A little starlight

1208
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,660
This one is so beautiful

1209
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,980
Even if you have to control it

1210
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,980
You still can't forget it

1211
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,340
So pretty

1212
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,140
Very nice

1213
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,420
This is so beautiful

1214
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,740
So beautiful

1215
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,540
This is a little cool

1216
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,980
This is really cool

1217
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,660
very cool

1218
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,540
Three, two, one

1219
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,420
Light up

1220
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,700
Ready to jump

1221
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,260
Wait a minute

1222
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,940
Wait a minute

1223
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,220
Light up

1224
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,420
It's so cool

1225
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,020
Look

1226
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,380
Screw you

1227
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:04,860
This is very cool

1228
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,260
It is cool

1229
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,780
tests the Go Pro

1230
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,220
Special poppies!

1231
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,740
Fantastic!

1232
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,380
My innovative magic...

1233
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,620
The third season...

1234
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,960
Here it is!

1235
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,420
Go.

1236
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,180
Look.

1237
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,140
There's someone.

1238
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,140
It's so scary.

1239
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,820
There's someone.

1240
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,900
Catch him.

1241
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,380
Hurry up.

1242
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,060
Brother Bai, go.

1243
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,780
Hurry up.

1244
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,620
Go and catch him.

1245
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,420
Hurry up.

1246
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,300
Be careful.

1247
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,140
There's a flower bed here.

1248
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,780
Go and catch him.

1249
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,700
Hurry up.

1250
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,380
Hurry up.

1251
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,100
Did you catch him?

1252
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,740
No.

1253
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,340
It's a pity.

1254
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,740
It's a pity.

1255
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,540
It's a pity.

1256
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,460
It's a pity.

1257
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,140
You're old.

1258
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,700
OK.

1259
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,620
Your knife is slow.

1260
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,740
OK, my knife is slow.

1261
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,380
It's time for me to reflect on myself.

1262
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,460
So next time,

1263
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,660
I will definitely

1264
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,820
not let him

1265
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,460
escape from my eyes.

1266
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,460
What's that?

1267
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,140
There's an eye.

1268
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,260
What's that?

1269
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,100
The eye is moving.

1270
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,860
The eye.

1271
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,340
What does it mean?

1272
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,940
I'm TYJ.

1273
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,740
You can call me推眼睛.

1274
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,460
推眼睛.

1275
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,140
推眼睛.

1276
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,740
推眼睛.

1277
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,540
推眼睛.

1278
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,380
推眼睛.

1279
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,380
Time is running out.

1280
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,180
You have to complete the task as soon as possible.

1281
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,940
What task?

1282
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,500
What?

1283
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,460
What?

1284
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,540
What task?

1285
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,580
What's wrong?

1286
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,340
What's wrong?

1287
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,340
That one.

1288
00:48:59,340 --> 00:48:59,780
That one.

1289
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,580
Something flew over.

1290
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,660
What?

1291
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,580
A drone flew over.

1292
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,740
Something fell on the ground.

1293
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,580
What does it say?

1294
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,500
What's that?

1295
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,660
推眼睛.

1296
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,660
推眼睛.

1297
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,260
Time is running out.

1298
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,340
Be careful.

1299
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,260
It should fall over there.

1300
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,620
Time is running out.

1301
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,700
From the start of the flight,

1302
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,260
your task has begun.

1303
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,020
All the accidents that happened today

1304
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,300
are related to your task.

1305
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,060
I always feel that

1306
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,580
there are many things hidden in this place.

1307
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,780
The dog's name has changed.

1308
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,820
And the boss's name has changed.

1309
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,140
I'm the manager of this manor.

1310
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,700
My surname is Lin.

1311
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,700
You can call me Lin.

1312
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,620
Okay, Brother Lin.

1313
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,740
I'm the manager here.

1314
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,020
You can call me Zhu.

1315
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,100
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

1316
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:56,900
Welcome.

1317
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,980
We've been here.

1318
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,740
And our car was lost.

1319
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,100
The car is gone.

1320
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,140
Where's the car?

1321
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,300
Where's our car?

1322
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,220
Where's our car?

1323
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,860
When we got off the car,

1324
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,180
the phone kept moving.

1325
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,620
It cut itself.

1326
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,900
It's like someone is controlling it.

1327
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,580
Why is the phone moving by itself?

1328
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,340
Brother.

1329
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:14,980
It's controlled.

1330
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,780
Someone is using it.

1331
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,900
Someone is filming.

1332
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,140
Yes, and there's smoke.

1333
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,260
It's mainly that fog.

1334
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,260
Recently, we're not very peaceful here.

1335
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,340
I don't know when it started.

1336
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,780
It's a big fog.

1337
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,260
And that body.

1338
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,020
What is it?

1339
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,900
We don't know yet.

1340
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,380
The body in the box.

1341
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,340
You know, there's a doll in it.

1342
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,300
There's a clue in this box.

1343
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,300
Let's start to guess.

1344
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,380
Take a look, brother.

1345
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,500
Take a look.

1346
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,580
Take a look.

1347
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,780
What's this?

1348
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,340
Death notice.

1349
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,660
Old Mu.

1350
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,300
It's that man.

1351
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,300
That man.

1352
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,700
Old Mu and...

1353
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,100
What?

1354
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,340
He died.

1355
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,700
All the dates were blocked.

1356
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,860
Is it a cat paw?

1357
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,340
Is it a dog paw?

1358
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,820
What does it mean?

1359
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,540
All the dates were blocked.

1360
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,740
It means that the cat is dead.

1361
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,940
It means that the dog is dead.

1362
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,940
It means that the dog is dead.

1363
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,940
It means that the dog is dead.

1364
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,620
All the dates were blocked.

1365
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,740
Is it a cat paw?

1366
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,340
It means that

1367
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,620
the cat in his hand

1368
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,020
was at the crime scene.

1369
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:43,660
So his blood

1370
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,700
was on the paw and then went there.

1371
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,940
Are we going to find this cat today?

1372
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,220
Yes.

1373
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,060
Is it a milk cat?

1374
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,020
Where is the cat paw leading us?

1375
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,900
It's over there.

1376
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,060
There is a cat paw in this.

1377
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,300
Let's go.

1378
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,260
Cat paw.

1379
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,260
Cat paw.

1380
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,940
Cat paw.

1381
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,740
Is it this?

1382
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,140
Is it a cat?

1383
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,340
Is there anything in here?

1384
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,220
Is there anything?

1385
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,220
No.

1386
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,740
Is it a cat paw?

1387
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,660
It should be a cat paw.

1388
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,540
Isn't it a cat paw?

1389
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,660
Yes.

1390
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:35,740
What is it?

1391
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,580
Any clues?

1392
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,500
A phone.

1393
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,740
What?

1394
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,340
He sent a message to his girlfriend.

1395
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,500
I still remember

1396
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,060
the first time we met.

1397
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,860
You make me believe

1398
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,980
that we can't be together

1399
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,260
for a long time.

1400
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,260
Then he told the girl

1401
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,300
that we should forget it.

1402
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,780
Thank you for letting me love you.

1403
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,460
But the distance you promised me

1404
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,580
is all fake.

1405
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,500
What about love?

1406
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,340
It's just that I made a mistake

1407
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,700
in all the men I met.

1408
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,220
What should I do to make you satisfied?

1409
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,860
You don't deserve to have the right to love me.

1410
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,260
He will give me more every day.

1411
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,740
It's totally different from you.

1412
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,580
From now on,

1413
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,500
I won't be your friend.

1414
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
Friend?

1415
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,980
It's written girlfriend.

1416
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:25,700
So strange.

1417
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,100
I won't be your friend.

1418
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,900
I won't.

1419
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,180
And you made a mistake.

1420
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,860
You won't be your friend.

1421
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,420
I won't be your friend.

1422
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,420
What's going on?

1423
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,620
What else can we see?

1424
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,260
Only this.

1425
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,020
Only this.

1426
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:43,940
Push it.

1427
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:45,820
OK.

1428
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,700
Please sit down.

1429
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,100
Come on.

1430
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,300
So this should be

1431
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,660
the phone of Lao Mu, right?

1432
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:51,900
Yes.

1433
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,140
This is a phone of Lao Mu.

1434
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,940
Lao Mu's home.

1435
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,340
Home?

1436
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:54,900
Found it.

1437
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,340
I want to say who Lao Mu is.

1438
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,660
It's the owner of this store.

1439
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,820
Isn't he called Lao Lin?

1440
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,820
Yes.

1441
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,940
Isn't he Boss Lin?

1442
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,740
When he came here...

1443
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,220
My surname is Lin.

1444
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,340
You can call me Lao Lin.

1445
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:09,860
That's Lao Lin.

1446
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,820
He's half smaller.

1447
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,500
Is it possible that he's a person called Lao Lin?

1448
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,580
And he's divided into two people.

1449
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,740
His name is Lao Mu No. 1 and Lao Mu No. 2.

1450
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,940
It's a combination of Lin and Mu.

1451
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,220
No.

1452
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,140
Or is it possible that

1453
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,060
the person he mentioned is Lao Lin

1454
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,220
and this person is Lao Mu?

1455
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,860
Lin is a little more than Lao Mu.

1456
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,020
But the person in this photo

1457
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,420
is clearly Lao Lin.

1458
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:46,980
Yes.

1459
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,540
The names of these animals have changed.

1460
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,740
The land has turned black.

1461
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,500
It's possible that it's this one.

1462
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,500
It's like a puppy.

1463
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,020
You have two identities.

1464
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,100
Two spaces.

1465
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,300
ZOO8, a сор singing angel.

1466
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,300
Rest like a angel.

1467
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,660
Why can't he be me?

1468
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,100
Okay, a big sigh.

1469
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,660
Is this a real or fake him?

1470
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,580
Seven words

1471
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,500
We all don't know each other?

1472
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,780
I'm so happy.

1473
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,540
Let's watch it again.

1474
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,100
I still remember

1475
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,060
the scene we first met.

1476
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,380
You make me believe

1477
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,940
that it's really a thousand years.

1478
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,740
Their words are a little weird.

1479
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,180
It's a little weird.

1480
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,900
It's like a song.

1481
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,660
Do you feel it?

1482
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,220
Song?

1483
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,260
It's like a song.

1484
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,060
A thousand years.

1485
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,540
A thousand years.

1486
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,020
Yes.

1487
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,020
How many reincarnations are there?

1488
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,860
What's the name of this song?

1489
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,220
I think it's called A Thousand Years.

1490
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,700
Yes.

1491
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,580
Is there a common surname?

1492
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,580
In every sentence,

1493
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,060
there is actually a song name.

1494
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,420
For example, A Thousand Years.

1495
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,580
This is a song name, right?

1496
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,860
And then?

1497
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,340
But the distance you promised to give me is all fake.

1498
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,340
Which of these words is the song name?

1499
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,540
The distance seems to be a song.

1500
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,980
I said true.

1501
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,140
Love is a mistake

1502
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,660
that all men would make at that time.

1503
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,020
I don't know.

1504
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,700
Do you know?

1505
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,740
Do you know?

1506
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,380
Can you smell it?

1507
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,820
All men make mistakes.

1508
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:50,060
What kind of man are you?

1509
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,300
I look at him and I don't ask.

1510
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,100
It's so nice.

1511
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,060
You are good at singing.

1512
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:58,660
It doesn't matter.

1513
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,020
I'll come back to you when I perform.

1514
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:00,540
I'll vote for you.

1515
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,020
How do I do it?

1516
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:05,660
Do you know?

1517
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,420
Love is a song, right?

1518
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,460
Are they all songs of SHE?

1519
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,180
SHE.

1520
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,660
Yes.

1521
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,540
Love Me is also SHE.

1522
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,700
SHE.

1523
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,180
All his songs.

1524
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,140
All their songs.

1525
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,540
Wang Yi's team.

1526
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,740
Yes.

1527
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,540
I know.

1528
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,420
Maybe they are using

1529
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,100
the meaning of the lyrics

1530
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,980
to communicate.

1531
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,660
Maybe they are using the code.

1532
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,140
They are not talking about this.

1533
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,260
Yes, they are not talking about this.

1534
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,980
Snake.

1535
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:41,580
Snake.

1536
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,140
Snake.

1537
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,860
Snake.

1538
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,460
Snake.

1539
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,220
Snake.

1540
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,740
Snake.

1541
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,260
Snake.

1542
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:53,740
Snake.

1543
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,740
Snake.

1544
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,780
Yes.

1545
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,620
Where is the snake?

1546
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,780
The snake in the costume.

1547
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,900
The pattern on the front is a snake.

1548
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,380
The pattern looks like a snake.

1549
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,140
So what is it?

1550
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,820
Is it related to the snake?

1551
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,460
Let's go back and explore

1552
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,020
to see if there is anything

1553
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,820
related to snakes in this garden.

1554
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,740
OK.

1555
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,060
Let's see the snakes.

1556
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:28,660
Let's go.

1557
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,060
Snake.

1558
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,460
Snake.

1559
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,900
Go.

1560
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,460
Where?

1561
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,940
Let's go to this platform.

1562
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,660
Isn't this the one?

1563
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,420
Isn't this the color of the snake garden?

1564
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,140
Halliburton.

1565
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,100
Why are you...

1566
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:49,660
Here.

1567
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,420
This is called the animal snake.

1568
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,020
Can you see it?

1569
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,460
OK.

1570
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,900
The snake is the total of four animals

1571
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,660
that are deformed.

1572
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,620
When they are deformed, the snake's body

1573
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,500
is on the ground.

1574
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,580
The water stops and the pattern is curved.

1575
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,900
The power is lost behind the curved area.

1576
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,420
Yes.

1577
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,620
Yes.

1578
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,660
Yes.

1579
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,900
Who is crying?

1580
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,620
It's me.

1581
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,220
It's me.

1582
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,100
How do you know?

1583
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,060
Take one.

1584
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,060
OK.

1585
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,140
Here it comes.

1586
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,020
The snake is coming.

1587
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:33,660
Oh my god.

1588
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,860
The snake is coming.

1589
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,820
It's coming.

1590
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:36,700
Where?

1591
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,460
Behind you.

1592
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,380
Zhang Wei.

1593
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,180
You are so annoying.

1594
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,540
Why are you living here?

1595
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,060
What are you doing here?

1596
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,820
Zhu.

1597
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,740
You are not Zhu, right?

1598
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,460
What is Zhu?

1599
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:52,860
Hello.

1600
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,180
Who are you?

1601
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,660
I'm the younger sister of Mu.

1602
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,300
The younger sister of Mu?

1603
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,660
What's your name?

1604
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:59,860
I'm Xiao Mu.

1605
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:03,740
This is the place where my brother and I often come.

1606
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,340
After my brother left,

1607
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,580
I stayed here alone.

1608
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,580
It's like he's still by my side.

1609
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,740
So what are you doing here?

1610
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,380
You have disturbed my chat with my brother.

1611
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,340
You just chatted with your brother?

1612
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,940
Do you know where Mu is?

1613
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,940
My brother has been gone for many years.

1614
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,500
Do you know how he left?

1615
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,300
I don't know how he left.

1616
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,060
You are here to investigate my brother's death, right?

1617
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,460
Yes.

1618
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,980
We look different.

1619
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,500
But we are actually detectives.

1620
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,740
We are famous detectives.

1621
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,420
We think Mu died in a strange way.

1622
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,780
So we have to find out the truth.

1623
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:39,300
That's right.

1624
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,820
So what are you doing here?

1625
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,620
Does your brother like the song of L.C.H?

1626
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,620
He is a fan of L.C.H.

1627
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,460
I don't know what you are talking about.

1628
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,460
Where is the snake?

1629
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,540
Are you looking for the snake?

1630
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,220
That's right.

1631
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,300
I know where the snake is.

1632
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,860
You show us the clue, then we'll go.

1633
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,980
The snake is there.

1634
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,180
It's in that place.

1635
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,020
Here.

1636
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,180
Is it under the lake?

1637
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:02,580
Yes.

1638
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:03,780
You go find it.

1639
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,100
I'll give you the flashlight.

1640
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:05,660
Okay, thank you.

1641
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,180
I'm going to continue chatting with my brother.

1642
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,700
What are you chatting with your brother?

1643
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,660
Their family affairs.

1644
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,220
You know so much.

1645
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,020
Let's go.

1646
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,300
Wait a minute.

1647
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,620
It's okay.

1648
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,380
Okay.

1649
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,300
You go.

1650
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,340
Don't let him go last.

1651
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,020
I won't scare you if I go last.

1652
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,580
I'm not that boring.

1653
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,620
You are very boring.

1654
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,460
He just said that the snake is here.

1655
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,660
A little bit to the left.

1656
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,540
This way.

1657
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,060
That's right.

1658
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,140
What's this?

1659
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:44,940
A necklace.

1660
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:45,980
Really?

1661
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,940
Really.

1662
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,100
There's really a necklace.

1663
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,340
What's that?

1664
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,340
There's a god here.

1665
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,100
Wait a minute.

1666
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:54,860
This god.

1667
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,100
Is this?

1668
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,620
It seems to be a god.

1669
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,660
It's a snake.

1670
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,660
It's a snake.

1671
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,660
It's a snake.

1672
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:08,660
It's a snake.

1673
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,660
It's a snake.

1674
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,660
It's a snake.

1675
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,660
It's a snake.

1676
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,660
It's a snake.

1677
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,360
There's a snake.

1678
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,820
This is not in areas are in the forest.

1679
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,820
It looks like trap.

1680
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,820
What are you doing?

1681
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,020
Don't be afraid.

1682
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,020
It's really very scary.

1683
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,820
Are you scared?

1684
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:36,940
It's dark.

1685
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,580
Where are we?

1686
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:40,900
I also feel a bit scared.

1687
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,940
It's about to come back here.

1688
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,740
What is this?

1689
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:43,540
Map

1690
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,860
There is a place on it

1691
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:48,660
called

1692
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,940
Push-Pulling

1693
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,540
Food factory

1694
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,540
This is another place

1695
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,140
Zhe told us

1696
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:57,700
the truth

1697
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,980
is related to this

1698
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,100
Push-Pulling Food Factory

1699
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,220
To reveal this secret

1700
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,420
we must explore differently

1701
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,620
every place in here

1702
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,580
Because now some places

1703
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,300
the names on it

1704
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,660
are blocked by smoke

1705
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:09,860
Yes

1706
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,140
Now only the Push-Pulling Food Factory

1707
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,100
is revealed

1708
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:13,540
Let's find out

1709
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,660
where is the Push-Pulling Food Factory

1710
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,540
Let's go

1711
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,780
What's going on?

1712
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,460
It exploded

1713
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,660
Why did it explode?

1714
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:45,780
Oh no

1715
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,820
There is something wrong with the smoke

1716
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,180
What should we do next?

1717
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,380
Don't panic

1718
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,980
Do you remember who you are?

1719
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,420
I am Bai Yu

1720
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,500
I am Dilraba

1721
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,180
I am Jing Jing

1722
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,540
I am Liu Yuning

1723
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,660
I am Zhang Linghe

1724
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,340
I am Zhou Keyu

1725
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,260
Do you remember your mission?

1726
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:05,860
I don't remember

1727
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,540
Where are we?

1728
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,660
I don't remember

1729
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,100
Where are we?

1730
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:10,900
What are we going to do?

1731
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,100
Do we have any mission?

1732
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,100
Today is the day

1733
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,380
you six

1734
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,660
get together with the Limousine Group

1735
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,860
It's also the first day

1736
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,740
you start your mission

1737
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,540
Your mission

1738
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,380
is to find a very important person

1739
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,580
This person is very dangerous

1740
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,020
Did we just

1741
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,140
see that person?

1742
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,380
The man in black just now

1743
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,780
It must be the man in black

1744
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:30,980
who didn't catch up just now

1745
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:31,940
It's him

1746
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,460
He appeared in the last place

1747
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,260
It happens to be the place

1748
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,860
where you get together

1749
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,900
You came here

1750
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,340
to solve him

1751
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,700
the trouble he caused

1752
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,420
I didn't expect him to be exposed to amnesia

1753
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,100
Your mission failed

1754
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,540
But it doesn't matter

1755
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,420
There is still a chance

1756
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,580
Didn't you find

1757
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,100
a place related to him?

1758
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,100
He has appeared in other places

1759
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,940
I can let you

1760
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,460
go to those places

1761
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,820
through the same voice

1762
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,020
Be sure to stop him

1763
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:07,140
Welcome to the Cui Xian execution ground

1764
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,740
The first mission is to find the person who killed the boss

1765
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,700
I think we sing

1766
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,900
in a strange way

1767
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,180
I'm scared

1768
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:17,940
Boss

1769
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,620
He didn't die when he was lying here

1770
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,060
He was beaten to death

1771
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,900
I've been observing

1772
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,340
the boss's actions

1773
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,940
The boss should not be a good person

1774
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,580
Is he a human or a ghost?

1775
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,940
Like a corpse, right?

1776
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,500
The white man is the one who killed our Tang

1777
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,780
He bled and became a mule

1778
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,180
The Cui Xian execution ground is a three-way factory

1779
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,460
It's the most honorable

1780
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,380
He killed someone again

1781
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,700
He just came yesterday

1782
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,260
He was exposed

1783
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,700
The bomb was just blown

1784
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,060
We were electrocuted

1785
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,740
He wants to punish us

1786
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,460
I don't know

1787
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,180
I don't know either

1788
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:54,980
We are all the same

1789
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,420
We all saw him for the first time

1790
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,380
So

1791
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,740
There is only one

1792
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,820
The violence is so intense

1793
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,020
The noise is so loud

1794
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:02,740
The cave

1795
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,860
There are so many people here

1796
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,980
The loser died here

1797
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,260
The more you come, the deeper you get

1798
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,020
Help

1799
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,700
He wants to see us die all at once
