00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The first episode of the show

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first episode of the show

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The first episode of the show

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome to the Group C

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Group C begins

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Season 3 is waiting for you

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We are new tenants who just moved in

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In the 11th floor

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We will be neighbors

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Can you take care of it

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Bai Song, Yi Guo Zhou, Liu Yicheng, Guo Jingyu

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because we are family

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What is this

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are now going to escape

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The power of the fish is flying

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Start to fly

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you remember who you are

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Your task is to find a very important person

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can let you go to those places through the rebirth

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:24,880
Now only the

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Teacher

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't uncomfortable

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It is also very hiding

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Be careful

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't ά

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
R We don't know

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
The relevant persons have been locked up

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,200
Hand-held welding gun

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,360
Melt iron bar

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,840
Hello everyone

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,360
I am the welding craftsman of Tui Tian Food Factory

56
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,280
White man

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,480
This room is my dormitory

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,360
This is my bed

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,760
I usually rest here

60
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,040
This is my desk

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,000
There are some small white swords that I like

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
Yes

63
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,800
These

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,960
And some tools

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,560
This is my award

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,320
Come and see

67
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,240
This is my award

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,920
So I'm still very good

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,880
I am the star craftsman of this factory

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,600
Although it's not long to come to the factory

71
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,480
But because of the excellent business level

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,240
I am very admired by the boss

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
There was a suspicious person who ran over

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,080
Found the body

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
And he didn't stop him

76
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,240
That person is not from our factory

77
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,920
So suspicious

78
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,200
He just

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
You should say you

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
I am Tui Tan

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,720
I am Tui Tan

82
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Perform well

83
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,880
Take off your shoes

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,440
Always command others to work

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,960
Because I am a noble Tui Tan master

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,960
You have to find it

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,520
Take a good look at the shelf

88
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
You are so tall

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,000
You have to clean up your work

90
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,880
You have no clues or evidence here

91
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,960
You are so clean

92
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,080
There is a problem

93
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,120
Why do you use a computer as a security guard?

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,920
Of course I'm watching the surveillance

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,760
You see the surveillance

96
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,840
Isn't that surveillance?

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm speechless

98
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,960
Your security

99
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,480
I

100
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,880
Hit your own person

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,920
Who is your own person

102
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,280
What did I do wrong?

103
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,120
And bully me like this

104
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,680
Someone is deliberately

105
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,680
This is our boss

106
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,400
He will give us

107
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,480
He was bullied

108
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,400
He will

109
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,040
The problem is solved

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,520
I am the outside worker of Tui Tan candy factory

111
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,320
Yes

112
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,160
What you see now is where I work

113
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,000
I am

114
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,160
Lin Gengpa

115
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,800
Because I am in our Tui Tan food factory every week

116
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,520
Only need to work for two days

117
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,280
So

118
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
This is also a place for me to stay

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,680
Let's take a look

120
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,280
Look here

121
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
This military bed

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,400
Is where I usually rest here

123
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,920
And there are all kinds of

124
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,360
These maintenance appliances

125
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,200
Anyway, as long as I'm here

126
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,160
All power plants and heaters in the food factory

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,320
Are related to me

128
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,440
I also hope you can support my work more and more

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,160
I am the candy factory first

130
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,920
Everyone knows that I am the electrician here

131
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,400
You just talk

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
No practical action at all

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,640
What did you send

134
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,080
They two sent things

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,560
Let me tell you

136
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,080
This man is too unreliable

137
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,800
Use this broken purple box

138
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,600
To make my daughter cry

139
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
Make me a broken purple box

140
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,360
At least send a cup

141
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Hello everyone

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,640
I only want 8 points of sweetness

143
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,600
You can get super sweet 8 points of sugar

144
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,120
And today

145
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,520
We came to my work room

146
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,200
And I'm going to take you to do a simple

147
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,920
My room

148
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,800
A introduction of my working environment

149
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
First of all, this is the candy

150
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,640
This candy is my daily work

151
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,520
What I'm going to do is

152
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,000
It needs our staff

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,320
After handing me this net

154
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,520
I will put this

155
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,800
The candy with the jellyfish

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,480
Then put it all in the net

157
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,880
And then give it to him

158
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,520
Send it out like this

159
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,440
This is my daily very simple

160
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,440
And

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
A rather boring job

162
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,840
I'll sit here

163
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,800
And this is the candy I need to pack every day

164
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
And here

165
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,600
Is

166
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,240
After I deliver these candies

167
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
I need to find bags again

168
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,440
Those bags are there

169
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,600
Then put these candies

170
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
In the packing bag separately

171
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,680
And wait for the next round of net

172
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,720
This is the work I need to do

173
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,520
The next round of net

174
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,560
My name is 8 points of sugar

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,320
I'm 20 years old today

176
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,520
I'm the candy packer of this candy factory

177
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,320
There's a password

178
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,560
There's a password

179
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,120
The password is

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,560
Is it possible?

181
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,800
Really

182
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
Really

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,800
You are suspicious

184
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,720
It's written on it

185
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,560
Yes

186
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Wait

187
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,160
You are more scary

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,240
Really

189
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,680
There's a woman who keeps screaming

190
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,800
And then she found out it was her

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
It's on your poster

192
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,920
It's on the opposite of that

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,680
Opposite

194
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,280
There's a opposite of the entrance

195
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,680
Yes

196
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
The white lion's team is opposite

197
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,200
There's another one

198
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,080
It might be in this box

199
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm so confused

200
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,840
All done

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
The food is always on time

202
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,120
The meal is never late

203
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,200
I am the sugar cook of the candy factory

204
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,680
Chicken soup spoon

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,520
This is the knife I inherited from my family

206
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,200
With it, all the shredded green onion will look more like shredded green onion

207
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,720
All the ginger slices will look more like ginger slices

208
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,800
This is my special menu

209
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,320
Please read it by yourself

210
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,480
This is my love pot

211
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,200
My people are the ones who eat my food

212
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,520
This is my secret peanut oil

213
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,720
Every peanut is made by myself

214
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,800
I love peanuts

215
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,200
Life is not like water

216
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,280
But you need to drink some water

217
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,800
Dear white lion's team, please drink some water

218
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,600
My soup is like water

219
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
You two

220
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,920
In the factory

221
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
You know

222
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
You are not in this story

223
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
How can you do this

224
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,360
So

225
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,720
It's me

226
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,320
No matter what my identity is

227
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
As a civil servant

228
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,040
If I am a consumer

229
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,720
If I am fooled

230
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,280
I will go to the authority

231
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,320
I will wear my black dress

232
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,560
Qianren

233
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,320
Tell me why

234
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
So it's you

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
Except for two detectives

236
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Can ask me questions

237
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,720
No one

238
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,160
No one wants to question me

239
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,160
I have a technique

240
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,080
There is a technique

241
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,840
Can you do it

242
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,280
Don't you think I'm like this

243
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,480
Just give up

244
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,480
You found out

245
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,240
So you were

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,160
You are to save your life

247
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,560
So

248
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,960
He may also

249
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
So different circles

250
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,440
Different circles

251
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,360
Different intersection

252
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,600
The ____ is always inside

253
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,640
So in my heart

254
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,920
I think ____ is more important

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,280
Hello, everyone

256
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,640
The water mud team called me the king

257
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm the most crazy person in the brick and crab goods

258
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,200
I am the water mud worker of the TuiTian Video Factory

259
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,800
And the decoration worker

260
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,520
He Yiba

261
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,880
Today I will take you to

262
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
Take a look at my dormitory

263
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,640
As the most powerful and the most

264
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
A man of culture

265
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,520
You see my dormitory is very clear

266
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,560
It's full of the feeling of power

267
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,720
And the hormone of men

268
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,960
How about this doll

269
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,000
Is it very strong

270
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,400
This is my body

271
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,360
That's right

272
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,880
And some sports equipment

273
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,200
Is where I usually keep my power

274
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,840
There is no show of my mental and physical brain

275
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,720
But

276
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,160
The workers all know

277
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
I graduated from the business school

278
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
I usually help them do some

279
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,560
Economic planning

280
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
They all worship me very much

281
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,280
That's right

282
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm the water mud team

283
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,160
I'm just an ordinary employee

284
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
In my eyes, only him

285
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
In my eyes, only him

286
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,560
I send him my old photos every day

287
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,520
Oh my god

288
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,640
Is this the end of the year

289
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,040
So what's your motive for killing

290
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,800
You ask me one

291
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
What is the motive for killing a good person

292
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
No, what are you doing in the security?

293
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,920
I'm not a good person

294
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm not a good person

295
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm not a good person

296
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm not a good person

297
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,280
What are you doing

298
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,080
This person is in the prison

299
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,920
You can't see it, can you

300
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,760
I met you

301
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,480
What are you doing

302
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
What are you doing

303
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,040
Open that door

304
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,400
You can't open the door inside

305
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,960
That's right

306
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,680
That video

307
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,080
May be

308
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,400
Hello, everyone

309
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,040
I am Ke'an

310
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,480
I am the guardian of our farm food factory

311
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,840
Because I am a security guard

312
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
One piece of peace

313
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,160
That's right

314
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,120
This is my profession

315
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,400
In my room

316
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,320
There are a lot of self-portraits

317
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,320
That's right

318
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,360
These are all me

319
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
Of course, I can't leave this sword

320
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,840
This sword is Dong Kuang's sword

321
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,080
Actually, the sword on the poster

322
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,760
Here it is

323
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,360
If you can see it

324
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,280
The sword in his hand

325
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,120
Can't be printed

326
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
Because his size is limited

327
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,360
Indeed, the hero I like the most

328
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,000
So his weapons are also stored in it

329
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,480
Know it

330
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,440
Very simple

331
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,520
I come here to be a security guard

332
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,360
I'll come here to guard his safety

333
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,440
You work here

334
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,680
And he died here

335
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,560
I can vote

336
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,600
It's not that simple

337
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,000
It's not that simple, okay

338
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,920
Did you send this

339
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,160
Ke'an, did you send this

340
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,120
I don't remember this

341
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,800
You don't remember when you were beaten by me

342
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,880
I remember you beat me

343
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
But it's because of this

344
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,720
You don't remember

345
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,080
No

346
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
You don't know if you're beaten

347
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,080
No

348
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
I was really beaten by him

349
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
Your work capacity is so small

350
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,960
Your work capacity is so high

351
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,080
I work so hard

352
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
I'm here every day to watch you

353
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,560
You can't even catch a black person

354
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,360
What hard work

355
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,000
I didn't do anything

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
You're just standing there

357
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,760
The sun is setting

358
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
The sun is setting

359
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,400
Yes

360
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,760
The sun is setting

361
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,040
Wait a minute

362
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,760
You stand at the door first

363
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Why?

364
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,120
Li Xian

365
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,200
OK

366
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,240
Golden spoon

367
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,200
Don't explain too much

368
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Golden spoon

369
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,840
Really, I'm very suspicious of him now

370
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,760
I think you were beaten by me

371
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,160
I was beaten so hard

372
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,960
I tell you

373
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,800
This person can't make sure

374
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,360
When can I make this

375
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,040
When I make this mistake

376
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,840
He has one thing to be sure

377
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,120
That is

378
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,520
I did see him

379
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,760
Today, brother

380
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,840
Give him a big credit

381
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
The mission card

382
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,720
The mission card

383
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
Today's game is

384
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,400
Challenge with five points

385
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,720
Find your right five points in two minutes

386
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Try to get a complete face

387
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,360
At the same time, in the process of trying to get five points

388
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,960
When the character appears in the song

389
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,680
You need to make a command action on time

390
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,800
If you make five mistakes or two in total

391
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,280
Fail to complete the challenge correctly

392
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,880
Only players who have played the game

393
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,720
Can choose one benefit

394
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,680
One benefit

395
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,640
One benefit

396
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
One benefit

397
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
One benefit

398
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
One benefit

399
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
One benefit

400
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
One benefit

401
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Five

402
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,640
I can't see it at all

403
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,160
I can't see it at all

404
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,520
This is too difficult

405
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,600
No

406
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,720
Is this to put all the people together

407
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,960
Or just put one together

408
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Put myself together

409
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,920
Put myself together

410
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,560
Put yourself together

411
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,600
sharing

412
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,760
playing

413
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,560
have you

414
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,720
Just do what you're doing

415
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,600
Find your right five points

416
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
Find one of the best

417
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,560
лек basin

418
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,400
I like love

419
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,360
This is your taste

420
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,560
I want your love

421
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,000
The class8

422
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,720
I found this

423
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,920
every time

424
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,360
The memory of love is the memory of the game

425
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,880
Challenge failed

426
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,360
The nose is mine

427
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,720
Does this nose have my nose?

428
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,680
Which is my nose?

429
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm all stupid

430
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,320
I

431
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,840
Good

432
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,560
This is not it

433
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,280
Is it

434
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,600
Come on, come on, you find it for me

435
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
I really don't know which one

436
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,640
The eyes are not yours

437
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,880
This eye is wrong

438
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,520
No

439
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,280
Your eyebrows are big

440
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,160
The one you just drew

441
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,280
It should be Da Xun's eye

442
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,880
Yes

443
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
It's really my brother Da Xun

444
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,840
The eyes are not yours

445
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,680
Come on, come on, you find it for me

446
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,640
It's really this one

447
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,560
Congratulations on your challenge

448
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,280
Bye

449
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,320
Bye

450
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,240
It's the memory of love

451
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,360
The memory of love is the memory of the game

452
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Just love you like this

453
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
Love you, love you, love you

454
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,000
Always together

455
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,080
I like to love you

456
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,760
Change the taste

457
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,720
And your arms

458
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Don't be afraid

459
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
Smile

460
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
For love

461
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Love

462
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I don't care

463
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I don't care

464
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,320
The wrong action is almost five times

465
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,800
Okay

466
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,480
It's a pity that you failed to challenge the first benefit

467
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
I really can't recognize myself

468
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,200
That's good

469
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,160
This is all cute

470
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,760
Then we're ready to start

471
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,320
Wait a minute

472
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,840
Ready, good

473
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,360
it is good

474
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Just love you like this

475
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,000
Love you like this

476
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
Love you, love you, love you

477
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,360
Always together

478
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,520
I like to love you

479
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Change the taste

480
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
And your arms

481
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,440
The memory of love is the memory of the game

482
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
Don't be afraid

483
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Love you like this

484
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Let you understand

485
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,440
And I love you like this

486
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,400
No

487
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,440
Whose nose is this

488
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Love you like this

489
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,040
Okay

490
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,480
Are you sure this is the answer?

491
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,960
Okay

492
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,480
Still have to continue

493
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,200
Still sure

494
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,920
Wait a minute

495
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,480
Let me see

496
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,520
Then let's continue playing

497
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Okay, keep playing

498
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,040
Congratulations on your test

499
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm not done yet

500
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,320
You

501
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,880
Ready

502
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
Just love you, love you, love you

503
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,920
Love you like this

504
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,360
Love you like this

505
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,840
Love you, love you, love you

506
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,720
Always together

507
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I like to love you

508
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,480
Change the taste

509
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,560
And your arms

510
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,360
Whose nose is this

511
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,200
My nose is pretty good

512
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,080
Which one is yours

513
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,520
But my nose is pretty big

514
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,840
It should be this

515
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,600
Are you sure

516
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,040
Sure

517
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,280
Who are the others

518
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
I want the nose in the first place

519
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,360
I want to try

520
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,600
Is this

521
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,240
This is Mao Buyi's nose

522
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,880
You see, it's quite suitable

523
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Which one is Zhang Linghe's nose

524
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,080
This

525
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,640
It's okay to be a little bit

526
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,560
Then I'll count down and start

527
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,040
Okay

528
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,980
Wait a minute

529
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,800
I will count down for you

530
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,040
This is my entering

531
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
You see, this is me

532
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,120
Who else is here

533
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,680
This is me

534
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,520
I get it

535
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,840
My name is dizhi

536
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,400
Yauku

537
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
You're done.

538
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Congratulations. You're done.

539
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Done.

540
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Start.

541
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Yes.

542
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Are you sure?

543
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Of course.

544
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Correct.

545
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
And the bonus?

546
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Bonus. Hurry up.

547
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
There are three kinds of bonus.

548
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Choose one.

549
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Push good food to the cafeteria.

550
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Push attractive little cloth.

551
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
And push interesting props.

552
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Let's do little cloth.

553
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Little cloth. Pink.

554
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
I want pink.

555
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Props.

556
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Cuisine, little cloth.

557
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Props.

558
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Just bring whatever you want to eat, right?

559
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Then I'll just bring whatever I want.

560
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Big mouth, big mouth.

561
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
All the same.

562
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
I want to eat walnuts.

563
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Because I'm Zhang Linhe's little walnuts.

564
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
I can eat them all, right?

565
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Perfect. You made a good choice.

566
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Just this one.

567
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Just this one.

568
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Unlimited supply of vitamin C.

569
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
I want to choose a

570
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
jade jade.

571
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Guess what it is.

572
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,400
It will predict the danger in advance.

573
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
And then there's a warning that will ring.

574
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
The warning will ring.

575
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Why is this jade jade?

576
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Explain it.

577
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
You can poke the hole in the front.

578
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
In the dark.

579
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
OK. Give it to me.

580
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I'll use this to beat the white fish later.

581
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
See how I beat it later.

582
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
The first round of the game is over.

583
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
The first round of the game is over.

584
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
The second round of the game is over.

585
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
The third round of the game is over.

586
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
The fourth round of the game is over.

587
