1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The game failed.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The real culprit is

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ba Fen Tang.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Next, let's ask Ba Fen Tang

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to announce if there is an X in this episode.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The real culprit is

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ba Fen Tang.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Next, let's ask Ba Fen Tang

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to announce if there is an X in this episode.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The real culprit is

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ba Fen Tang.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am the murderer of this case, Ba Fen Tang.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Actually, when I went to Tan Jian's office,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I found a big secret

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
besides that he is my enemy.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There was a secret room

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in his office.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The screen in the secret room was monitoring

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
all the workers in the factory.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I didn't expect that

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
there were so many hidden cameras

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in our workplace.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And some of the background of the base has been changing.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He is a bad guy.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
At that moment,

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I realized that the green wall in the factory

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
was actually for easy

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to change the background.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All of us were being filmed by hidden cameras

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and became the unknown protagonist.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The information in the secret room showed that

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the hidden cameras in the factory

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
would stop checking every 25th, 6.30 to 8 o'clock.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Fortunately, I saw this information.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Otherwise,

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
if I killed Tan Jian,

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the crime would be recorded by the cameras.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now I want to take revenge.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Besides hiding the workers in the factory,

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I also want to avoid being filmed by hidden cameras

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and the whole process of the crime.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
At the same time, I also found his phone manual.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
His phone actually has two systems.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can enter different codes

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and different systems.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This may be useful for me.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
When I got back to the dorm, I started thinking about how to kill people.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Suddenly, I thought that it was about 25th.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can do the crime

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
in the half hour of the stopwatch.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In order not to let the workers in the factory

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
know about me,

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I can use the green button and the door lock button

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to do an impossible crime.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
When I was packing sugar,

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
my hand was accidentally slipped by the candy.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The blood flowed to the candy.

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The candy fell into the candy and I couldn't find it.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But a few days later,

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I found that the candy was stuck to my blood

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and was brought back to me by the delivery bag.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I secretly started investigating.

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I found that every time the candy

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
was packed and loaded, it didn't go out of stock.

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Instead, it was opened to the factory.

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The candy was then opened again.

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The candy was then delivered to my workplace.

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That is to say,

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the candy I packed every day was the same candy.

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I also noticed that

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
around 7 a.m. every day,

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I would come to the breakfast and go to the second floor

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
through the back door of the back door.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But only the fingerprint of the front door could be opened.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I couldn't go upstairs.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
As for why the factory did this,

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know where the second floor is.

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But now, the back door, the delivery bag,

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and the information about opening the delivery door

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and the information about the front door

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
are all useful to me.

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The sugar-coated spoon would send the prepared breakfast

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
to the dormitory of our construction workers

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
every day at almost 7 a.m.

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
After the delivery, it would return to the room to eat.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
According to my observation,

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
after it returned to the room to rest,

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
no one would appear in the canteen.

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If I dare to go to the canteen's delivery window,

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
at almost 7 a.m.,

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I would spray the other end of the canteen window

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and move it to the canteen through the window.

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then I would download the second system of the phone

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and install the green wall of the canteen

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
into the living room.

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I would make it look like it was dead at 7 a.m.

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
in the living room.

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
At 6.30 a.m. on February 25, 2025,

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
all the cameras in the factory were stopped

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and stopped shooting.

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
At 6.57 a.m., the sugar-coated spoon would send the food

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and I would open the door to welcome it.

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
At 6.58 a.m., I heard the sugar-coated spoon

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
returning to the room to rest at the door.

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I sneaked out to the canteen to deliver the food

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and sprayed the other end of the canteen

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
with the strong sleep spray.

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The sugar-coated spoon fell down immediately.

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I moved it from the back door to the canteen.

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
At 6.59 a.m., I placed several boxes

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
in front of the green wall of the canteen

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and arranged them like the living room.

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I put the sugar-coated spoon in front of the box.

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I wore a black robe

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and downloaded the video recording software

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
of the green screen background

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
with the second system of the phone.

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I would then put the photos of the canteen into the video recording software.

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
At 7 a.m., I plugged the phone into the paper box

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and adjusted the position.

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I started recording the video recording software

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and walked to the canteen

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,380
with the work

126
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
and then walked back to the phone position

127
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,380
and pressed the stop button.

128
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,380
I checked the video and it looked like

129
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,380
it was recorded in the car hall.

130
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
There was no flaw.

131
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,380
I was satisfied with the video recording of the first system of the phone

132
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,380
and confirmed that the recording time was 7 o'clock.

133
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,380
There was no change because the system was switched.

134
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,380
At 7 a.m.,

135
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,380
I took the sugar-coated spoon back to the room

136
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,380
and moved the body from the canteen to the back door.

137
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
Then I transferred the body

138
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
to the car room and placed it under the dust under the dust.

139
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
I placed the phone and the body

140
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
near the body.

141
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
At 7 a.m., I processed the black robe

142
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
and returned to the canteen

143
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
by the delivery bag

144
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
and quickly returned to my room.

145
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
The video showed that the canteen was killed

146
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
by someone at 7 a.m.

147
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
According to the door record,

148
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
I could not enter the car hall.

149
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Even if the back door was discovered,

150
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
it took more than three minutes to take the delivery bag.

151
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
The gold spoon can prove that I got the breakfast at 6 a.m.

152
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,140
I could not enter the car hall in such a short time.

153
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,140
I could also get rid of the suspicion.

154
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,140
The next test

155
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,140
The video studio, tofu shop,

156
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,140
candy shop, detective club

157
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
So we have to guess

158
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
how many people are in this.

159
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,140
There is no one

160
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
in this candy shop.

161
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,140
No one.

162
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,140
So we have a total of six detectives

163
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,140
and

164
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
a total of six people.

165
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
So it's...

166
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
So it's...

167
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
So it's...

168
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Wait, it seems that the person is wrong.

169
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
The person who drew it is three girls.

170
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Two boys.

171
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
There are six people in total.

172
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
If you don't look at the picture

173
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
according to the number of people,

174
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
there should be one person here.

175
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
But because the picture is small,

176
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
the animation character

177
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
seems to be different from us.

178
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
So it should have nothing to do with us.

179
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
One is dead.

180
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,900
No, but there is a person in the room.

181
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
Yes, how many people are there in total?

182
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
So far, we can see five people.

183
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
If it has nothing to do with

184
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
us,

185
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
then the person in the video studio

186
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
is unknown.

187
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
So is it related to this word?

188
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
If it is related to freedom,

189
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
Tofu shop

190
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
There are three people here.

191
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
The one next to the person

192
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
And there are two people in the meat below.

193
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
There are three people in total, so there are three people.

194
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
And this detective

195
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
is

196
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
a single person

197
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
and there is a person

198
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
in the video studio.

199
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,660
So there are two people.

200
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
And there is no

201
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
person in the video studio.

202
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Or a person.

203
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
And in the food factory,

204
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,660
there is only one person.

205
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,660
So there is one person

206
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
in the food factory.

207
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,660
There are three people in the Tofu shop.

208
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,660
There are two people in the detective studio.

209
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,660
One person in the food factory.

210
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Congratulations, you got it right.

211
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,660
You can choose

212
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
to accompany the detective.

213
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Bai Hanzi and Ning Dengpao

214
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
I want to choose Bai Hanzi

215
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
to be my

216
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Because he has

217
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
a low card

218
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
and he can vote for two people.

219
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
The voting time can be changed to two votes.

220
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
He decided the game

221
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
to win this season.

222
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
He can help me. One is he helps me.

223
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
And he can vote for two people.

224
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
So there are three people who can help me win this game.

225
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,420
So I choose Bai Hanzi.

226
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,420
What does it mean to black and X?

227
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,420
What does it mean to black and black?

228
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,420
How to black and black?

229
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
For example, I am the murderer, you are the detective.

230
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
I said I don't need X today.

231
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
You can choose not to vote now.

232
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
But I will definitely choose.

233
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,420
Because the vote is high.

234
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,420
It's not necessarily. If it's gold,

235
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,420
I believe he will not choose.

236
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
Because he knows the variety effect.

237
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
I don't choose? What do I choose?

238
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Don't choose X.

239
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
You are very loyal.

240
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
I don't know if I understand variety.

241
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
But you are very hungry.

242
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
The relationship is waiting for a while.

243
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Isn't this the same as before?

244
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
There is a difference that can only be communicated once.

245
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
When we used to vote,

246
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
we were the murderer, I was X.

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
We have two votes.

248
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Before voting, you don't know who I voted for.

249
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
I don't know who you voted for.

250
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
So we may not be able to vote.

251
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Then you can vote in reality.

252
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,180
You can vote in reality.

253
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,180
For example, you know I'm X.

254
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,180
I said, I told you, it's him.

255
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,180
Then we may have wronged him.

256
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
I mean,

257
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,180
I told you, murderer.

258
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,180
I am a political detective.

259
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,180
It's no use blackening me.

260
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,180
I will still stand for my justice.

261
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,180
So it's like this.

262
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,180
Whoever chose X, he immediately said,

263
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,180
Who chose me just now?

264
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
He directly said,

265
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Let's play the game.

266
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
He said, let's play the game.

267
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
He is such a person.

268
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
He won't be like this.

269
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Are you sure you are X?

270
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Let's see if you are X.

271
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I will send you some facial muscles.

272
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
I haven't been through this for a long time.

273
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
You can see it when you come in.

274
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Go.

275
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Wait a minute, he has changed.

276
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
He didn't change in the last season.

277
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
What?

278
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
When you came in last season,

279
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
you can change your expression.

280
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
I remember it.

281
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,940
He is so cool.

282
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
I remember.

283
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
He must have gotten an X card and made a reaction.

284
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,940
He is here.

285
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Why did you choose me?

286
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,940
I have such a chance.

287
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,940
So you are X.

288
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,940
Last season was like this.

289
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,940
So you are X?

290
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,940
I am not.

291
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
I am not X.

292
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
I am definitely,

293
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
I am sure that I am X.

294
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,940
I am X.

295
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
So you are X.

296
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
I think our play today is normal.

297
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
For example, I ask you if you are the murderer.

298
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
You say I am.

299
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
It's strange.

300
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
What do you mean?

301
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
The normal play is, you have to tell the truth.

302
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
You are not.

303
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
You are in a good state.

304
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I feel you are in a good state.

305
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
When you say you are in a good state,

306
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
you immediately show a bad smile.

307
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
I am not.

308
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
I am secretly writing.

309
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
I am secretly writing.

310
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Why is Bai Han so fast?

311
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Because he is not X.

312
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
I think he is more like X.

313
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
Didn't you say you wanted to be a righteous person?

314
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Didn't you say you wanted to be a righteous person?

315
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
Yes, it's me.

316
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
I think he is X.

317
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
I think everyone will tell the truth.

318
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Because when people can't lie,

319
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,700
they will tell the truth.

320
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
He said I am not X.

321
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
You said it's me.

322
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
Then this is the truth.

323
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Then this is the truth.

324
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
If you are X,

325
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
I probably know who the murderer is.

326
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
I am not.

327
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Why are you talking to him about me?

328
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
He has become talkative, right?

329
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,460
Yes.

330
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,460
OK, I got it.

331
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,460
I have no choice.

332
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,460
Say more.

333
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,460
I was observing.

334
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
Did you use two votes today?

335
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,460
I did.

336
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,460
I said he is X.

337
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,460
He hasn't refuted me yet.

338
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
I didn't refute anyone.

339
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,460
He should say, don't pretend, you are.

340
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
I said I am.

341
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Then he started to say I am.

342
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,460
He should explain to us.

343
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
But he said he was looking at you.

344
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
He said I saw it.

345
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
OK.

346
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
He is very hard.

347
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Very hard.

348
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Let's go to his CPU.

349
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Let's CPU him today.

350
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
OK.

351
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Do you know who I am?

352
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
This girl lives here.

353
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Do you know who I am?

354
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
We can't be too harmonious.

355
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
He said the murderer is as motivated as he is.

356
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
He is very motivated.

357
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
He is motivated to say...

358
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
I am X.

359
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Do you want to change the vote?

360
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
I will change the vote.

361
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Zhang Linghe, I will touch your nose.

362
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,340
I will change the vote.

363
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,340
Zhang Linghe, I will touch your nose.

364
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Let's go back and communicate between X and the murderer.

365
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,340
You are very concerned about X and the murderer.

366
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,300
I'm also worried.

367
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,140
What did you say?

368
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,140
Who did you say?

369
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,980
Because Bai Yu,

370
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,460
you're not helping a good person.

371
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,380
Why?

372
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,780
Because you've been denying that you're X.

373
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,420
That's not right.

374
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,780
Then...

375
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,060
If you're not, then you're not.

376
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,500
If you are, then you say it.

377
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,820
Do you know that

378
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,220
you just asked me if I like to eat or not?

379
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,580
What did you just ask me?

380
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,740
I'm going to explode.

381
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,220
Me?

382
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,780
Yes.

383
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,660
Look at it seriously.

384
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,060
Do you think I'm the murderer?

385
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,580
Yes.

386
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,060
I'm starting to shake it here.

387
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,340
Then it's you, Zhang Linhe.

388
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,700
I think you've really grown up.

389
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,900
Because you took the murderer,

390
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,980
you dare to face me like this.

391
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,940
And you're actively provoking this confrontation.

392
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,340
Don't use this to confuse others.

393
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,220
Confuse who?

394
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,900
Just confuse everyone around you.

395
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,980
Who do you think will believe me?

396
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,420
I believe you.

397
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,100
I believe you.

398
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,900
You believe me?

399
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,980
You believe I'm not the murderer?

400
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,780
Who do you think is the murderer?

401
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,980
Then who do I think it is?

402
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
You're the real one.

403
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,820
You're going to lead us.

404
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,620
You're still there.

405
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,660
You're going to control me.

406
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,660
Who do you think is the murderer?

407
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,540
I can't tell at all.

408
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,100
To be honest.

409
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,820
You can't tell at all?

410
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,540
Yes, because I haven't figured it out yet.

411
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,260
I just wanted to think about it.

412
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,380
But I'm not sure.

413
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,060
I want to ask now.

414
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,820
Does X know who the murderer is?

415
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,420
I know.

416
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,220
You know?

417
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,620
Of course I know.

418
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,860
He knows who the murderer is

419
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,540
as soon as he's in X.

420
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,940
Of course I know.

421
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,020
Of course I know.

422
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,060
6.57, right?

423
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,060
6.58.

424
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,700
At this time, it's He He Ke, right?

425
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,780
Three minutes is not enough, right?

426
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,700
I want to ask.

427
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,940
I don't think it's enough either.

428
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,460
You just have to pass the bag for three minutes.

429
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,740
Then you kill him.

430
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,380
Where are you going to get him?

431
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,140
Then you have to pass the bag for three minutes.

432
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,620
You have to pass it for so long.

433
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,740
Then put it on the right track.

434
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
So if that's the case,

435
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,780
let's give up on what we just said.

436
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,580
That's to say, we can get rid of you two.

437
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,740
Give up on this idea.

438
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,340
Because it seems that everyone's time

439
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,900
is not so sufficient.

440
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,940
Yes.

441
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
It's not enough.

442
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,780
I found another thing.

443
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,660
What I found was just a greedy rat.

444
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,820
Or he's a bold man.

445
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,580
What he found was just

446
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,980
an unimportant thing.

447
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,220
But 8.5 found

448
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,060
my sister's bracelet.

449
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,140
And my sister was on the live broadcast before.

450
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,220
So he has this logic.

451
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,140
You found that

452
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,100
this is a huge live broadcast.

453
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,860
You're right.

454
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,900
Then you use this method to kill my sister.

455
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,580
I'll let you feel like

456
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,460
you're secretly changing your music today.

457
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
Yes.

458
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,460
When they were talking,

459
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,580
they were staring at each other.

460
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,900
Can you pay attention to that?

461
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,660
I'm staring at each other when I'm talking to someone.

462
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,140
No.

463
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,260
When he was talking to us,

464
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,900
they were staring at each other.

465
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,620
Can you pay attention to that?

466
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,660
But I don't think the murderer of X

467
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,140
is so obvious.

468
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,100
Because you didn't find it.

469
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,980
I'm looking at it.

470
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,260
Are you always following me?

471
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,060
As long as I'm talking to someone,

472
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,460
you won't feel comfortable.

473
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,100
That makes sense.

474
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,140
It's possible.

475
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,060
A sudden love story.

476
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,900
I can die in the street.

477
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,180
I don't need to wear a transmission belt.

478
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,620
I can change the background and take a picture.

479
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,500
And then I can use the video to recognize others.

480
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,380
You need to use the green screen.

481
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Or you need to use the same space

482
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,660
to take a picture.

483
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,420
We have green screens everywhere.

484
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,940
Isn't there a pile of green boxes

485
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,540
outside the door?

486
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,660
What do you mean?

487
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,020
You can kill in the door.

488
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,580
I found it.

489
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,300
Here.

490
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,180
Over there.

491
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,340
This place

492
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,420
means

493
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
we're smoking here.

494
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,340
We're smoking here.

495
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,300
If I'm the boss,

496
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,220
I'll pick the vegetables.

497
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,340
If Mr. Jin is the boss, I'll pick the vegetables.

498
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,820
Here.

499
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,060
I think

500
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,300
the most important thing is

501
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,380
that he needs to know

502
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
the environment we're in.

503
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,860
He is the only one

504
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,540
who knows our factory.

505
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,700
He's not a real factory worker.

506
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,220
You need to find out what we're doing.

507
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,340
I know this live broadcast company.

508
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,100
Live broadcast company.

509
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,380
And the green screen.

510
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,580
Maybe you all know about it.

511
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,820
Yes.

512
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,940
Green screen is also a very important thing.

513
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,500
Green screen is also a very important thing.

514
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
So he knows about this.

515
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,460
I really suspect him now.

516
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,980
I really suspect him.

517
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,060
Why?

518
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,460
I walked into the bathroom at 55 minutes in the morning.

519
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,780
I washed for about three minutes in there.

520
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
When I came out,

521
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,820
I met him in the corridor.

522
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,700
Where did he go?

523
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,900
I didn't see him.

524
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,860
No, there's another question.

525
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,220
You two haven't seen each other

526
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,620
for a while.

527
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,340
So he didn't go to the bathroom.

528
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,380
I can only say that I suspect him.

529
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,660
You said you saw him.

530
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,260
It happened to be at 57 minutes

531
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,340
when he was delivering food.

532
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,980
So he was stuck at the point

533
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,380
where you were delivering food.

534
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,700
After you were stuck at the point,

535
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,980
he went out right after that.

536
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,300
He went out to meet me.

537
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,820
That's right.

538
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,900
Then I saw him

539
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,980
when he came back to the room.

540
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,820
It was 7 o'clock.

541
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,940
I'm curious about one thing.

542
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,580
He didn't know where he was for 12 minutes.

543
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,340
He couldn't make sure

544
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,540
when I could make this chance encounter.

545
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,380
He had one thing he could make sure.

546
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,460
It was the time when Jin Tangshou was delivering food.

547
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,300
It was 6.57.

548
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,860
Jin Tangshou did see him.

549
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,740
Today, my brother did a great job for him.

550
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,660
Don't be fooled.

551
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,260
Don't be fooled.

552
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,220
I'm telling you,

553
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,060
you can think that I have a lot of money.

554
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,980
But they...

555
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,980
They have a lot more money than us.

556
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,540
Well,

557
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,220
I think there's no problem with his reasoning.

558
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,180
But don't ignore him at the same time, okay?

559
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,300
Or else,

560
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,220
it's not fair to choose him alone.

561
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,580
Why is it not fair?

562
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,380
What's not fair about this?

563
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,220
Others are also suspicious.

564
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Is he your biological son or something?

565
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,300
What's not fair about this?

566
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,700
Yes.

567
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,500
He's my ex.

568
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,020
He's my ex.

569
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,620
I have someone to choose.

570
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,340
Who do you want to vote for?

571
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,140
Who do you want to vote for?

572
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,300
The one between them.

573
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,980
He's not normal today.

574
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,020
Don't you think so?

575
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,420
Am I not normal?

576
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,020
A little bit.

577
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,620
Because he kept saying that I'm his ex.

578
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,940
I don't think good people would be so late.

579
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,380
Yes.

580
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,980
If I were him,

581
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,620
I would never say that I'm his ex.

582
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,780
You always keep silent.

583
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,420
But you're always...

584
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,700
You're always...

585
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,660
You keep silent.

586
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,940
But you're always...

587
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,740
The one I want to vote for is

588
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,220
Jin Tangshou.

589
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,860
Of course, I won't vote for myself.

590
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,260
So I think

591
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,700
he's the most suspicious.

592
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,380
Today,

593
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,380
my real choice is

594
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,620
Jin Tangshou.

595
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,220
I'll use

596
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,180
double voting rights.

597
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,980
I think

598
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,620
Jin Tangshou is

599
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,500
the mud-sweeping one.

600
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,220
8 points.

601
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,020
Jin Tangshou is the mud-sweeping one.

602
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,340
Six votes.

603
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,940
What does it mean?

604
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
One vote for each person.

605
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,740
One vote for each person.

606
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,260
You won.

607
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,660
I forgot.

608
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,340
This person has double votes.

609
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,860
He didn't use it.

610
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
Did you use it this time?

611
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,700
No.

612
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,980
You didn't use it in the first episode, did you?

613
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,620
I did.

614
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,060
Really?

615
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,020
I used it right after I came up.

616
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,100
When I got it,

617
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,300
I said I'd use it right after I came up.

618
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,140
I used it right after I came up.

619
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,620
I used it right after I came up.

620
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,580
I used it right after I came up.

621
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,620
Then you can only use two votes.

622
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,060
But you have to win.

623
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,660
Yes.

624
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
You have to keep it a secret.

625
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,180
Come on, this circle.

626
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,540
Everyone is going to grab it by the collar.

627
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,140
Grab.

628
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,740
Grab the key, right?

629
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,500
Grab the chair, but you have to turn it around.

630
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,700
This time, the key seems to be quite textured.

631
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
The key is here.

632
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,900
This time,

633
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
you lost.

634
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
You failed.

635
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
The real murderer is 8 points.

636
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,460
I think it's definitely her.

637
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,820
You just won't listen to me.

638
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,860
I'm not sure it's her.

639
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,820
It must be one of them.

640
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,660
You're too obvious.

641
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,580
She's already eliminated.

642
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,100
The two of them.

643
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,860
But she's...

644
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,700
What are you two looking at?

645
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,900
I'm looking at the thing with anyone.

646
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,140
Don't be because...

647
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,740
You two are looking at so many things.

648
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,100
She's talking to anyone.

649
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,980
I'm looking at her.

650
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,580
Yes.

651
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,300
No.

652
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,700
What are you two looking at?

653
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,820
Because she's hosting.

654
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,020
She's hosting this.

655
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,860
Can we tell her

656
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,900
if we're talking?

657
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,700
Then your eyes are so...

658
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,140
She's a detective.

659
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,100
I'm not looking at me either.

660
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,940
You didn't say a good word.

661
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
Do you know that?

662
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
Today's target is

663
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
her hiding place.

664
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,780
We suspect that she has less people.

665
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,300
That's right.

666
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,020
You'll find that in all the time zones,

667
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,460
only you have 7.10 points.

668
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,420
Come back to this point.

669
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,660
My motivation is the most unfavorable.

670
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,020
What's wrong?

671
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,660
You two...

672
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,740
You scared me.

673
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,740
This is the person.

674
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,140
This is the person who ran away.

675
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,060
The chain is broken.

676
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,660
It's embarrassing to laugh.

677
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,100
I thought you were scared.

678
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
I'm sorry.

679
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,780
I think the MVP of this episode

680
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,100
should be...

681
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,100
I think it's Liu Yuning.

682
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,580
Because she's

683
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,740
very serious about hosting this show.

684
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,660
So I finally ruled out

685
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,820
that she and Bai Yu

686
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,300
should be Bai Yu is the X.

687
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,860
And I finally decided that

688
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,500
8 is the murderer.

689
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,260
Then the last person to be killed is of course D.

690
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,220
I hope that

691
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
I can

692
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,700
reach the target

693
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,980
to Zhang Yunhe at the last moment.

694
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,420
I did very well.

695
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,220
I did very well.

696
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,380
I hope she can keep going.

697
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,820
Today's MVP is

698
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,860
Li Li Yubara.

699
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,900
During the whole process,

700
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,380
she acted too seriously.

701
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,500
I...

702
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
I suspected that she was the murderer.

703
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,620
But her whole state

704
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,660
was very vague during this process.

705
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,060
What does black painting mean?

706
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,180
How to black paint?

707
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,940
Because when I was observing everyone,

708
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,500
maybe even when I didn't see her,

709
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,900
she was also doing some

710
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
performances in this environment.

711
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,020
So when I

712
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,220
revealed this answer,

713
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,260
I found that

714
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,100
I forgot that

715
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,740
she is a very excellent actress.

716
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,060
I ignored this thing.

717
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,740
It's my problem.

718
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,060
So she acted very well today.

719
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,940
And the victory I got

720
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
is also very precious.

721
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,620
8.

722
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,260
I haven't seen any change

723
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,900
in so long.

724
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,660
And everyone is trying hard to make sense of it.

725
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,020
They are also trying to push it.

726
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,980
But still...

727
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,980
It's not as strong as I thought.

728
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,980
So I think it's a very successful MVP.

729
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,340
MVP is

730
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,580
for Bai Yu.

731
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,620
Because I...

732
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,220
I have been suspecting

733
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,700
Reba and Jingjing.

734
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,660
But Bai Yu has been helping me

735
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,980
to attack Jingjing.

736
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,260
He was mixing the listening.

737
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,860
It made me feel...

738
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,700
It made me feel that I was right.

739
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,620
And at the same time,

740
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,460
I ignored Reba's suspicion.

741
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,940
And her...

742
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,340
Her performance and Ning's performance

743
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,020
are very clear.

744
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,740
I think Ning is the X.

745
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,500
3rd season of the show.

746
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,340
The first episode.

747
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,740
The first episode of the show.

748
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
It's my turn.

749
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,140
I successfully escaped from

750
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,980
the murderer.

751
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,340
I got the golden key.

752
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,180
Why?

753
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,980
Because

754
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,220
I used my usual style.

755
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,340
I sat there and said...

756
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,340
It's so complicated. I don't understand.

757
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,780
Didn't the person yesterday

758
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,300
have something to do with today?

759
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,860
No.

760
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,300
But if it's

761
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,180
6.57 and 58,

762
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,180
then everyone can do it later.

763
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,220
What do you mean?

764
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,300
I don't understand at all.

765
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,340
What are you talking about?

766
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,860
I won this game.

767
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,940
Bye.

768
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,180
The show is on air every Friday.

769
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,620
Every Friday, the show will be on air.

770
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,020
The show will be called Behind the Scenes.

771
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,620
Every Saturday, the show will be on air.

772
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,820
There will be a little push-and-pull table.

773
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,620
There will be a little update.

774
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,780
There will be a meal.

775
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,260
Every Sunday, the show will be on air.

776
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,540
Watch the show.

777
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,140
Every Monday, the show will be on air.

778
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,580
Watch the show with the He Li Mo Jin

779
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,820
and the team of push-and-pull.

780
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,900
The light breaks the silence.

781
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
The darkness is in the mouth.

782
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,940
The sea winds up.

783
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,940
The soul is on the shore.

784
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,940
The more you search, the more you get.

785
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
The stars are in the sea.

786
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,260
The world is in danger.

787
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
Don't be afraid.

788
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
The soul is lost.

789
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
The dream is trapped.

790
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
The wind is blowing.

791
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
The earth is in the air.

792
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
The shadow is in the air.

793
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
The invisible wave is in the air.

794
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,260
The light breaks the silence.

795
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,260
The wind is in the air.

796
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,540
Let's start from the beginning.

797
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,540
Start from the beginning.

798
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,540
Let's start from the beginning.

799
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,860
Let's help each other.

800
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,860
The story is hard to read.

801
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,860
Start from the beginning.

802
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,860
Let's seek the truth.

803
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,860
Let's speak out the truth.

804
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,860
Come on, everyone.

805
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Start from the beginning.

806
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,060
Let's unlock the gates.

807
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Use courage to create new possibilities.

808
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,060
Let's continue the search.

809
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
Search for the password

810
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,060
And the evidence to talk

811
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Come on, everyone

812
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Let's start the game

813
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
Let's work together to save her

814
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
The game is over
