[My Special Girl]

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,950
[Episode 12]

4
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,990
Hello!

5
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,310
Why are you here?

6
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,590
These are his personal details.

7
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,270
Pick him up and come back.

8
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,480
Ai...

9
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,460
It's me.

10
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,820
The world is so small.

11
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,079
I didn't believe Yibai

12
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,870
is your aunt.

13
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,910
Right.

14
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,829
But my aunt

15
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,390
only has 20,000 followers.

16
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,470
How did it happen

17
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,430
that you were...

18
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,700
Fate.

19
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,650
Fate?

20
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,300
I didn't cheat.

21
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,630
Do you think my aunt will believe that?

22
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,300
Okay, okay.

23
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,579
I told you it's fate.

24
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,860
She has to believe it.

25
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,540
She will be angry.

26
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,980
Dan,

27
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,370
am I good to you?

28
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,090
Did I help you at work?

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,540
Then what would you do

30
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,820
if I needed help?

31
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,380
Jie,

32
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,950
if you could

33
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,540
speak more normally,

34
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,190
that would be great.

35
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,630
Okay.

36
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,340
Help me.

37
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,720
My aunt is very fierce.

38
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,650
It's a deal.

39
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,220
Gu told me

40
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,260
you resigned.

41
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,800
What happened?

42
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,900
Did he abuse you?

43
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,040
No.

44
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,910
Mr. Gu is pretty nice to me.

45
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,310
Then what was the reason?

46
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,620
I...

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,620
My family

48
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,310
still wants me to be a teacher.

49
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,280
Your family? No problem.

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,020
I'll work it out

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,530
with your aunt.

52
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,329
No, no thanks.

53
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,200
Which way is it?

54
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,440
Quick.

55
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,100
On the right. It's here.

56
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,820
Aunt Yibai.

57
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,700
Aibai.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,920
It's me.

59
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,110
Hello everyone.

60
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,660
I'm Yibai.

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,459
It's a pleasure

62
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,550
to meet you all here on this livestream.

63
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,620
We have a

64
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,899
very special livestream today.

65
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,180
We have invited

66
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,830
one lucky fan.

67
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,020
Let's welcome him.

68
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,420
Hello everyone.

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,600
My name is Han Yijie.

70
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,350
Today,

71
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,340
I'm with Yibai

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,110
and together we are Team Jiebai.

73
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,550
Nice to meet you.

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,630
Today,

75
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,900
our first dish

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
is claypot conch soup.

77
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,970
It's special due to the soup.

78
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,490
Let me get you a bowl.

79
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,740
Yibai,

80
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,040
which condiments would you use?

81
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,750
Personally,

82
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,220
I'll go with a little bit of pepper.

83
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,230
It's a good way to elevate the taste.

84
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,580
Okay.

85
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,760
Thank you, Yibai.

86
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,920
You're so nice.

87
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,920
Here's a heart.

88
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,100
Yibai spoils her fans.

89
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,500
Cheering for Team Jiebai.

90
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,200
I strongly request

91
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,060
that Team Jiebai feed each other.

92
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,670
The fan is so handsome.

93
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,530
He has couple vibes with Yibai.

94
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,410
Is it good?

95
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,660
-Of course.
-Okay, I’ll...

96
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,410
Wait.

97
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,470
I'll add some

98
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,740
other seasoning.

99
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,140
It'll taste better.

100
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,110
Open your mouth.

101
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,140
Actually,

102
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,500
Aunt Yibai and Jie are pretty compatible.

103
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,900
Tell everyone what it tastes like.

104
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,990
Is it good?

105
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,930
Yes.

106
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,900
Take a look.

107
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,900
The conch shells that we chose

108
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,909
are all

109
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,020
very large.

110
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,570
Now, let me show you

111
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,800
our second dish.

112
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,660
What is the second dish?

113
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
Let me introduce

114
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,520
our second dish.

115
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,200
Does it smell good?

116
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,500
Let me show you.

117
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,820
Our second dish

118
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,630
is wild eels

119
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,700
and pink tomatoes from New Zealand.

120
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,270
Let's invite our lucky fan

121
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,140
to have a taste.

122
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,460
You don't eat eel?

123
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,320
In that case, I'll try it

124
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,060
and tell you guys

125
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,190
what it tastes like.

126
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,080
You're not allowed to eat either.

127
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,780
I hope our friends in front of the screen

128
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,040
don't eat this either.

129
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,450
That's it for today's livestream.

130
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,140
Thank you.

131
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,420
Today's livestream

132
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,500
is not over yet.

133
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,940
Let me show you...

134
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,540
You're here to make a scene, right?

135
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,120
What do you want?

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,560
Jie.

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,659
-Our livestream was actually...
-Dan.

138
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,460
Take him away.

139
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,280
Let's go.

140
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,510
Go.

141
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,020
I'm very sorry.

142
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,950
We have a situation

143
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,650
for our

144
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,540
livestream today.

145
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,540
See you next time.

146
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,220
Bye.

147
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,070
Dan, wait.

148
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
I'll talk to your aunt alone.

149
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,110
Yibai.

150
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,060
I studied IT,

151
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,740
but I joined an NGO.

152
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,860
Do you know why?

153
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,060
When I was 16,

154
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,860
I followed my parents

155
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,659
to events held by the Oceanic Society.

156
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,659
They would attach sensors

157
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,659
to marine animals

158
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,700
to monitor

159
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,470
their vital signs

160
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,360
and activity.

161
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,250
For these two dolphins,

162
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,090
Lucy

163
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,460
and Jerry,

164
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,870
I attached

165
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,110
the sensors myself.

166
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,440
Every six months,

167
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,060
I collected information on them.

168
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,860
Do you know what happened later?

169
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,940
When I saw them again three years later,

170
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,420
they were already dead.

171
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,570
Do you know what the biologists

172
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,700
found when

173
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,060
they dissected them?

174
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,290
In its stomach,

175
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,640
there were 20 kilos of plastic waste.

176
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,320
20 kilograms.

177
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
For most people,

178
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,500
marine life

179
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,420
is just something to look at, to play with, to eat.

180
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,740
But to me,

181
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,630
they are my friends.

182
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,440
Hello, Mr. Liu.

183
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

184
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,340
I admire your courage.

185
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,810
Jie,

186
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,960
are you really courting Aunt Yibai?

187
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,030
Her livestream

188
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,590
was sponsored.

189
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,790
I'm afraid she's going to be charged.

190
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,110
If you see my aunt again,

191
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,970
you'd better walk the other way.

192
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,560
It's fine.

193
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,190
Strong women are afraid of persistent men.

194
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,040
Even if she's an Antarctic glacier,

195
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,660
I, Han Yijie, will melt her.

196
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,440
As for the compensation,

197
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,750
I'll pay for it.

198
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,360
Don't worry.

199
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,900
I knew you wouldn't be home on the weekend.

200
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,360
You had to be in the office.

201
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
I saw Hao Liang.

202
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,620
I asked her

203
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,210
why she resigned.

204
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,070
Guess what she said.

205
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,550
She said you don't like her.

206
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,610
You think she didn't do her job well.

207
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,620
So she took the blame and resigned.

208
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,040
You're really good at talking nonsense.

209
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm not talking nonsense.

210
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,190
I tried to persuade her.

211
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,660
But she

212
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,420
has been heartbroken by you.

213
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,080
She's made up her mind.

214
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,060
I didn't...

215
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,920
I believe you.

216
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,720
But Hao Liang doesn't.

217
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,190
I'll go find her.

218
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,150
Don't mention her in front of me again.

219
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,510
Gu Jiuli's mouth...

220
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,660
You liar.

221
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,090
I tried.

222
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,780
I went to see her,

223
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
tutored her

224
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,050
and bought her her idol's album.

225
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,580
And then?

226
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,550
Then she resigned.

227
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
If she resigned,

228
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,940
it means she doesn't like you anymore.

229
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,140
What else could it be?

230
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,600
Maybe she's just like you.

231
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,510
Everyone used to doubt you.

232
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,030
But she was the only one who supported you.

233
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,160
She racked her brains

234
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,490
to have dinner with you.

235
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,400
She even gave you a stress-relieving straw.

236
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,790
She did so much,

237
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,020
she did everything,

238
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,680
but she didn't receive any response.

239
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,310
So she was disappointed.

240
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,460
She left.

241
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,420
Mr. Gu, happy birthday.

242
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,830
May every day be a sunny day for you.

243
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,400
I wanted to treat you to dinner

244
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,270
as a thank you.

245
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,660
But I didn't know how to ask.

246
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,460
You said you were under a lot of pressure yesterday.

247
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm hoping it can help you relax.

248
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,250
She did so much

249
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,570
she did everything,

250
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,200
but she didn't receive any response.

251
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,700
So she was disappointed.

252
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,940
She left.

253
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,380
Did you

254
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,020
meet her today?

255
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,260
Who?

256
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,500
Her.

257
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,330
Who?

258
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,620
Make it clear.

259
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,740
Hao Liang.

260
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,940
Don't

261
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,380
Don't mention that name in front of me again.

262
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,100
Hao Liang?

263
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,460
This is the last time.

264
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:28,970
Didn't you

265
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
forbid me from mentioning her name?

266
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,270
How could you...

267
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,740
Why did you...

268
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,900
Tell me.

269
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,070
If you want to

270
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,610
be my relative in the future,

271
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,140
be polite,

272
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,980
okay?

273
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,890
I'd like to make a grand introduction.

274
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,370
I...

275
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,220
am your best friend

276
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,980
who grew up with you in diapers.

277
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,980
Besides that,

278
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,150
from today onwards,

279
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,790
I have a new identity.

280
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,710
Your future

281
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,390
uncle-in-law.

282
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,700
My new girlfriend

283
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
is Hao Liang's aunt.

284
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,430
Let's talk after you actually woo her.

285
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,520
How do you know that I haven't?

286
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,140
Li,

287
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,760
give me the most expensive liquor

288
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,420
that he's kept.

289
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
Let me celebrate.

290
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,980
Okay.

291
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,580
Look.

292
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,060
So handsome!

293
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,770
Who is he? So handsome.

294
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,020
I don't know.

295
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,540
Is he waiting for someone here?

296
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,100
Okay.

297
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,060
I got it.

298
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,910
I have to go.

299
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,460
Bye.

300
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,180
Mr. Gu.

301
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,960
Are you here for Hao Liang?

302
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,140
Zhu Yi.

303
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,110
Didn't you break up with her?

304
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,940
After thinking about it,

305
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,350
I still think Dan

306
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,710
is the best match for me.

307
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,430
So I'm gonna have to leave you in the lurch.

308
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,370
I-I-I...

309
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,300
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,190
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,140
I lied to you for Zhu Yi.

312
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,980
He cheated again and again

313
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,760
and you get back together again and again.

314
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,860
Do you like being cheated on that much?

315
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,470
I...

316
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,030
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,820
I don't mind.

318
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,900
You don't mind?

319
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,460
Don't tell me

320
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,970
you haven't fully gotten back together?

321
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,430
You can say that.

322
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,050
I...

323
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,440
I'm willing to give him space.

324
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,920
Senior, you misunderstood.

325
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,710
Why are you everywhere?

326
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,250
Don't take this the wrong way. We...

327
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,780
We...

328
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,190
I have something to ask you.

329
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,780
The handover was not done well.

330
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,859
I won't sign

331
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,589
your internship certificate.

332
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,900
It's okay, Dan.

333
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,359
It's just a piece of paper.

334
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,560
I can help you with it.

335
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,660
I...

336
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,290
I've already cleared everything with Mr. Fei.

337
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,730
Each person has a role.

338
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,380
You can leave if you want,

339
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,470
but find someone who can replace you.

340
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,470
I can, Mr. Gu.

341
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,339
I have time.

342
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,100
Yes.

343
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,540
She has the same major

344
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,250
as Dan.

345
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,660
She can do everything

346
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,540
that Dan can do.

347
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,610
Panpan is more suitable than me.

348
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,580
Are you sure?

349
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,670
Where are you going?

350
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,780
This is the last time I'm going to help you.

351
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,340
Dan.

352
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,060
What?

353
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,090
Let's talk.

354
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,920
About what?

355
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,880
You like Hao Liang?

356
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,520
No.

357
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,760
Your target is Hao Liang.

358
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,060
My target is Jiuli.

359
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,370
Let's work together

360
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,580
and help each other get the person they love.

361
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,460
What do you think?

362
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,940
What's so good about that man?

363
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,500
He is good.

364
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,270
I like him.

365
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,660
You don't get to criticize him.

366
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,620
Crazy.

367
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,380
Do you want to work together?

368
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,020
Tell me.

369
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,820
It's okay.

370
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,420
You're trying. You're on your way.

371
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,260
One day,

372
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,680
you're gonna shine.

373
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,530
Good morning, Mr. Gu.

374
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,980
C.

375
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,870
C!

376
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,700
Mr. Gu.

377
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,950
Have you finished

378
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,880
what I asked for?

379
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,420
Why?

380
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,260
How many days has it been?

381
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,660
You have to give it to me before you get off work.

382
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,650
I think Mr. Gu

383
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,750
is going through menopause.

384
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,610
And he's not been

385
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,810
in a good mood lately.

386
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,780
Really?

387
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,460
Yes.

388
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,110
Could it be...

389
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,210
that things are not going well...

390
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,340
with the investors?

391
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,230
The company is not

392
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,840
going bankrupt and getting liquidated, right?

393
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,060
Does the company's bankruptcy

394
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,840
have a causal link

395
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,590
with Mr. Gu's

396
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,750
mood?

397
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,540
We need to report this to Mr. Fei.

398
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,340
Yes.

399
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,340
I'll fill out the requisition form.

400
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,990
Guess

401
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,940
how much budget Mr. Gu will give us?

402
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,460
I'd better ask Ms. Hu.

403
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,540
No, I...

404
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,860
Master Ka, what's going on?

405
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,360
C!

406
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,270
These kids haven't given up yet.

407
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,730
20 million to 2 million.

408
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,990
And it's a one-time payment.

409
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,700
How is it?

410
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,340
Have you eaten?

411
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,230
No, I got kicked out.

412
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,260
Tell her.

413
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,020
Get her to eat.

414
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,150
How can she not eat?

415
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,130
Indeed.

416
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,370
What's wrong?

417
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,170
The paperwork's been rejected again.

418
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,410
There's been another logistical problem.

419
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,330
Yibai hasn't been home

420
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,190
for three days.

421
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,680
I just brought the food in

422
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,900
and she said she had no appetite so she wouldn't eat any of it.

423
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,140
That won't do.

424
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,400
Her body is going to fail

425
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,180
before the project is completed.

426
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,060
Look at you.

427
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,740
Give her the food.

428
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,970
Alright, let me do it.

429
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,000
Mr. Wang, I've already

430
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,980
explained to you that

431
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,500
the transportation of raw materials

432
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,380
is under our control.

433
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,240
I can't get them

434
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,880
to mass produce it for me.

435
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,180
Hello?

436
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,280
No matter how busy you are, eat something.

437
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,120
I've eaten.

438
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,550
Don't touch my stuff.

439
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,190
Eat. Be good.

440
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,820
I don't want to eat now.

441
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,680
I just want to

442
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,280
be alone for a while,

443
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,920
okay?

444
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,650
I'll handle the logistics.

445
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,380
Eat up.

446
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,340
Come with me after you're done.

447
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,830
Let's go.

448
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,670
[Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park]

449
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
The logistics...

450
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,020
What is the solution

451
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,010
you mentioned?

452
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,930
Time.

453
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,020
Challenges are like

454
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,410
psychopathic bastards.

455
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,870
The more you look uncomfortable,

456
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,130
the happier it will be.

457
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,330
It will try its best

458
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,350
to cause you trouble.

459
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,070
But if you

460
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,230
face it with a smile,

461
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,640
it will become a coward.

462
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,300
I thought

463
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,740
you're someone who knows your boundaries.

464
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,810
It turns out that being wilful and childish

465
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,960
is your nature.

466
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,070
You've said this many times.

467
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,290
Since you're here,

468
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,120
look around.

469
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,180
Let go.

470
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:17,960
I won't.

471
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,670
Let go!

472
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,470
Give me my bag.

473
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,940
Get it yourself.

474
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,580
I...

475
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,870
You...

476
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,800
You cut off my livestream.

477
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,680
I can understand

478
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,380
you're being an environmentalist.

479
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,130
You tampered with my thumbdrive.

480
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,120
I can also assume

481
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,480
that you didn't mean it.

482
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,510
But look at where we are now.

483
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,940
The institute is in danger.

484
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,030
What are you doing?

485
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,360
You brought me here to see jellyfish?

486
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,370
Are you crazy, Han Yijie?

487
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,630
You think things aren't messy enough for me

488
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,140
right now?

489
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,580
Are you trying to kill me?

490
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,030
What are you doing?

491
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,310
Do you feel better now?

492
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,760
Don't hold everything in.

493
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,050
Relax.

494
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,760
You provoked me on purpose.

495
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,630
It hurts so much.

496
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,100
I've never had someone

497
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,920
hit me so hard.

498
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,730
Aren't you going to rub it better?

499
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,140
If you feel better,

500
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,240
let's leave.

501
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,900
I'll take you home.

we can try

Whoever goes will be scolded.

548
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,740
If you don't go, who will?

549
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,290
Let's go.

550
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,280
I can't go.

551
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,420
I really can't.

552
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,860
What's wrong? What are you doing?

553
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,580
Jie. Jie!

554
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,120
Come on.

555
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,300
Jie, come with us.

556
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,380
Wait.

557
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,860
What for?

558
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,480
We want Mr. Gu to approve two million

559
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,280
for the Infinity Team's Expert.

560
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,260
Can Mr. Gu approve it?

561
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,890
Of course.

562
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,460
We don't have time.

563
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,800
Trust Mr. Gu.

564
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,750
If he says yes, it'll work.

565
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,710
Alright, bye.

566
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,100
-Don’t go.
-It has to work.

567
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,940
Didn't you notice that Mr. Gu

568
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,970
has been in a bad mood recently?

569
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,030
Don't you know why?

570
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,500
Yes.

571
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,540
Mr. Gu can't solve the engine problem.

572
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,400
So he's grumpy.

573
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,500
Let's ask for the money together.

574
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,300
Wait.

575
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,800
Listen to me.

576
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,930
You're pinching me!

577
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,620
Jie.

578
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,060
Jie has something to ask.

579
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,510
Two million for Non Human.

580
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,550
Dream on.

581
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,290
In 2 days,

582
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,970
the VC will be holding

583
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,210
the second round of inspection.

584
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:30,900
But now...

585
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,860
Don't worry about it.

586
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,820
I'll take care of it.

587
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,460
But Boss,

588
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,940
in our case, we have to...

589
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,490
Get out.

590
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,460
You stay, Han Yijie.

591
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,820
Mr. Gu, just two million.

592
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,730
Two million can change the world.

593
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,370
And we've done the math.

594
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,280
The screenshot algorithm

595
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,440
is really better.

596
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,260
Alright.

597
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,230
Get out.

598
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,310
Let's go.

599
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:55,970
Are you done?

600
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,660
Just two million.

601
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,730
Am I cheating you?

602
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,120
You dug the hole yourself.

603
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Fill it yourself.

604
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,560
I didn't dig this hole.

605
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,840
You dug it yourself.

606
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,420
If you weren't dumped...

607
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,760
It's because Hao Liang's resignation

608
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
made you unhappy,

609
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,940
causing you to vent your anger on them,

610
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,750
making them think

611
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,990
you were unhappy with the research roadblocks...

612
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,630
I wasn't.

613
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,300
I know. I know.

614
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,260
I wasn't dumped.

615
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,870
It's because Hao Liang is ignorant.

616
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,540
You're just going to let her go?

617
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,040
After Xiaojiu's case is over,

618
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,060
I'll go find her.

619
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,030
Okay, good luck.

620
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,170
We were brothers in the first half of our lives.

621
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,370
We'll be relatives for the second half.

622
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,380
Take care of the people outside.

623
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,920
Give me a solution.

624
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,460
What do I tell them?

625
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,300
Suit yourself.

626
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,620
Don't let them

627
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,750
bother me with this.

628
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
How is it?

629
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,870
How did it go?

630
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,620
You still have to

631
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,380
trust Mr. Gu.

632
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,580
Believe that

633
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,170
he can solve it.

634
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,100
If you pester him now,

635
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,780
he won't have time to do his math,

636
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,640
and that would be worse for the VC.

637
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,390
At this point,

638
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,350
you're still covering for Mr. Gu.

639
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,740
This is not love, it's harm.

640
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,980
The best way

641
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,130
to solve the problem

642
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,330
is to ask Expert for help.

643
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,980
There's no other way.

644
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,120
Expert...

645
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,580
We just need money, right?

646
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,190
If we really need to,

647
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,360
let's go out to collect debts.

648
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,690
Yes.

649
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,500
Okay, that's right.

650
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,260
It's not about money.

651
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,610
Come back! Come back!

652
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,920
Come here.

653
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,130
What are you doing?

654
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,220
Mr. Gu

655
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,140
is Infinity Team's Expert.

656
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,090
He didn't want me to tell you.

657
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
But I think

658
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,230
it's necessary to reassure you now.

659
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,060
He's Infinity Team's Expert.

660
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,730
Really?

661
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,200
You don't believe me?

662
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,660
The two million email

663
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,390
that Expert replied

664
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,390
was written by me.

665
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,430
I've verified the IP address.

666
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,660
It's not in China.

667
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,210
That's because I pretended well.

668
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,610
Do you think we're fools?

669
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,220
If Mr. Gu is Expert,

670
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,060
why hasn't he

671
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,090
solved the engine problem?

672
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,740
Because he...

673
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,240
He is confident, he's already...

674
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,890
Jie,

675
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,800
I trust you.

676
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,780
Mr. Fei is wise.

677
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,960
C, you have to believe...

678
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,600
Master Ka.

679
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,820
If I write an email

680
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,070
and ask for one million...

681
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,600
Mr. Chen.

682
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,550
Do you think one million is appropriate?

683
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,900
Why don’t you believe me?

684
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:45,900
Mr. Fei,

685
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,420
you trust me, right?

686
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,180
I understand you.

687
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,570
Love is blind.

688
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,830
I think two million

689
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,530
is too high.

690
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,640
1.2 million is the best.

691
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,670
1.2 million then.

692
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,640
I don't think it's the same as Mr. Gu...

693
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,110
You don't believe me?

694
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,700
Please help me.

695
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,180
I'll give it to you when the money comes back.

696
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,940
I'm looking for my mom.

697
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,410
She doesn't have it.

698
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,980
Pressure Straw.

699
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,800
In this straw,

700
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,280
there are multivitamins.

701
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,250
You said you were under a lot of pressure yesterday.

702
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,180
I'm hoping it can help you relax.

703
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,150
Mr. Gu.

704
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,500
Calm down, everyone.

705
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,640
Boss is not here.

706
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,420
Excuse me.

707
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,780
Excuse me.

708
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:02,540
Excuse me.

709
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,650
Please register.

710
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,820
Excuse me.

711
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,280
I'll contact you

712
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,660
when Boss comes back.

713
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm sorry.

714
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,139
Excuse me.

715
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,780
Excuse me.

716
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,420
Hurry up.

717
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
I'll give it to my boss.

718
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:11,980
What happened?

719
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,719
When I came here this morning,

720
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,960
the company's phone was blowing up.

721
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,199
They're all from private equity and venture capital firms.

722
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,980
And these people at the entrance...

723
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,310
They're all investors.

724
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,500
They are all here

725
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,449
to give us money.

726
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,239
You can't even drive them away.

727
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,100
What about Mr. Gu?

728
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,920
I'm blowing up his phone. No one's answering.

729
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,860
Hello President Ma.

730
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,300
Excuse me.

731
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,730
President Ma, why are you here?

732
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,610
Hurry up.

733
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,900
Hurry up. Make way.

734
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,370
President Ma is here.

735
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,489
Hello, Mr. Ma.

736
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,260
Don't push.

737
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Come here! Hurry!

738
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,960
Han Yijie is calling.

739
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,670
Answer or hang up?

740
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,140
Hello? What is it?

741
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,480
Where are you, boss?

742
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,820
President Ma is here at Jiuqian in person.

743
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,750
President Ma? Which President Ma?

744
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,740
Ma Botao.

745
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,880
CEO of Yisheng Capital.

746
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,680
Our investor.

747
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,690
Do you know how many companies

748
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,700
can get Ma Botao

749
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,860
to come down personally?

750
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,290
This time,

751
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,280
we can't afford to slip up.

752
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,250
Hurry.

753
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,020
I'm going down to the basement.

754
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
Let's talk later.

755
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,490
He's here.

756
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,910
Hello, Mr. Gu.

757
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,780
I've been waiting for you all morning.

758
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,820
I'm the director of Yuandong Investment.

759
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,300
Mr. Gu.

760
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,450
This is my name card.

761
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,500
If I knew you were

762
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,360
the genius of Infinity Team,

763
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,530
we would've visited way earlier.

764
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,010
Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu.

765
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,110
I'm a manager at Mingyuan.

766
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,980
Please give me five minutes.

767
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,950
One minute is fine too.

768
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,820
Mr. Gu, wait a minute.

769
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,740
Mr. Gu.

770
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,960
As long as you sign the contract,

771
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,080
you can take this box with you immediately.

772
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,450
Mr. Gu,

773
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,710
it's inconvenient for you to take this box of money.

774
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,140
I...

775
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,370
Mr. Gu, I believe we have...

776
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:55,900
Mr. Gu...

777
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,140
As long as you sign the contract, it will be in effect immediately.

778
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,010
Don't you want to think about it?

779
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,540
Mr. Gu.

780
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,380
Mr. Gu.

781
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,500
I didn't expect that

782
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,620
Mr. Gu

783
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,540
is the globally famous

784
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,490
youth prodigy, Infinity Team.

785
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,120
I-I-Infinity Team?

786
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,960
Infinity Team? Did I hear it right?

787
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,300
And Mr. Han too.

788
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,460
President Ma, you're too polite.

789
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:23,980
Mr. Gu,

790
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,460
the night

791
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,040
we received the hard drive you sent for testing,

792
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,640
the foreign evaluation team

793
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,700
called me

794
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,760
from overseas

795
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,950
to ask me how I found out about

796
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,650
the engine of

797
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,730
Non Human.

798
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,360
Non Human.

799
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,230
Is Mr. Gu Expert?

800
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,300
Friends.

801
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,220
With the support of Non-Human,

802
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,030
our company

803
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,300
is full of confidence

804
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,750
for Xiaojiu's development.

805
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,630
So,

806
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,810
President Ma is here because...

807
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,260
Yisheng Capital

808
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
is going to double our investment in Jiuqian.

809
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,630
Two hundred million

810
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
will be paid in three installments.

811
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,120
The first issue,

812
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,300
100 million,

813
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,810
will be transferred to Jiuqian

814
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,460
on the second day of the contract.

815
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,400
What's the condition?

816
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,150
60% of shares after the launch.

817
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,520
30%.

818
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:13,960
Gu.

819
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,620
Xiaojiu is my work.

820
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,700
I can't give it to others.

821
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,720
Mr. Gu, you worry too much.

822
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,780
The company's decision-making powers

823
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,380
still lies in your hands.

824
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,660
What we want is dividends.

825
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,680
Once capital gets involved,

826
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,540
things will be profit-oriented.

827
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,290
Once they have control,

828
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,460
how can they not interfere?

829
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,180
Mr. Gu,

830
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,610
I know,

831
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,220
just outside this door,

832
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,510
there are many

833
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,070
VCs waiting to see you.

834
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,980
But

835
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,770
I think you must know

836
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,300
that they won't

837
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,280
show my level of sincerity.

838
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,860
If Jiuqian wants to develop and grow,

839
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,540
investors

840
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,820
like them

841
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,330
can't support you.

842
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,850
Besides,

843
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,260
their conditions

844
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,180
won't be better than what I gave you.

845
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,860
As you all know,

846
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,180
those in capital

847
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,150
are scheming

848
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,110
and resourceful.

849
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,420
Don't play the eagle when you see a rabbit.

850
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,210
Mr. Gu.

851
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:34,980
Mr. Gu.

852
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,860
There're funds from an unclear source

853
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,960
in the company's account.

854
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,090
There's 10 million.

855
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:39,980
Is someone

856
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,440
using us to launder money?

857
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,200
Should we call the police?

858
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,920
Why is there so much money all of a sudden?

859
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,340
Hello, Mr. Gu.

860
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,310
We're from Huaqiang Fund.

861
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,030
We are very sincere.

862
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,770
We can talk about anything.

863
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,230
We just transferred

864
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,160
10 million

865
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,070
to show our sincerity.

866
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,680
When do you think

867
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,180
we can

868
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,970
talk?

869
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,680
Okay.

870
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,070
In that case,

871
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,430
let's make an appointment.

872
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,690
Okay.

873
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,050
President Ma.

874
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,980
Both of us

875
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,780
should think about it.

876
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,940
Mr. Gu.

877
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,870
One billion.

878
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,780
Divided into five years.

879
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,190
30%.

880
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,620
Okay?

881
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,980
Any less

882
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,040
and we don't need to talk anymore.
