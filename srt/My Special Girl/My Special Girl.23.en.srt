[Episode 23]

4
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,329
I...

5
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,230
I think I messed up the cake.

6
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,230
Chiffon cake

7
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,570
is a

8
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,190
cake that you can't screw up.

9
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,760
Even if you screw up your life,

10
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,960
you won't screw up

11
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,850
a chiffon cake.

12
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,070
Maybe

13
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,829
it'll be better after you open it.

14
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,820
Let me help you.

15
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,540
Do you want to cut it off?

16
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,110
I can't do anything right.

17
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,610
It's so ugly. Don't take a picture.

18
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,600
It's...

19
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,050
It's so ugly. What's there to see?

20
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,870
Don't post it.

21
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,460
Besides this,

22
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,030
I also received

23
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,490
an even better gift today.

24
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,350
The real you.

25
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,690
Now,

26
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,170
you are both Hao Liang

27
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,160
and Dai.

28
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,940
You're not afraid of me

29
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,610
and you don't hide from me.

30
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,390
I'm very happy

31
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,250
I got to see this side of you today.

32
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,930
Let's try again?

33
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,790
Let's add some cream.

34
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,590
Okay. Here.

35
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,159
Long time no see.

36
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,070
Come in, please.

37
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,470
Including pre-planning...

38
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,150
We have lots of equipment inside.

39
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,390
You can have a look.

40
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,540
Welcome.

41
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,570
As for the funding,

42
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,470
there's no problem.

43
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,950
Yes, after all, our ultimate goal

44
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,909
is to make this project

45
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,170
a success.

46
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,920
It is indeed

47
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,930
-a good thing for the country and the people.
-Yijie.

49
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,510
Long time no see.

50
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,950
Yibai.

51
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,190
Come here.

52
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,590
Okay.

53
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,040
Come.

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,400
The initiation ceremony starts now.

55
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,200
Come.

56
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,750
Mr. Gong.

57
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,500
You did a great thing this time.

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,440
This project was successful

59
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,170
thanks to everyone's efforts.

60
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,990
Yibai.

61
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,360
You deserve the most credit

62
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,990
for the success of this project.

63
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,070
You're too kind, Mr. Gong.

64
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,330
Everyone worked hard.

65
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,080
But as the saying goes,

66
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,010
get married and establish your career.

67
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,620
You can't just focus on your career

68
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,380
and forget about marriage.

69
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,110
That's right.

70
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,909
See.

71
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,140
Even Mr. Han agrees with me.

72
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,560
Your mom called me

73
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
last night

74
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,730
asking me to introduce people to you.

75
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,600
Yesterday,

76
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
my wife

77
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,140
took a look at all

78
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:05,860
the marriageable young men around.

79
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,920
We really found one. He's right here.

80
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,750
Yongkang.

81
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,000
Yongkang, come here.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,530
Mr. Gong.

83
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,550
What's up?

84
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,510
Are you still single?

85
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,060
Our Yibai,

86
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,430
as you know very well,

87
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,830
is really outstanding.

88
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,930
My wife already

89
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,190
bought the movie tickets.

90
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,350
If you're free this afternoon,

91
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,810
go watch a movie together.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Here, take it.

93
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,420
No, Mr. Gong.

94
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,470
I already have a girlfriend.

95
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,040
What?

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,470
I...

97
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,810
made a bad match.

98
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,880
I'll get back to work then.

99
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,409
Look.

100
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,409
Mr. Gong.

101
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,530
I'm not bad either.

102
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,400
Right, there's Mr. Han too.

103
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,170
Mr. Han,

104
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,940
you certainly contributed

105
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,690
to the success of this project.

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,730
Thank you very much.

107
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,520
Thank you.

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,500
No, no.

109
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,090
Thank you very much.

110
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,530
No.

111
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,850
Well, Yibai.

112
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,440
It seems that

113
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm more anxious than your mom.

114
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,380
But don't worry.

115
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,680
You can

116
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,250
count on me for this.

117
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,670
Mr. Gong, Professor Wang is here.

118
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
I'm going.

119
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,230
Take this.

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

121
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,520
Okay. Talk later.

122
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Mr. Gong, actually, I...

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,250
Thank you again. Thank you very much.

124
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,690
Thank you. Alright.

125
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,290
Nice movie tickets from Mr. Gong.

126
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,220
Come on, let's go catch a movie.

127
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,060
Oh, so you were planning

128
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,490
to watch the movie with me?

129
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,330
Thank you.

130
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,970
When will you tell Mr. Gong

131
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,140
that I'm your boyfriend?

132
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,960
If you don't tell him,

133
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,800
next time

134
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,570
when he introduces boyfriends to you again,

135
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,770
I won't be able to stop myself.

136
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,630
Luckily it's Yongkang this time.

137
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,490
Silly.

138
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,480
When you've survived

139
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,930
my seasonal dumping curse,

140
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,730
we'll see.

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,270
You're so noisy.

142
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,370
I'm noisy?

143
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,970
If you think I'm noisy,

144
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,100
why don't you go out?

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,500
It's such a good day.

146
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,240
Why are you staying at home

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,110
instead of going on a date?

148
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,440
This is my house, right?

149
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,559
Don't tell me

150
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,080
your love was stolen by her fans?

151
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,049
You're so green with envy

152
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,090
that you're turning yellow.

153
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,000
You're so free

154
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,690
because you're also in the same situation?

155
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
Why would I be yellow?

156
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,380
I'm about to witness

157
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,540
my highlight.

158
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,320
If you have a good attitude,

159
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,400
I can invite you

160
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,600
to witness my big day.

161
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,490
I'll show you

162
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,350
what dating actually looks like.

163
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,180
This one doesn't work either.

164
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,470
We have evidence

165
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,600
of the boy cheating.

166
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,450
You must be mistaken.

167
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,050
It's legit.

168
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,480
Dafei has been following him.

169
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
He watched a movie

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,310
with another woman

171
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,640
and they fed each other.

172
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,910
I got

173
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,000
the address of their date location.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,130
I'm going there now.

175
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,290
I have to catch him in the act today.

176
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,000
What's wrong?

177
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,650
What's going on?

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,660
Did you really get cheated on?

179
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,910
Are you coming?

180
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,790
No, I have an appointment.

181
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,610
Okay.

182
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,050
What a pity.

183
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,330
I'm in a hurry. I'm leaving.

184
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,660
Help me pack my clothes.

185
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,890
The door is open.

186
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,790
The door is closed.

187
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,650
You're tall so you'll have a good view.

188
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,770
You're responsible for taking photos.

189
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,970
Everyone, the target

190
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,380
is the carousel.

191
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,010
Follow my plan

192
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,830
and do the ambush.

193
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,380
Got it?

194
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,130
Okay.

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,860
Dismissed.

196
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,260
Go.

197
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,660
Gu Jiuli.

198
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,930
Why are you here?

199
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,230
I was going to ask you.

200
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,870
Didn't you have something urgent to do?

201
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,820
Why are you here?

202
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,920
Didn't you have something important to do?

203
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,880
Why are you here?

204
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,240
Since you've busted me,

205
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,570
I'll be honest with you.

206
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,850
What else could I be doing here?

207
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,910
Obviously, I'm here with Chen Yibai.

208
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,770
I plan to propose to Chen Yibai.

209
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,360
Romantic carousel, sweet hand-holding.

210
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,690
Plant the happiest memories

211
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,170
in the happiest place.

212
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,360
Good one.

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,460
Did you come with my niece?

214
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,340
Where is she?

215
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,260
She's not here.

216
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,650
Okay, I'll take my leave. I have something urgent to do.

217
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,800
You didn't

218
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,560
come here to take photos for me, did you?

219
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,000
Are you that kind?

220
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,770
You're thinking too much.

221
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:15,960
Wait.

222
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,300
My niece is not here.

223
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,280
You're here alone

224
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,080
with a camera.

225
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,770
Gu.

226
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,850
Are you cheating on her?

227
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,370
Are you sure Chen Yibai

228
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,450
is interested in what's in your head?

229
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,840
Why am I wasting my time on this old virgin

230
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,850
with prosopagnosia?

231
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,380
The ice cream's all melted.

232
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,330
I'm leaving.

233
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,410
Owen.

234
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,410
Target spotted.

235
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,470
It's the man

236
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,620
who just walked you.

237
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,230
He's holding two ice cream cones.

238
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,710
Hello?

239
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,130
Hello.

240
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
Where are you?

241
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,970
At a restaurant on Gumei Road.

242
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm in line for Jie.

243
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,310
Gumei Road.

244
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,280
It's not far from the amusement park.

245
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,080
How about this?

246
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,920
Come find me at the carousel

247
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,090
in the amusement park.

248
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,240
Come as Dai.

249
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,860
I'm not letting go.

250
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,480
Are you going to keep holding it?

251
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
Sorry everyone.

252
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,560
We're going to check the equipment.

253
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,960
Please wait patiently.

254
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,360
Yibai.

255
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,570
It's 2 p.m.

256
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,170
Since we met,

257
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,690
it's been 89 days,

258
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,290
23 hours,

259
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,950
59 minutes

260
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,920
and 41 seconds.

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,180
In other words,

262
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,400
in 19 seconds,

263
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,430
it'll be 90 days

264
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,510
since we first met.

265
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,540
It's also when your seasonal dumping curse

266
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
comes into force.

267
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,050
Marry me.

268
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,040
I'll protect you from now on.

269
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,610
Let's break this curse together.

270
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,280
Scum!

271
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,690
Stop pretending.

272
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,150
Scum.

273
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,040
Stop pretending.

274
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,880
Scum!

275
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,650
Yes.

276
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,010
Hurry up, get over here.

277
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,010
You're a two-timer, you scumbag.

278
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,800
Disgusting.

279
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,710
Yes, disgusting.

280
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,710
-Listen to me.
-Scum.

281
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,590
Listen to me.

282
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,450
I’m Dai’s boyfriend.

283
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,900
What did you say?

284
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,410
Shut up!

285
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,130
Dai!

286
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,990
Dai!

287
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,880
Dai!

288
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,520
Dai!

289
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,490
We found the boy.

290
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,730
Dai! Dai!

291
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,560
You came at the right time.

292
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,310
Let me show you...

293
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,370
He is my boyfriend.

294
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,970
What's going on?

295
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,490
It's him?

296
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,720
What's going on?

297
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,730
How could this be?

298
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,180
This...

299
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,820
This...

300
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,320
You...

301
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,930
Everyone.

302
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,760
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,560
We're having some problems

304
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,690
with our equipment.

305
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,300
Please

306
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,080
evacuate in an orderly manner.

307
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,940
Okay, let's go.

308
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:17,710
Come on.

309
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,310
Everyone, evacuate in an orderly manner.

310
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,840
Take care of your children.

311
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,070
Did you

312
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,570
break the system

313
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,260
when you hacked the carousel?

314
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,300
I didn't.

315
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,350
You said you hacked it?

316
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,480
I lied to you.

317
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,720
But

318
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,080
I've already told the staff

319
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,560
that you did it.

320
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,450
What?

321
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,380
[Forest World Monitoring Center]

322
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm fixing it.

323
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,920
Don't worry.

324
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,350
Can you do it? Are you done?

325
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,360
Right away.

326
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,370
Listen.

327
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,620
You're in big trouble today.

328
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,810
If you still can't fix it,

329
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,070
we'll call the police.

330
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,310
I didn't do it.

331
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,170
Enough. Stop talking.

332
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,790
Hurry up.

333
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,270
I...

334
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,080
How do I fix this?

335
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,780
Move aside.

336
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,150
Don't disturb me.

337
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,030
Get up,

338
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,010
okay?

339
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,520
Can you do it?

340
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,150
Done.

341
00:15:59,170 --> 00:15:59,570
Great.

342
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,170
Thank you.

343
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,880
Thank you.

344
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,560
The equipment is working now.

345
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,370
When did you

346
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,750
prepare this ring?

347
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,490
Do you like it?

348
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,330
Yes.

349
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,630
-Aunt Yibai.
-I’m glad you like it.

350
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,530
Sorry.

351
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,660
Congratulations.

352
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,720
Thank you, Dan

353
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,850
for lining up for us.

354
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,570
I did it for Aunt Yibai.

355
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,170
Don't do this again.

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,760
Don't ask Dan to do things for you again.

357
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,250
Fine.

358
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,640
I won't.

359
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,980
Congratulations, guys.

360
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,860
Are you jealous?

361
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,630
If you are,

362
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,600
ask the old man next to you

363
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
to buy one for you.

364
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,700
Wait.

365
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
Gu Jiuli,

366
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,310
in the afternoon, Dan said that

367
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,290
you two are together.

368
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,359
As her family, I haven't agreed yet.

369
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,130
My niece is only 21 years old.

370
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,290
Shouldn't she

371
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,790
focus on her career first?

372
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,410
It's a stopgap measure.

373
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,960
Don't we have to

374
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,829
get your permission first?

375
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:19,930
How would I know

376
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,920
if he's sincere about you?

377
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,250
I'll prove it to you now.

378
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,980
What are you doing?

379
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,090
Don't look at me.

380
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,550
Why are you looking at your uncle?

381
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,240
Anything that Yibai says

382
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,740
is right.

383
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,860
Put down the knife.

384
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,890
How can you hold a knife

385
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,770
at your uncle?

386
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,040
If you have time,

387
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,940
please spare a thought for Dan.

388
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,460
Settle down

389
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,280
with my niece.

390
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,290
Jiuli.

391
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,010
Dan is about to graduate.

392
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,090
She did so well

393
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,030
at Jiuqian.

394
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,520
Shouldn't we

395
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,340
give her a better position?

396
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,840
Say something.

397
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,940
Jiuqian can't keep me.

398
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,390
I'm Qixiu's top streamer,

399
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,670
Dai.

400
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,640
It's okay.

401
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,560
No matter what you do,

402
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,110
I will support you.

403
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,490
Well,

404
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,310
you can start by helping me

405
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,510
move tomorrow.

406
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,200
No problem.

407
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,250
I'm almost done here.

408
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,840
Are you done packing?

409
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,660
[3547 steps today]

410
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,880
Not all efforts

411
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,890
reap rewards.

412
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,110
You're not a professional.

413
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,830
No matter how hard you train,

414
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,750
it's useless.

415
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,750
Give up sooner.

416
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,750
It's better for everyone.

417
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,450
It's not a singing competition.

418
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,730
What's with the high notes?

419
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,410
I can't sacrifice

420
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,450
the overall stage

421
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,270
for someone's strengths, can I?

422
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,760
It's already been approved in the meeting.

423
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,890
It can't be changed.

424
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,690
Why I started.

425
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,030
I've decided to

426
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,550
withdraw from the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

427
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,390
Hello?

428
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,960
Where are you?

429
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,650
I'm not done packing.

430
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
I was having a graduation gathering

431
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,170
and a classmate left first.

432
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,370
I was sending her off.

433
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,400
It's too noisy. I didn't hear the phone.

434
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,410
Where are you?

435
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,440
I'm behind you.

436
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,090
The gathering ended early.

437
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,590
I had nowhere to go

438
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,170
so I came to the field.

439
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,130
I ate too much

440
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,010
so I'm digesting the food.

441
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,980
I've gained weight in the past few months.

442
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,640
Why are you looking at me?

443
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,730
Don't worry.

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,290
I'll be able to eat

445
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,460
with you later.

446
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,960
If you can't bear to leave,

447
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,640
go back.

448
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,420
What are you talking about?

449
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,760
Isn't this what it's like after graduation?

450
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,330
Everyone goes their separate ways.

451
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,250
What can I do?

452
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,500
Can I ask her

453
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,440
not to leave?

454
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,470
You've just announced your withdrawal verbally.

455
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,090
The final program for the show

456
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,290
is not confirmed yet.

457
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,360
The personal opinions

458
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,560
of the stage director

459
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,060
doesn't represent Qixiu.

460
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,190
And Qixiu definitely

461
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,630
wants you to go.

462
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,110
After all, you

463
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,720
cultivated your own following

464
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
as a KOL.

465
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,930
I know.

466
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,390
But there's no need...

467
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,340
No need to go back.

468
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
The rules are the rules.

469
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,670
Unreasonable rules

470
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,760
can be resolved

471
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,160
through communication.

472
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,350
Besides,

473
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,770
I'm one of the sponsors.

474
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,000
I can help you

475
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,490
make some suggestions

476
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,440
without undermining fairness.

477
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,920
That's not the problem.

478
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,960
What's the problem then?

479
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,650
The problem is,

480
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,950
no matter how the rules change,

481
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,590
I don't want to

482
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,720
take part in the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

483
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,000
I can see that

484
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,770
you really like the stage

485
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,320
and you have a chance to get on it.

486
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,540
Why don't you give it a try?

487
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,770
Because I can't do it.

488
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Hao Liang.

489
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,170
I'm confused.

490
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,650
Why do you always think

491
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,570
you can't do it?

492
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,150
Because I can't.

493
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,900
Because I'll mess it up.

494
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,160
Because I'll hold Cute Mengmeng back.

495
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,490
How's that for a reason?

496
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,150
But you haven't even tried.

497
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,930
You've been working hard.

498
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,730
You've overcome your physical weakness.

499
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,330
You've made great progress.

500
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,580
So what if I've made progress?

501
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,240
I work my ass off

502
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,010
just to get to

503
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,640
where you people

504
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
start off.

505
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,710
You've always wondered

506
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,950
why some people

507
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,900
only get 69 points for Higher Mathematics

508
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,730
and don't get more than 36 points for the general assessment.

509
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,840
Since I was a kid,

510
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,000
I've been mediocre.

511
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,890
You're telling me to try.

512
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,840
Do you think

513
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,040
I've never tried?

514
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,770
I know better than anyone

515
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,360
how it feels to try

516
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,690
and not get any results.

517
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Whether it's exams or running,

518
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,140
I can't even meet half of

519
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,500
my mom's requirements.

520
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,440
I can only sing.

521
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,740
I only like singing.

522
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,090
It's the only

523
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
saving grace I have to prove myself.

524
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,290
If it's gone too,

525
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,320
I really don't know

526
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,360
what I'd do.

527
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,790
You're telling me to try.

528
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,450
But I really don't want to try.

529
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,810
I'm really afraid

530
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,010
I'll ruin the stage.

531
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,520
Then I'll lose everything.

532
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,740
Dan, you're back.

533
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,450
Dan, I'm leaving.

534
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,610
Take care.

535
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,570
Aren't you going to ask me

536
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,680
where I'm going?

537
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,920
Where are you going?

538
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,080
I'm going to Beijing.

539
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,920
It's far away.

540
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,830
Have a safe trip.

541
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,170
I...

542
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,520
Dan.

543
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,050
I'm leaving.

544
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,150
Turn around and look.

545
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,340
I've packed my luggage.

546
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,470
I'm leaving.

547
00:25:59,500 --> 00:25:59,910
I'm...

548
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,300
leaving.

549
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,840
Good luck with your work.

550
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,550
Thank you.

551
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,030
I'm leaving.

552
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,580
Don't you want to share this information

553
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,620
with others?

554
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,010
With who?

555
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,400
With the boy

556
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,810
who's closest to you.

557
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,460
Has

558
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,850
Panpan not given up on Mr. Gu?

559
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,530
That's not good.

560
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,710
Forget it.

561
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,860
You still haven't let go of Zhu Yi?

562
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,370
Zhu... Zhu Yi?

563
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,040
There's nothing between us.

564
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Then call him

565
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,110
now

566
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,440
and tell him

567
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,840
I'm packed.

568
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,610
Yang Panpan is leaving.

569
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,410
Okay.

570
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,840
Hurry.

571
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:08,650
Now?

572
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,470
Alright.

573
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,770
Okay.

574
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,320
Put it on speaker.

575
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,100
Play it out loud?

576
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,240
Are there any secrets between you two

577
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,570
that I can't know about?

578
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,610
Smile, okay?

579
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,300
Come on, stand in position.

580
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,200
Hello?

581
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,430
Calling me instead of going on a date.

582
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,230
You missed me?

583
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,600
I have something to tell you.

584
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,180
You thought it through

585
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,530
and decided to confess to me?

586
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,650
Not me, but Yang Panpan.

587
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,940
She wants to confess to me?

588
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,280
Are you threatening me?

589
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,000
Nonsense!

590
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,440
Who wants to confess to you?

591
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,170
I'm leaving.

592
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,140
Hao Liang insisted on telling you.

593
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,270
I couldn't stop her.

594
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,690
I'm leaving. That's all.

595
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,720
Bye.

596
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,970
Hello?

597
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,840
Here.

598
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,520
I insisted on telling...

599
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,980
What did she say?

600
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,770
Who's that?

601
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,290
Why are you here?

602
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,540
Are you here for me?

603
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,050
I'm here for Dan.

604
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,820
Why?

605
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,770
Dan insisted that I come

606
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,680
to persuade you

607
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,740
to stay in Shanghai, alright?

608
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,760
No, I...

609
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,980
You're not sincere.

610
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,570
I came here personally.

611
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,000
Can't you have a heart?

612
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,410
Yes or no?

613
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,940
Fine.

614
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,570
Then I...

615
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,530
-Go out.
-Go out.

616
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,090
Pan.

617
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,360
Mr. Gu.

618
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Who's Mr. Gu?

619
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,880
I'm your mother.

620
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,100
I'm at the train station now.

621
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,680
See you at Aunt Yibai's

622
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,750
in half an hour.

623
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,570
Oh no.

624
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,750
Does my mom know

625
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,730
about Dai?

626
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,050
Don't panic.

627
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,940
If she didn't know,

628
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,900
why would she come suddenly?

629
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,930
Aren't you about to graduate?

630
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,810
It's normal for her to visit you.

631
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:01,650
No matter what,

632
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,560
I can't let my mom know

633
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,690
of Dai's existence.

634
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:05,810
Selfie light.

635
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,220
Don't speak.

636
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,850
Cousin.

637
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,580
You're downstairs?

638
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,570
Okay.

639
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,730
I'll be right there.

640
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,770
Your mom is downstairs.

641
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,410
Hurry up.

642
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,070
Hurry up. Keep everything.

643
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,360
Mom.

644
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,570
I'll get changed now.

645
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,620
It's better for a girl

646
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,040
to be dignified.

647
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,770
Mom,

648
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,810
what's the reason

649
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,330
for your visit?

650
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,930
What do you think?

651
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,750
It's because

652
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,900
I'm about to graduate, right?

653
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,230
Oh no.

654
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,840
I only cleaned the room

655
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,520
and forgot the living room.

656
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,180
This is just a toy.

657
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,160
Toy?

658
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,200
Don't think I know nothing.

659
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,680
A student of mine

660
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,700
did this costume thing

661
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,890
and fooled around with all sorts of people.

662
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,620
Last month,

663
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,470
they dropped out.

664
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,810
No, no.

665
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,300
This...

666
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,610
Oh no.

667
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,660
She does know about Dai.

668
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,940
Actually, I...

669
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,180
Stop defending your aunt.

670
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,000
Me?

671
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,330
Don't think I can't control you

672
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,660
because you're old now.

673
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,040
You're acting like this.

674
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,020
How can I be at ease

675
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,300
leaving Dan with you?

676
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,810
Cousin.

677
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,600
Mom.

678
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,280
This mask

679
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,420
was actually worn by Aunt Yibai

680
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,220
to parties.

681
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,800
Don't make a fuss.

682
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,000
A levee of a thousand li can be destroyed by a single ant hole.

683
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,520
Big cities offer many temptations, and come with great risks.

684
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,480
Today, it's a masked party.

685
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,160
Tomorrow, it's

686
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,440
a naked party.

687
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,640
You'd better be careful.

688
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,030
It's your turn now.

689
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,440
Tell me.

690
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,480
Me?

691
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,770
If it's not about Dai,

692
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,330
what else could it be?

693
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,730
Now that you've grown up,

694
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,140
you're hiding from mom

695
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,600
that you have a boyfriend.

696
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,159
Well, maybe

697
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,260
I let it slip

698
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,010
when I was on the phone earlier.

699
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,139
I didn't.

700
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,520
Mom, I didn't.

701
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,730
Is it true or not?

702
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,440
Dan.

703
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,409
Stop hiding it from your mother.

704
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,230
Cousin.

705
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,150
Dan has a boyfriend.

706
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,120
He's nice.

707
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,400
He's quite reliable.

708
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,300
Let's have dinner with him.

709
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,510
W-w-what?

710
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,969
What?

711
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,290
You're not young anymore.

712
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,000
Why are you still

713
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,330
so muddled all the time?

714
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,810
If you two are serious,

715
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,719
I should

716
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
help you judge him

717
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,110
and appraise him.

718
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,050
Hello, Gu Jiuli.

719
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,440
I got my cousin for you.

720
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,250
You know what to do, right?

721
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,490
Let me tell you.

722
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,620
My cousin

723
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,640
has been a Director of Education

724
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,610
for over 30 years.

725
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,410
Nothing else.

726
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,420
Her eyes are like the Monkey King's.

727
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,350
She's a tough nut

728
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,680
to crack.

729
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,190
What does your cousin like?

730
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,080
What she likes?

731
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,130
Her biggest hobby

732
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,560
is to abide by the rules.

733
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,400
Oh yes.

734
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,900
She never accepts gifts.

735
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,270
If you want to please her

736
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,160
with gifts,

737
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,670
well,

738
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,460
it'll depend on fate.

739
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,640
Also.

740
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,650
Are you sure

741
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,050
you want to do it that way?

742
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,960
According to Yibai's

743
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,400
description of her cousin,

744
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,230
I'm not optimistic

745
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,230
about your plan.

746
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,160
Let's talk about it

747
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,110
after tomorrow.

748
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,600
Okay.

749
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,450
If it's up to me,

750
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,690
you should give her

751
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,020
a limited-edition bag.

752
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,090
A good bag treats all ailments.

753
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,180
Why do I think you're the one with an ailment?

754
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:08,950
Gold bars then.

755
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,640
Gold bars represent your heart.

756
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,690
So vulgar.

757
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,800
Vulgar. Fine.

758
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,550
Let me think of something that's not vulgar.

759
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,330
Nutritional products.

760
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,680
Nutritional products are definitely

761
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,810
a hit with everyone.

762
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,730
I don't want that.

763
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,220
I want to kill it with one shot.

764
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,520
Can't you give any good advice

765
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,920
with that brain of yours?

766
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,680
Gu Jiuli.

767
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm helping you out,

768
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,280
and it's fine if you don't thank me,

769
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,880
but now you're insulting me.

770
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,320
I didn't beg you.

771
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,120
You're so stubborn.

772
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:43,880
If you don't beg me,

773
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,940
I don't know what you can come up with.

774
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,850
What do you want to give her?

775
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,170
It's a secret.

776
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,190
You're so stubborn.

777
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,930
Mom,

778
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,370
why don't we order some food outside

779
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,410
and bring it back?

780
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,680
Cousin.

781
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,310
This is good Huaiyang cuisine.

782
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,290
It's close to here too.

783
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,090
How about this restaurant then?

784
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,830
I've tried it before. It's delicious.

785
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,080
This one is Hong Kong style.

786
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,170
It's good too.

787
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,270
Cousin.

788
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,240
You have to tell me

789
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,980
which restaurant you like.

790
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,780
Otherwise, I can't book a table,

791
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,420
right?

792
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,680
What's the rush?

793
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,890
I have my own plan.

794
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,200
Yicheng delivery.

795
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,010
Hello, Yicheng delivery.

796
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,120
Here are the dishes Ms. Song ordered.

797
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,890
Here you go.

798
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,930
Bye.

799
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,800
Mom.

800
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,260
You're not going to...

801
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,030
cook...

802
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,330
-are you?
-are you?

803
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,280
Dan's boyfriend is coming home for the first time.

804
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,080
How can I not show off my cooking?

805
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,210
There's no need.

806
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,430
Mom, don't bother.

807
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,600
Let's go out and eat.

808
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,400
I'll pay.

809
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,590
Are you afraid my cooking

810
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,400
won't be good?

811
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,850
No.

812
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,690
That's not what we meant.

813
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,500
Give it to me.

814
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,000
Cousin.

815
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,420
I'm just afraid

816
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,260
it's hard for you,

817
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,970
you came all this way

818
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,430
and you still have to cook.

819
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,240
It’s just Suzhou.

820
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,080
It’s 20 minutes on the high-speed rail.

821
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,010
It's not tiring.

822
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,240
It's not tiring at all.

823
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,010
You have to clean up if you cook.

824
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,230
It's troublesome.

825
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,800
I'm afraid you'll be tired.

826
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,160
How is it tiring?

827
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,960
You guys can help

828
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,160
too.

829
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,740
You haven't

830
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,450
had my cooking

831
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,800
for a long time.

832
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,560
Especially Dan.

833
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,760
You've lost weight.

834
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,500
I'll cook

835
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,780
your favorite dishes.

836
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,550
What do you want to eat?

837
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,570
I just read the recipe.

838
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,890
Buddha Jumps Over the Wall is not bad.

839
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,490
Buddha...

840
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,280
Buddha...

841
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,540
Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

842
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,690
Look at your smile.

843
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,480
What a smile on her face

844
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,570
once she heard

845
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,760
I'm going to make her favorite dish.

846
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,440
Give it to me.

847
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,980
The food will be ready soon.
