Where are you? Why aren't you down yet?

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,210
I just came downstairs

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,740

to clarify that Xiaojiu is a business robot,

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,070
not a care robot,

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,070
and

22
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,520
that all the rumors on the market are fake.

because of their busy work.

154
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,270
So, I deliberately

155
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,270
provoked them,

156
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,450
contradicted them,

157
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,950
and ignored them.

158
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,910
We

159
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,950
could always

160
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,200
embarrass each other.

161
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,640
We treated each other

162
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,600
in a way that would hurt each other.

163
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,350
Before they went on a business trip that day,

164
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,590
they wanted to have dinner with me together.

165
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,590
But I ran away without looking back.

166
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,070
Actually, I really wanted to tell them,

167
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,610
"I love you very much.

168
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,470
Can you not leave?

169
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,710
We're a family.

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,770
and have dinner together."

172
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,360
But I didn't even

173
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,450
have such a chance.

174
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,840

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,800
telling me that my parents had had a car accident.

176
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,020
I was totally dumbfounded.

177
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,040
I rushed to the hospital

178
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,430
but did nothing.

179
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,410
I just stood there.

180
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,080
Later,

181
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,910
the doctor came to cover them with a white cloth

182
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,390
and pushed them away.

183
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,190
Actually, I really regret it.

184
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,470
If I could

185
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,510
step forward

186
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,250
and hold their hands that day,

187
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,350
even just once,

188
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,760
it would be nice.

189
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,000
So, for me,

like a remedy

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,230
to make up the time

193
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,960
that I couldn't turn back,

194
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,330
to make up for the children

195
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,530
who might be in the same situation as me,

196
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,150
and to make up for my regret.

197
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,680
However,

198
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,840
that may be a luxury in the first place.

199
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,790
It's like a dream.

200
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,950
Since it's a dream,

201
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,890
you should wake up from it.

202
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,820
But that was your original aspiration.

203
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,910
Yes, it was my original aspiration,

204
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,890
but I can't be too selfish.

205
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,390
Even if Xiaojiu succeeded,

206
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,040
it couldn't replace

207
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,530
the younger me 12 years ago

208
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,890
to tell my parents how I felt.

209
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,350
Replacing your parents

210
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,210
and speaking out how you felt?

211
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,030
I have an idea.

212
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:38,790
Han.

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,390
Thank you.

217

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,670
in 20 minutes.

219
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,310
According to the analysis of the system,

220
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,950
you might need to...

221
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,070
Sorry.

222
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,240
There's no way to cope with sighing

223
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,560
in the database.

Understand what?

226
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,360
Humans are animals who lie.

227
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,070
In interpersonal communication,

228
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,000
the same expression

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,820
or sentence

230
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,440
may have opposite meanings.

231
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,310
Just like you thanked me just now,

232
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,110
you were actually being ironic.

233
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,670
So,

234
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,650
you want Xiaojiu to read

235
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,330
the true thoughts of a person,

236
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
so that it can help

237
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,880

238
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,310
I want to add the function

239
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,470
of interpreting emotions for Xiaojiu.

240
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,400
It's impossible, bro.

241
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,430
You can do it.

242
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,390
Of course.

249
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,430
You're all crazy.

250

Okay, go.

We still need to expand them.

Alright, you can stop talking.

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,230
used for testing

Since the beginning of the trial till now,

many teachers said

292
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,880
it has been very helpful

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,830
the youngest

311
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,190
in our class?

312
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,880
Yes.

313
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,110
We should treat him as a little brother.

314
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,240
Well, he hasn't learned

315
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,230
a lot of skills yet.

316
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,390
Should we forgive him?

do you want to take a handwork class?

We need to eat well

322
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,210
to have the energy to go to the handwork class.

323
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:13,650
Okay?

Let's go wash our hands.

325
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,560
This kid was born prematurely.

326
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,270
And he got into kindergarten at a relatively early age.

327
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,790
So compared to kids of a similar age,

328
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,410
his development

329
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,540
is relatively slow.

330
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,220
Many misunderstandings happened

331
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,510
when he expressed himself.

332
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,470

00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,910

when that happened again,

335

our teacher

336
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,730
would use their phones

337
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,300

338
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,510
and read Xiaojiu's analysis data

339
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,480
so that it could help

340
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,210

341
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,550

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,790
Tonight,

387
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,050
I want to announce

388
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,250
an important decision.

389
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,430
Is the final list of the Qiqiu Grand Ceremony

390
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,670
going to be announced?

391
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,190
My Dai will dominate the stage!

392
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,060
Beat Cute Mengmeng

393
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,470
at the Qixiu Grand Ceremony!

394
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,390
I've decided

395
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,290
to quit the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

396
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,470
That's settled, then.

397
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,310
I'll ask the lawyer

398
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,030
to revise the framework agreement.

399
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,960
The condition is

400
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,470
that it must be worthy of

401
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,000
[Sniper Boy]

402
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,000
[Group Message: Emergency Assembly]

403
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,030
Jiuqian's current status as a unicorn company

404
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,030
in the industry.

405
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,670
I look forward to working with you.

406
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,800
Happy cooperation.

407
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,560
Happy cooperation.

408
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,630
Cathy.

409
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,790
You're old friends.

410
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,800
You can't be biased towards Jiuli.

411
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,230
Of course not.

412
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,650
Business is business.

413
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,910
Cheers.

414
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,290
I'm on live.

415
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,040
Are you okay?

416
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,870
Of course.

417
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,480
I'll pick you up at K11 when it's over.

418
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,900
Mr. Gu, don't you have dinner today?

419
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,560
Why did you come and pick me up?

420
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,830
Did you miss the livestream that day

421
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,790
because of me?

422
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,580
Did you come to pick me up

423
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,270
because you were too touched?

424
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,950
Did you quit the Qixiu Grand Ceremony

425
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,370
because of me, as well?

426
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,230
You overestimate your importance.

427
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,300
Then why?

428
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,550
You were not wrong.

429
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,400
It's kind of because of you.

430
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,750
This is your reward.

431
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,890
You help me stick to my original aspiration,

432
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,770
so I decide to give up on the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

433
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,700
To be honest,

434
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,330
I've been lost all this time.

435
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,870
No matter what I do,

436
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,820
I can't meet Jason's requirements

437
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,810
or keep up with Cute Mengmeng.

438
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,140
So, I missed the livestream,

439
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,870
not entirely because of you.

440
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,550
I also wanted to take a break.

441
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,590
Then I am

442
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,810
not a good boyfriend.

443
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,070
You are.

444
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,550
You made me realize

445
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,060
that sticking to my original inspiration

446
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,110
is not to cater to others' requirements

447
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,110
but to find my own characteristics.

448
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,910
I've also figured out

449
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,230
that what I am really good at and truly like

450
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,690
is not singing and dancing

451
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,500
but only singing all along.

452
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,310
I didn't even need to stand up

453
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,220
when I used to do a livestream.

454
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,800
Now,

455
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,790
I have to sing and dance on the stage.

456
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,650
Is that still Dai, who I used to be?

457
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,710
So, I've decided

458
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,050
this time,

459
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,080
I'll be myself with confidence.

460
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,120
I'm not going to participate in the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

461
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,560
I'm with you.

462
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,150
Mr. Gu, did you blame yourself just now?

463
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,710
No.

464
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,240
Why did you blame yourself?

465
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,510
No reason.

466
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,990
Fine.

467
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,330
I'll ask Mole on the eyebrow.

468
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,070
You don't tell me anyway.

469
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,870
Here's the thing.

470
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,680
Your fans

471
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,240
said you were bewitched

472
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,200
by some young boy

473
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,270
and quit the Qixiu Grand Ceremony

474
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,910
because you were too in love.

475
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,670
Young boy?

476
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,390
Mr. Gu? Young boy?

477
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,190
Tell me.

478
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,110
Do I look

479
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,270
that young?

480
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,010
Anyway, it's true I'm in love.

481
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,880
Let's go.

482
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,310
I'll take you home first.

483
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,470
A huge breakthrough!

484
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,810
I found the secret alternative Weibo account

485
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,440
of the young boy

486
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,550
and Dai.

487
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,870
The standard outfit for a young boy.

488
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,070
It's so attractive to girls.

489
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,990
Look at the cheap red string on his wrist.

490
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,990
My sister sold it before.

491
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,920
The wholesale price is five cents.

492
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,080
This young boy

493
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,070
looks unemployed.

494
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,130
He looks like a standard freeloader.

495
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,210
Let's have desserts tomorrow.

496
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,470
Mr. Gu.

497
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,960
I thought

498
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,920
you didn't like this dessert shop.

499
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,690
You specially ordered these.

500
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,110
I'm sure you can't wait to eat.

501
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,630
Eat up.

502
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,930
Aren't you taking photos?

503
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,730
No, I did it last time.

504
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,710
How could it be the same

505
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,570
with last time?

506
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,880
There are many things here we didn't order last time.

507
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,370
Take a photo first.

508
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,060
Okay, I'll take a photo.

509
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,630
It's a bit hard in my pocket.

510
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,230
It hurts.

511
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,390
Okay, it's done.

512
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,070
Let's eat.

513
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,680
Aren't you going to edit it?

514
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,270
No, I can edit it when I get back.

515
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,470
The smoothie is melting.

516
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,350
It's okay. We can order another if it melts.

517
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,750
We have time to play with.

518
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,230
You can edit the photo first.

519
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,760
I don't mean anything else.

520
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,850
I'm just afraid that if we miss it,

521
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,990
we won't be able to take a photo again.

522
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,470
But the lighting and composition of this photo

523
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,750
are pretty good.

524
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,150
Let me see.

525
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,130
Let's use this one.

526
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,590
Okay, we'll choose this one.

527
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,350
All the desserts are in it.

528
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,330
But why do I get the feeling

529
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,780
that it lacks a soul?

530
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,540
A soul?

531
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,230
So this is the soul

532
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,650
Mr. Gu was talking about.

533
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,260
Okay.

534
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,180
Eat.

535
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,310
Won't you post it on Weibo?

536
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,970
Yes! I'll do it now.

537
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,510
It's up to you.

538
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,480
I'm fine with anything.

539
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,570
Done.

540
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,770
Well,

541
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,190
Hao Liang, are you busy now?

542
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,720
I'll pick you up for dinner.

543
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,350
Mr. Gu.

544
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,690
I have something to do.

545
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,140
I'll tell you to come out when I'm done.

546
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,890
Bye for now.

547
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:51,870
Okay.

548
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,930
When you receive it,

549
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,360
it will come with a bowl

550
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,510
and

551
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,510
a stir bar.

552
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,480
And this.

553
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,830
The seaweed facial mask.

554
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,160
Let's take a look first.

555
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,110
It's like this.

556
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,130
It's in small grains, a bit like sand.

557
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,850
It is totally natural.

558
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,690
There are no

559
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,170
chemical additives at all.

560
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,750
Surprise!

561
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,980
The door is closed.

562
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,720
[Anti-aging, Men's Seaweed Mask]

563
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
No need to wash it.

564
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,820
You can peel it off.

565
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,560
Did you do all this

566
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,500
for me?

567
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:57,980
No.

568
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,910
Han Yijie

569
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,030
insisted on me testing it.

570
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,040
But it is your name

571
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,110
on the package.

572
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,710
Han wrote my name.

573
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,270
Does my face need facial masks?

574
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,240
The wrinkles on your forehead, crow's feet,

575
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,190
and nasolabial folds

576
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,550
do need targeted treatment.

577
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,950
You need to do several anti-aging facials.

578
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,860
You're getting bolder.

579
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,510
Can we teach an old dog

580
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,740
a new trick?

581
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,560
What did you say?

582
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,740
What are you doing?

583
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,230
What?

584
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,530
I'm answering your question.

585
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,760
Why are there

586
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,950
so many things?

587
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,400
Do you have eggs?

588
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,440
What for?

589
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,380
Today

590
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,070
is our 100th day anniversary.

591
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,440
I'll make you

592
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,340
a chiffon cake.

593
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,140
You can cook?

594
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,160
Don't forget

595
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,710
my aunt is a food blogger.

596
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,270
I have experience in cooking.

597
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,400
Doesn't your aunt cook dark cuisine?

598
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,380
Pretty much.

599
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,110
This time,

600
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,750
I've made full preparations.

601
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,670
Look, I've downloaded a lesson.

602
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,429
Oh no.

603
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,489
I didn't bring an electronic scale.

604
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,980
How many grams of flour do you want?

605
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,870
52 grams.

606
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,550
52 grams.

607
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,639
To make this chiffon cake,

608
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,190
I must use the exact amount of ingredients.

609
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,110
A little error may make a great difference.

610
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,260
The density of flour

611
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,750
is 520 grams per milliliter.

612
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,750
The capacity of this cup

613
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,880
is 200 milliliters.

614
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,800
You need

615
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,970
52 grams of flour.

616
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,630
If we convert it to volume,

617
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,800
it should be 100 ml.

618
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,580
So, this should be it.

619
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,130
I also need 10 grams of cornstarch.

620
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,250
How about

621
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,920
we order takeout?

622
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,580
No.

623
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,550
Today is

624
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,750
our 100-day anniversary.

625
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,810
I want to make a cake

626
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,710
in person.

627
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,990
But you didn't bring

628
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,790
your electronic scale, did you?

629
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,960
I have you.

630
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,270
I'll give you a chance

631
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,320
to contribute

632
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,090
to our 100th day anniversary.

633
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,030
What do you need me to do?

634
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,510
Bring everything here.

635
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,750
Mr. Gu,

636
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,020
you're a scale yourself,

637
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,670
and you're much more reliable than an electronic scale.

638
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,470
What? You're going to whisk the egg white manually?

639
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,910
When I cook at my mom's place,

640
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,640
I always beat the eggs this way.

641
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,060
We whisk the egg white

642
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,520
to incorporate air into it

643
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,150
to increase its surface area

644
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,110
and thus make the cake taste better.

645
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,710
That's why we usually choose

646
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,150
an electric whisker.

647
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,570
Is there a difference?

648
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,750
The speed and strength of your hands

649
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,610
are not enough to mix the air in it.

650
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,690
If you work at it hard enough,

651
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,630
you can grind an iron rod into a needle.

652
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,160
Go for it!

653
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:02,950
Forget it.

654
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,630
Let's order takeout.

655
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,630
No.

656
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,910
We've come this far.

657
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,220
Let me do it.

658
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,870
Didn't you say we can't beat the air in

659
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,880
with our strength?

660
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,760
Let me try.

661
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,040
You mean

662
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,200
you really want to whisk the egg white?

663
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,750
Forget it.

664
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,430
I really want to whisk the egg white.

665
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,210
So your hobby is

666
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,440
to whisk egg whites?

667
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,990
Yes.

668
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,750
My hobby is to whisk egg whites.

669
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,560
Good luck, Mr. Gu.

670
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,020
I'm going to the bathroom.

671
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,770
What are you doing, Gu?

672
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,030
I thought

673
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,360
I came back at a bad time.

674
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,660
Give me the car key.

675
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,920
I'll leave right away.

676
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,280
Help me whisk the egg white.

677
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,030
Make some contributions

678
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,640
to my 100-day anniversary.

679
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,550
No need.

680
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,030
Do you think I'm a donkey?

681
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,690
Did I come back to work for you?

682
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,410
So you won't be able to

683
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,690
drive my car today.

684
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,740
You...

685
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,530
My car needs maintenance.

686
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:45,770
Fine.

687
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:50,830
Hurry up.

688
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,280
Beat the air into the egg white.

689
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,070
Jie.

690
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,470
Why are you whisking the egg white?

691
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,070
I'm making contributions

692
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,760
to your 100-day anniversary.

693
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,030
That's enough.

694
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,230
You can go.

695
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,110
Fine, I'll get lost.

696
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,820
I'll get lost.

697
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,870
Have fun.

698
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,260
It's almost done.

699
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,460
Bring everything in.

700
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,380
The door is closed.
