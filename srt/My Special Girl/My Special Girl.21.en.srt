[Episode 21]

4
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,570
Why are you

5
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
torturing yourself?

6
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,940
Do you remember

7
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,450
what I told you

8
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,579
when we broke up?when you broke up with Dazuo?

9
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,410
I just want you to

10
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,530
look back on this day

11
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,880
and think it wasn't so bad

12
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,010
because I was there.

13
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,060
Let's go.

14
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,829
On to the next ride.

15
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,730
Boring.

16
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,090
I'm done.

17
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,690
No.

18
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,690
I'm very happy today.

19
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,440
Thank you.

20
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,920
You're not mad at me anymore?

21
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,920
Why would I be?

22
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,860
I'm going home. Rest early.

23
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,250
You're leaving just like that?

24
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,250
What a pity.

25
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,630
Haven't you vomited enough?

26
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,690
There are

27
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,090
easy rides in the amusement park too.

28
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,620
For example, the carousel.

29
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,780
Don't worry.

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,670
On the carousel,

31
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,600
I won't throw up.

32
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,170
Carousel?

33
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,880
That's not bad.

34
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,840
When Gu and I were little,

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,100
we really liked sitting on the carousel.

36
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,120
If we're going to the carousel

37
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,270
I have a suggestion.

38
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,730
If you two make it happen,

39
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,550
I'll be even happier.

40
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,390
Okay.

41
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,990
Gu,

42
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,370
we've relived our old dreams.

43
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,060
Please.

44
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,460
Ride it once with me.

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
Han Yijie,

46
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,690
you can't

47
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,780
drag me into this

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,460
just to make Chen Yibai happy.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
You can't say that.

50
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,650
Yibai is doing it for our own good.

51
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,870
She wants us to

52
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,339
ride the carousel again together.

53
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,180
Why?

54
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,709
She just wants us

55
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,910
to find our childhood happiness again.

56
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,530
Besides,

57
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,450
Dan wants to see you on it too.

58
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,640
There's no need.

59
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,230
Fine.

60
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,750
If you don't go,

61
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,470
I'll go with Dan.

62
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,170
No.

63
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,480
I get dizzy

64
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,430
on anything that spins.

65
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,030
Mr. Gu, you should go.

66
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,580
Gu, I'm begging you.

67
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,620
Go.

68
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,690
Smile.

69
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,580
Great.

70
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,570
Great. Beautiful.

71
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:24,930
Come on.

72
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,340
One more time.

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
Five, six, seven, go.

74
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,430
Down, down.

75
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,920
Grab.

76
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,860
Back.

77
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,590
Up.

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,030
Up.

79
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,730
Down.

80
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,710
Side.

81
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,560
Go one round

82
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,260
and down.

83
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,740
Up.

84
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,990
Are you tired?

85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,710
Take a rest.

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,460
It's the eighth time already.

87
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,230
Didn't you do it eight times too?

88
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,440
You have no problems with your breath at all.

89
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,100
Go and rest.

90
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,940
I'll practice a little longer.

91
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,690
You can do it.

92
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,710
No need to practice anymore.

93
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,530
Qixiu Grand Ceremony

94
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,520
is just one month away.

95
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,830
You're still out of breath

96
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,110
when you dance.

97
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,680
How can you perform?

98
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,610
There's still a month to go

99
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,000
before the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
That means

101
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,710
I still have one month

102
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,510
to practice.

103
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,490
Not all efforts

104
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,590
reap rewards.

105
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,730
Do you think those who do Tongzigong

106
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,860
practice for nothing?

107
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,160
You're not a professional.

108
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,990
No matter how hard you train,

109
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,940
it's useless.

110
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,500
Whether it is a waste of energy,

111
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,510
we'll only find out

112
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,510
in a month's time.

113
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
Before that,

114
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,890
I'm willing to spend my energy on this

115
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,020
even if it's a waste.

116
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,140
You're willing?

117
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,830
Is everyone willing to...

118
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,360
Alright.

119
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,950
Jason.

120
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,420
Dai has improved a lot.

121
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,860
Give her a chance.

122
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,450
It takes 10 years of practice

123
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,180
for a one-minute performance on stage.

124
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,030
No one cares

125
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,190
how much progress she made.

126
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,159
All anyone can see

127
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,070
is the final result

128
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,500
on the stage.

129
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,420
There's a gap between you two.

130
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,960
She's got a huge

131
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,180
fan following online.

132
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,610
It's not good to change the program

133
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,470
and the last minute.

134
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,430
The final program

135
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,490
hasn't come out yet

136
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,020
and we haven't made any official announcements.

137
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,500
I'll only judge

138
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,320
what I see

139
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,180
onstage.

140
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,230
Persuade her

141
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,320
to give up sooner.

142
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,520
It's better for everyone.

143
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,120
Jason.

144
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,990
Are you okay?

145
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,350
I'm fine.

146
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,290
Let's practice again.

147
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,110
Take it easy.

148
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,360
How many times has it been?

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,290
The handsome guy at the door

150
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,490
has been waiting for you for a long time.

151
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,550
Although I get out of breath when singing and dancing,

152
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,630
I can do this

153
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,840
on my own.

154
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,580
Just focus on driving.

155
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,260
I'm fine.

156
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,920
Dan, you're back.

157
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,210
Why did the Student Association

158
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,040
give such a notice?

159
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,330
What notice?

160
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,070
The morning run.

161
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,710
I forgot that tomorrow is Wednesday

162
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,700
and we have to jog in the morning.

163
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,140
Why am I so unlucky?

164
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,750
I'm already exhausted and I still have to run.

165
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,110
Dan.

166
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,400
As a modern person,

167
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,000
don't you look at your phone?

168
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,270
The Student Association released a notice to say that

169
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,500
in order to help us seniors get jobs

170
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,100
the morning run for seniors

171
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
will be canceled.

172
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,490
Look.

173
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,550
I'm back on my feet!

174
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,870
How boring.

175
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,610
Do you know how the boys who are chasing me

176
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,940
are showing their love?

177
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,640
They can't give me a milkshake every day.

178
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,530
I'm tired of it.

179
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,060
God must have heard

180
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,800
my prayers.

181
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,700
I finally don't have to wake up early tomorrow.

182
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,920
That's one more thing that I hate

183
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,680
removed.

184
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,280
I, Hao Liang, finally

185
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,740
don't have to run anymore.

186
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,270
Hao Liang.

187
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,220
Hao Liang!

188
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,720
Look at the time. Why are you still in bed?

189
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,430
Someone is looking for you downstairs.

190
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,340
Get up.

191
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,560
Isn't my Freshippo breakfast

192
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,220
only supposed to arrive at 10?

193
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,860
Sorry.

194
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,280
Let's go.

195
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
It's so light.

196
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,500
Didn't I buy two boxes of milk?

197
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,450
Mr. Gu.

198
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
Why are you here?

199
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,530
I'll go back and get changed.

200
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,780
Change into that.

201
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,040
I'll wait for you here.

202
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,140
Okay.

203
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,710
Oh no.

204
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,550
My wonderful image in Mr. Gu's heart

205
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,680
has been shattered.

206
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,320
Crumbled.

207
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,320
Dan, where are you going?

208
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,360
This set

209
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,670
looks great.

210
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,010
This is the physical training recovery program

211
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,270
that I made for you.

212
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,520
As long as we follow this program,

213
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,540
after a week,

214
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,670
your breathing while singing and dancing

215
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,440
will definitely

216
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,840
show great improvement.

217
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,200
Mr. Gu,

218
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,600
I remember now.

219
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,870
My period is coming.

220
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,270
Didn't it

221
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,940
just come last week?

222
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,790
My...

223
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,180
My cycle is irregular.

224
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,660
It's here again.

225
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,570
Let's go to the hospital then.

226
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,270
No need.

227
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,190
I...

228
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,030
I got it wrong.

229
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,430
Anything else?

230
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,030
Let's begin.

231
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,100
My body is clear.

232
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,430
My body is clear.

233
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,470
My body is clear.

234
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,870
Hao Liang.

235
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,990
What are you doing?

236
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:31,770
Mr. Gu.

237
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,890
I'm hungry.

238
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,520
Right.

239
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,350
You're hungry.

240
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,120
You've worked hard.

241
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Give me your hand.

242
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,700
What is this?

243
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,020
The warm-up

244
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,990
is over.

245
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,900
Next,

246
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,990
is a 7-minute tempo run.

247
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,980
But that 800 meters just now

248
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,290
almost killed me.

249
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,230
You don't want a bun anymore?

250
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,980
I don't want a bun anymore.

251
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,070
The Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

252
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,670
You don't want to go anymore?

253
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,490
I want to.

254
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,420
Come on.

255
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,030
Hurry up.

256
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,190
Swing your arms.

257
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,240
Very good.

258
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,900
Hurry up.

259
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,460
Breathe.

260
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,380
Yes.

261
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,570
Hurry up.

262
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,800
[Ready]

263
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,930
[Go]

264
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,350
You've improved a bit.

265
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,900
Breathe.

266
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,270
Hurry up.

267
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,260
Faster.

268
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,580
Here.

269
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,990
There's more.

270
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,340
Don't stop. Go on.

271
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,460
I'll run with you.

272
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,090
Hurry.

273
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,020
Recently, the market

274
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,910
has been quite good.

275
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,390
Mr. Gu.

276
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,230
Gu.

277
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,300
Okay, we can start now.

278
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,790
First of all...

279
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,100
Should we have Japanese food

280
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,060
or barbecue today?

281
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,050
Both are fine, you pick.

282
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,770
Let's have sukiyaki.

283
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,290
Sure.

284
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,060
Dan.

285
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,020
What's wrong?

286
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,780
Are you guys fighting?

287
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,780
I'm leaving. Bye.

288
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,050
This is not a fight.

289
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,850
This is domestic violence.

290
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,660
No.

291
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,440
Mr. Gu's doing it for my own good.

292
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,580
Strengthening physical training.

293
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,750
Gu Jiuli

294
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,770
did this to you?

295
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,180
Exactly.

296
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,520
He said he loves you

297
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,000
and acts so affectionate.

298
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,820
Yet he still wants to change you.

299
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,880
It's not like that.

300
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,740
He's not changing me.

301
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,060
This is what I need.

302
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,910
Do you need it or does he need it?

303
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,220
Indeed.

304
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,780
Do you need it or does he need it?

305
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,460
To love someone

306
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,000
is to accept all of her.

307
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,680
Why does he want to change you?

308
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,380
It's not the same thing.

309
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,510
It's the same thing.

310
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,540
Stop running.

311
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,720
No.

312
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
I have to run by myself.

313
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,020
These records will be sent

314
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,859
to the app.

315
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,839
Do you really want to run

316
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,770
or are you afraid he'll find out you're slacking off?

317
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,940
It's both.

318
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,420
Can you still run?

319
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,190
These things

320
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,020
only record data.

321
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,750
It doesn't matter who wears it.

322
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,940
If it doesn't matter who wears it,

323
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,220
why are you wearing it?

324
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,360
None of your business.

325
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,740
Let's go.

326
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,660
None...of...

327
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:34,730
Are you okay?

328
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,140
You...

329
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,600
Did you get a cramp?

330
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,950
I'm fine. I feel better.

331
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,350
It's none of my business?

332
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,660
None of my business.

333
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,220
After the final assessment,

334
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,440
we can start

335
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,330
pre-launch promotion

336
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,300
for Xiaojiu.

337
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,030
Perfect.

338
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,320
It's six months ahead of

339
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,170
similar products

340
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:54,950
and we're beating them to the punch

341
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,750
in terms of market expectations.

342
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,880
I can already see

343
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,880
the fiery scenes

344
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,370
of people snatching it up.

345
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,110
They'll have nothing to say this time, right?

346
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,640
Alright.

347
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,570
That's all for today.

348
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,020
Okay.

349
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
Let me see you off.

350
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,780
[Yang Panpan]

351
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:18,870
Hello.

352
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,620
I'm looking for Gu Jiuli.

353
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,660
It's important.

354
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:32,990
Dan.

355
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,500
Here.

356
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,660
Thanks.

357
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,650
Don't mention it.

358
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,660
That abusive guy has gone too far.

359
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,350
He's doing it for my own good.

360
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,450
Compared to Cute Mengmeng,

361
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,150
my fitness level

362
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,320
is way off.

363
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,150
How could that be for your own good?

364
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,100
Have you ever been

365
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,470
someone who runs well?

366
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,690
Isn't he the sponsor?

367
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,740
If he's serious,

368
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,300
he should put you on the program list.

369
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,030
Zhu Yi.

370
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,120
You know

371
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,470
that's not what I think.

372
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,710
Besides,

373
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,760
it's only meaningful

374
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,510
if I achieve it

375
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,640
with my own efforts.

376
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,660
And he doesn't know that

377
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,920
I hate running so much.

378
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,500
Alright.

379
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,160
You just got together

380
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,750
and you're already speaking for him like that.

381
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,190
You'll suffer in the future.

382
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm leaving.

383
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,310
Thanks for this.

384
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:23,980
Hello, Hao Liang.

385
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,340
Hello.

386
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,940
Hao Liang.

387
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,530
Why are you here?

388
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,020
Have you ran the allocated distance

389
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,760
for today?

390
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,180
Four kilometers.

391
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,790
Your fitness has indeed improved.

392
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,860
You don't look

393
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,260
very tired today either.

394
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,100
Maybe

395
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,460
I got used to it.

396
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,970
The training is indeed useful.

397
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,780
Your tempo run is now close to five minutes.

398
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,330
Your training is very effective.

399
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,570
That's the level of

400
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,990
a professional athlete.

401
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,740
I forgot to ask Zhu Yi

402
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,540
to run slower.

403
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,300
How about this?

404
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,690
I'll sign you up for a professional half-marathon

405
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,980
and you can get a medal.

406
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,900
Mr. Gu, I was wrong.

407
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,630
I didn't run.

408
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,300
Go on.

409
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,030
Why did you get Zhu Yi to run for you?

410
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,020
How did you know it was Zhu Yi?

411
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,630
You knew it from the start.

412
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,210
You were testing me.

413
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,710
You didn't tell me the truth either.

414
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,460
I-I-I don't like running.

415
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,920
Leave me alone from now on.

416
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,700
Running can improve

417
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,260
your breathing when singing and dancing.

418
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,390
Don't do this again.

419
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,830
N-N-No.

420
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,410
What?

421
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,940
I'm not running anymore.

422
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,580
Leave me alone.

423
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,340
No.

424
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,730
This is not

425
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,160
how I pictured my relationship to be at all.

426
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,300
How did you picture your relationship

427
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,100
then?

428
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,880
At the mall,

429
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,730
when I skinned my feet,

430
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,260
why didn't you carry me?

431
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,050
Aren't slippers more comfortable?

432
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,360
Other boyfriends

433
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,270
try their best

434
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,460
to help their girlfriends

435
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,430
so that they won't suffer.

436
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,660
The domineering CEO in the drama

437
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,510
even bought a fish pond for his lover.

438
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,380
Why is it that when it comes to me

439
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,940
it's just running and more running?

440
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,670
So you want me to

441
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,660
sponsor Qixiu Grand Ceremony

442
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,260
and put you on the program.

443
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,180
I...

444
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,420
You just don't love me.

445
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,800
If you loved me, you wouldn't make me run.

446
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,300
What you're describing is pig rearing,

447
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,340
not dating.

448
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,380
If I really did that,

449
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,530
it wouldn't be good for you

450
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,120
and I'd be harming you.

451
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,880
Love should be about two people

452
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,010
improving together

453
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,860
with the intention of

454
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,520
making each other better.

455
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,020
I know you hate running.

456
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,620
But I also know that

457
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,660
you want to prove yourself

458
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,990
at Qixiu Grand Ceremony

459
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,910
and be your true self for once.

460
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,710
But you can't have it both ways.

461
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,740
Think carefully.

462
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,300
Do you want to enjoy the temporary pleasure

463
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,830
or achieve your final goal?

464
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,420
Once you decide,

465
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,000
you have to bear with the process.

466
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,560
Don't forget why you started.

467
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,480
I'll run the two kilometers that I owe.

468
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,200
Xiaojiu is finally on the market.

469
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,660
At present,

470
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,060
the market response is really good.

471
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,180
Rest assured, Mr. Gu,

472
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,880
for subsequent investment plans,

have no problems with it,

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,140
we can sign it.

the financing on this one.

Mr. Gu, bad news.

493
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,740
Something big happened.

494
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,870
Go online, quickly.

495
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,680
What is this?

496
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,910
Did you see the news?

Stop it.

We're sorry that

500
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,460
this happened.

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,620
what should we do?

520
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,230
Do we still send out

It's SmileTech.

534
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,340
After Xiaojiu's engine was upgraded,

535
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,450
it improved a lot.

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,760

They're trying to sway public opinion and smear Xiaojiu's reputation.

542
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,420
Ultimately, the market competes on products.

543
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,230
I'll ask Shi Fei

544
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,330
to draft a statement as soon as possible

545
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,930

is to not respond.

558
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,700

I know what you're worried about.

562
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,810
You're worried if Jiuqian

563
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,130
can survive this.

564
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,360

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,300
will SmileTech just watch and do nothing?

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,220
This time,

569
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,270
they've put everything on the line.

570
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,050

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,010
I'll try to delay it.

581
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,190
No need.

582
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,580
Pay them on time.

583
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,180
But the second round of financing has been delayed.

584
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,060
If we pay them

585
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,260
all the returns,

586
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,830
there will be no money on the books

587
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,590
for payroll.

588
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,850
This is not a reason to owe payment.

589
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,290
Mr. Gu.

590
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,580
I'll find a way

591
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,000
to make the money work.

592
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,560
Alright.

593
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,340
Coming. What would you like to drink?

594
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,140
Same as usual.

595
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,430
Is Jiuqian okay?

596
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,900
Why don't I

597
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
say something to my dad?

598
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,820
No need.

599
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,100
The Hua's Group

600
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,900
shouldn't get involved in this.

601
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,470
If the stocks fall because of this,

602
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,030
Jiuqian

603
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,430
won't be the only victim.

604
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,790
Then what are you

605
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,850
going to do next?

606
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,600
I have appointments with some funds.

607
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,980
Let's see if things turn around.

608
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,740
Where are you?

609
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,060
I just finished my meeting.

610
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,660
Let's have dinner together.

611
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,690
Sure.

612
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,040
I'm at Lujiazui.

613
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,710
I'll send you the address.

614
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,370
I have to do something urgent.

615
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,300
Let's talk later.

616
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,990
Go ahead.

617
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,990
See you later.

618
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,070
Mr. Wang,

619
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,130
didn't you say

620
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,180
you are very interested

621
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,180
in AI care robots?

622

623
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,110
Well...

624
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,420
I know Jiuqian

625
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,340
is very outstanding.

626
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,940
Thank you.

627
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,580
But things have changed.

628
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,580
Back then,

629
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,790
we were really interested

630
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,750
and wanted a share in your investment.

631
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,100
But now, Xiaojiu

632
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,670
is a hot potato.

633
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,760
Who dares to touch it?

634
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,840
Right, I know that.

635
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,030
Could you,

636
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,100
for the sake of our working relationship...

637
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,280
I'm telling you this

638
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,540
precisely because

639
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,360
of our working relationship.

640
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,990
If it were someone else,

641
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,370
I think our conversation

642
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,170
would have...

643
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,340
Okay, I got it.

644
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,030
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

645
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,550
I didn't expect

646
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,590
I would be done so soon.

647
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,070
I thought it would take a while.

648
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,330

649
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,660

Why are you looking at me like that?

653

You can't be serious for more than three seconds.

Otherwise, Gu and I

660
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,810
will have to hold hands

661
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,410
and jump into Huangpu River.

00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,780
But I can definitely decide

773
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,860
not to invest.

774
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,040
You're not here

775
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,940
to talk about investment at all.

776
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,980
You're just here to make trouble.

777
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,510
Yes.

778
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,179
I'm here to make trouble.

779
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,100
So what?

780
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,010
Go and see

781
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,760
who dares to invest in you now.

782
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,460
I am your client.

783
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,620
What are you doing, Chen Yibai?

784
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,740
What did you call me?

785
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,200
Chen...

786
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,400
Chen Yibai.

787
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,420
You know my name.

788
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,260
What else would I be afraid to...

789
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,740
Yibai!

790
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,210
Thank you, Manager Zhao.

791
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,100
I've got

792
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,050
your response.

793
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,240
I won't waste your time.

794
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,550
Sir, would you like to pay the bill?

795
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,760
I'm paying?

796
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,660
Sorry.

797
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,080
I thought

798
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,300
I could help you.

799
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,660
I didn't expect it

800
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,920
would end up like this.

801
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,590
It's okay.

802
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,040
He may not be a good person,

803
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,250
but he's right.

804
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,540
I've already met dozens of investors

805
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,480
before I came.

806
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,350
Xiaojiu is the pits now.

807
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,930
No one dares to jump in.

808
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,590
I saw it coming.

809
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,960
Then why did you

810
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,070
push it to him so earnestly?

811
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,840
It's work,

812
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,540
of course I have to act professionally.

813
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,780
Business is business.

814
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,260
Personal affairs are personal.

815
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,940
I'm quite professional.

816
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,260
Plus, I get to see Yibai

817
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,180
defending me.

818
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,330
I'd be happy to wash feet,

819
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,880
let alone pour tea.

820
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,470
Dream on.

821
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,160
If you want to wash feet,

822
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,440
you can only wash mine.

823
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,860
Not bad.

824
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,960
You not even out of breath.

825
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,510
Your breath is so stable.

826
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,380
Is there some sort of secret?

827
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,460
It's because of love.

828
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,200
What did I do wrong

829
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,750
to have to see you show off your relationship?

830
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,100
Though,

831
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,340
after these practices,

832
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,780
there shouldn't be any more problems.

833
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,110
Because you're already

834
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,020
more than able to sing and dance.

835
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,950
Especially since your specialty is high notes.

836
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,810
We still need to practise more.

837
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,580
A stupid bird like me

838
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
needs to flutter a few more times

839
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,640
to be at ease.

840
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,580
Flutter a few more times?

841
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,830
Cooping yourself up in the studio all day long

842
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,550
won't affect your love life?

843
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,900
I have to work harder

844
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,670
precisely because of love.

845
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,870
Stop talking. Hurry up.

846
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,140
The program will be released in a week

847
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,660
Jason.

848
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,490
and the overall staging

849
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,380
has been finalized.

850
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,860
In order to match the stage effects,

851
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,620
we've made big changes

852
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,020
to the style of the songs.

853
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,790
Jason, this...

854
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,690
The high notes have been taken out.

855
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,210
It's not a singing competition.

856
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,500
What's with high notes?

857
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,100
Can high notes

858
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,710
make the stage more exciting?

859
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,620
No, Jason.

860
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,300
Not only are the high notes gone,

861
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,220
the difficulty of the singing and dancing has increased

862
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,620
and difficult moves have also been added.

863
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,420
That's right.

864
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,620
It's been adjusted

865
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,800
to make our dance

866
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,010
more expressive.

867
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,220
But for Dai,

868
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,210
it doesn't capitalise on her strengths.

869
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,710
And the current difficult moves

870
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,280
are already at a professional level.

871
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,300
In such a short time...

872
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,530
This totally isn't something

873
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,540
that can be done in a day.

874
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,270
I can't sacrifice

875
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,260
the overall stage

876
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,060
for someone's strengths, can I?

877
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,330
Plus, this proposal

878
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,310
has already been improved in the meeting.

879
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,380
It can't be changed.

880
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,260
Good luck preparing for it.
