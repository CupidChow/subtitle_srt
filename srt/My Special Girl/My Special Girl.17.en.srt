[My Special Girl]

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,000
[Episode 17]

4
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,260
Men are controlled by visions;

5
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,710
women are controlled by emotions.

6
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,310
So candlelight and music

7
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,320
can bring out the atmosphere at critical moments.

8
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,260
Let's eat.

9
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,120
Dan.

10
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,070
You're in such a romantic scene,

11
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,780
yet you can't even cut the steak properly!

12
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,390
Have mine.

13
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,510
Is it good?

14
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,960
Yes.

15
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,570
Hello?

16
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,380
Who is it?

17
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,630
Are you Mr. Han?

18
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,070
I'm very sorry.

19
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,290
It was raining outside today,

20
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,440
and my electric bike fell down.

21
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,700
I changed a bag for you.

22
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,070
Would you like to check

23
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,130
to see if the thing inside is damaged?

24
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,800
No need.

25
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,570
I got it.

26
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,590
No, you'd better check it.

27
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,110
No, no, no. Really.

28
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,690
Please check it.

29
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,250
Otherwise,

30
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,940
I won't be able to explain.

31
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,350
No need.

32
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,310
Let me show you.

33
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,320
Look, this swimsuit

34
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,630
is intact.

35
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,430
It

36
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,370
is not damaged here.

37
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,090
It's to bring out the breasts.

38
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,909
And these spots

39
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,890
do not mean it's dirty.

40
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,600
It's

41
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,970
to show the female figure.

42
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,600
Okay, I got it.

43
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,350
I saw it. Okay.

44
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,720
Okay, please confirm the receipt of the goods.

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,510
Okay, I got it.

46
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,440
I'll confirm later.

47
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:44,960
Okay.

48
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,400
Go.

49
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,250
-Okay.
-Give me a five-star review, please.

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,950
Okay. Okay.

51
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,030
The door is closed.

52
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,640
Well...

53
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,120
I didn't buy this.

54
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,160
Han Yijie bought it.

55
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,970
Let's keep eating.

56
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,250
With such a terrible weather,

57
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,310
let's not drink

58
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,470
outdoor coffee.

59
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,659
What should we do?

60
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,920
What do you mean?

61
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,060
It's raining cats and dogs.

62
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,120
Let me send you home.

63
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,740
No. No.

64
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,650
No.

65
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,440
Going home this early,

66
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,820
I'll miss you.

67
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,860
It's a deal.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,320
No…

69
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:52,810
Be good.

70
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,530
Please.

71
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm leaving then.

72
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,220
Go.

73
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,570
Leave now.

74
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,640
I'm really leaving.

75
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,370
Go!

76
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,700
Drive slowly.

77
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,510
What did you get off…

78
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,170
Do you want to

79
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,460
stay with me for a little longer?

80
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,520
I want to be with you for a little longer,

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,050
and also, I can use the bathroom at your place.

82
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,760
At my place?

83
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,010
No, Yibai.

84
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,700
There's a mall there.

85
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,500
There are bathrooms in the mall.

86
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,740
I'll go to the mall with you.

87
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,800
I only need to use the bathroom.

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,600
Why can't I just go to your place?

89
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,140
Because

90
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,280
you need to take the elevator

91
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,980
to go to my place,

92
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,540
but there's a bathroom

93
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,700
right here on this floor of the mall.

94
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,230
Let's go.

95
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,130
I'm already downstairs.

96
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,150
Why should I go to the mall?

97
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,380
Because

98
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,250
the bathrooms in the mall are big and spacious.

99
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,830
Let's go.

100
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,180
You go home.

101
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,340
I'm going home, too.

102
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,380
Why did you change your mind?

103
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,650
Are you mad?

104
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,150
No.

105
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,490
You are mad.

106
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,940
It's not that I don't want you

107
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
to go to my place to use the bathroom.

108
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,480
It's just that Gu

109
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,810
has a bad hygienic habit.

110
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,140
Our bathroom is stinky.

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,670
If you have anything to say, say it.

112
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,130
Don't look at me like that.

113
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,100
Han Yijie,

114
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,470
if you have anything,

115
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,600
you can also tell me.

116
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,220
Anything.

117
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,650
I can bear the shock.

118
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,790
You don't think

119
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,660
I refuse to let you go to my place

120
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,590
because I have a secret, do you?

121
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,700
Yibai.

122
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,850
You misunderstood.

123
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,980
You really misunderstood.

124
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,240
What secret can I have?

125
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm definitely not

126
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,720
what you think.

127
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,570
Trust me, okay?

128
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,750
You don't believe me?

129
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,150
Let's go.

130
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,650
Let me show you upstairs.

131
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,490
I'm not going.

132
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,740
I'm going home.

133
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,310
No.

134
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,080
You have to go no matter what.

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,650
I must let you go up and have a look.

136
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,090
I...

137
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,640
I...

138
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,900
Yibai, don't worry. It must be...

139
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,870
I won't betray you.

140
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,270
There is definitely no one in my apartment.

141
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,780
Don't you trust me?

142
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,300
Look.

143
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,660
You're back?

144
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,830
Yes.

145
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,390
The door is closed.

146
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,100
Why didn't you turn on the lights

147
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,060
in the middle of the night?

148
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,770
Are you having a candlelight dinner alone?

149
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,450
I didn't know you were coming.

150
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,710
I only made

151
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,940
Han Yijie's serving.

152
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,820
Gu likes to be romantic.

153
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,470
It's the fun of an old man.

154
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,250
Look at me.

155
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,860
Am I not honest?

156
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,900
Is there anything unusual?

157
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,650
Is there?

158
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,090
Yibai said she wanted to

159
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,860
use our bathroom.

160
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,220
Yes, where is the bathroom?

161
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,880
Over there.

162
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,570
I'll turn on the light for you.

163
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:10,930
Okay.

164
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,770
Explain it to me.

165
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,620
How?

166
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,920
I can't explain it now.

167
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,050
The most important thing now

168
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,370
to escort Hao Liang out.

169
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,300
I'll go downstairs.

170
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,020
Hurry up.

171
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,030
Take it away.

172
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,950
No, no, no.

173
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,570
The elevator is too slow.

174
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,730
You'll run into each other.

175
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,970
Let me go out first.

176
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,180
Go to my room. Hurry!

177
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,040
Go!

178
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,870
Are you done?

179
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,960
Why did you close the door?

180
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
The wind blew it.

181
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,060
Yes, there's wind.

182
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,760
The wind did it?

183
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,600
Yes.

184
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,880
There's wind in this room.

185
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,430
Yes.

186
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,150
He's right.

187
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,060
Yibai, have some water.

188
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,180
Does she want water?

189
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,450
Yes.

190
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,560
You can't

191
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,910
drive her away too fast.

192
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,500
No wonder

193
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,070
you wouldn't let me come up.

194
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,140
And you said

195
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,980
Gu Jiuli has bad hygiene habits.

196
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,580
It was mainly because of this, right?

197
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,940
That is not mine.

198
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,330
That's Han Yijie's.

199
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,380
Gu.

200
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,460
What are you talking about?

201
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,820
I wanted to defend you,

202
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,120
yet you just slandered me

203
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,580
in front of my girlfriend.

204
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,870
Do you want me to show you

205
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,870
the packaging and the order number?

206
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
You like this?

207
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,960
How could I like that?

208
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,520
It's not my style.

209
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,620
If I say

210
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,530
the packaging and the order number

211
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,590
are wet by the rain,

212
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,900
will you believe it?

213
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,560
Do you think I'll believe you?

214
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,840
Gu,

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,100
we're all adults.

216
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,740
Even if you have this kind of peculiarity,

217
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,680
it's nothing.

218
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,270
Right?

219
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,220
Luckily, Dan broke up with him.

220
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,690
He's been single for a long time.

221
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,420
It's normal to have sexual desire.

222
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,980
Gosh, I regret it.

223
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,340
I should have listened to you.

224
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,360
I shouldn't have come up here.

225
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,140
Yes, you shouldn't have come up.

226
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,200
Let me send you out.

227
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,780
Let's go.

228
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,730
Hao Liang.

229
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
Why are you here?

230
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,230
I... I...

231
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,240
I'm here to hand over my work to Mr. Gu.

232
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,860
I need to finish some work.

233
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,730
Aunt Yibai, it's true.

234
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,720
Don't get me wrong. I...

235
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,270
Stop rummaging.

236
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,970
We're together now.

237
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,350
We were afraid you would object,

238
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,940
so we wanted to find a better chance to tell you.

239
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,330
But it's good

240
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,360
that you found out about us today.

241
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,980
We don't have to

242
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,380
keep it a secret anymore.

243
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,420
Although it's kind of embarrassing today,

244
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,220
I'm truly in love with Hao Liang.

245
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,790
If you don't believe me,

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
time can prove it.

247
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,940
Prove it?

248
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,620
How?

249
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,990
With the leopard-print swimsuit?

250
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
That swimsuit is actually not mine.

251
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,390
We're all family.

252
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,750
No need to be so serious.

253
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,980
Come on. Sit down.

254
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,930
Gu, have a seat.

255
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,580
Watch TV and relax.

256
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,160
Gu Jiuli!

257
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,550
Pervert!

258
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,160
[The door is open.]

259
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,490
Aunt Yibai, he's not that kind of person.

260
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,660
Not only have you learned how to lie,

261
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
but you're also going to defend him, too?

262
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,980
Yibai, listen to me.

263
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,820
Go in.

264
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,470
Yibai.

265
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,810
Let me see you off.

266
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,470
Don't come over. Stand there.

267
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,970
Close the elevator door.

268
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,450
You left something.

269
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:39,970
Wait!

270
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,360
Watch your hands.

271
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,590
I pressed the wrong button.

272
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,140
What did I leave?

273
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,870
This.

274
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,060
That's enough.

275
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,220
Keep your distance.

276
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,640
Aunt Yibai,

277
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,970
may I have a word with you?

278
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,690
Before,

279
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,280
many bad misunderstandings happened.

280
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,360
Actually, that's because

281
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,990
I've never treated someone

282
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,860
like this before.

283
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,339
Don't tell me

284
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,660
Dan is your first love?

285
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,839
Well...

286
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,300
if I did wrong in the past,

287
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,760
I won't defend myself.

288
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:24,849
But in the future,

289
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,510
I hope you can give me a chance.

290
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,520
Give me and Hao Liang a chance.

291
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,260
We'll talk about the future

292
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,210
in the future.

293
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
It should be fine.

294
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,940
Let's go.

295
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,790
Bye-bye, Yibai.

296
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,210
Should I send you back to school?

297
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,410
Aunt Yibai.

298
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,380
What did he

299
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,470
say to you just now?

300
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,660
Ask him yourself.

301
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,060
He's not a bad guy.

302
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,180
I didn't mean to hide it from you, either.

303
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,880
Aunt Yibai,

304
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,990
I just didn't want to make you angry.

305
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
Why would I be angry?

306
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,060
He's not my boyfriend.

307
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,620
What matters is you.

308
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,250
Have you thought it through?

309
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,840
Is he

310
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,860
the person you've been looking for?

311
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,770
Are you ready

312
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,080
to show all sides of you

313
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,480
to him?

314
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,360
What should I do?

315
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,820
Tell him

316
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,820
Dai is you.

317
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
What if he doesn't accept it?

318
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,820
What should I do then?

319
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,640
Then it means

320
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,320
he doesn't deserve your love.

321
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,440
Try to think positively.

322
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,120
Maybe Gu Jiuli

323
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,380
can accept it.

324
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,220
I dare not gamble.

325
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,100
Would you think I'm useless?

326
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,840
Sometimes,

327
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,280
lies get bigger and bigger.

328
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,730
I'm afraid the result

329
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,980
might not be something you can accept.

330
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,700
Dan, you're back.

331
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,280
Dan, come and sit.

332
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,780
Look.

333
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,780
The lobsters from Mr. Chen of another class.

334
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,380
Come on. Let's eat together.

335
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,300
Here's one for you.

336
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,100
I've eaten.

337
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,330
The new album you wanted

338
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,300
is so hard to buy.

339
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,650
Let's listen together.

340
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,660
No, thanks.

341
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,920
Panpan, what's wrong?

342
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,280
Originally,

343
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,700
I didn't want to tell you.

344
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,350
But since you asked,

345
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,670
I'll let you know then.

346
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,510
I want to enter Jiuqian.

347
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,060
Well...

348
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,500
Panpan.

349
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,180
You didn't understand

350
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,520
what I told you last time, did you?

351
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,490
What is it?

352
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,180
Well,

353
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,180
it's about

354
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,860
me being in a relationship with Mr. Gu.

355
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
Dan.

356
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,540
How can you be so ignorant of love?

357
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,520
Love is a science.

358
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,360
Unrequited love and being in a relationship

359
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,840
are two different things.

360
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,780
I'm telling the truth.

361
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,500
During the last club event,

362
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,120
we...

363
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,500
we got together.

364
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,590
The scheme of sowing dissension?

365
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,100
I'm familiar with

366
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,380
that trick of yours.

367
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,300
Dan,

368
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,530
if you don't want to

369
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,930
help me get into Jiuqian,

370
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
I'll do it myself.

371
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,620
Qianqian next door hasn't eaten yet.

372
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,950
I'm not eating with you.

373
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,800
You majored

374
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,970
in Preschool Education at Hudu University?

375
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,660
Yes.

376
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,460
Hao Liang, your former employee,

377
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,290
is my best friend and roommate.

378
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,070
She told me in detail

379
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,910
the content

380
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,200
and nature of the work.

381
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,880
They are all what I'm good at.

382
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,190
I'm confident I can do the job well.

383
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,590
You've always been

384
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,410
the leading actress in the drama club,

385
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:10,900
right?

386
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,950
Well,

387
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,220
because my schoolmates are all modest

388
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,060
and I really like acting,

389
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,870
I've been the leading actress for four years.

390
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,290
When can you start working?

391
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,380
Anytime.

392
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,480
There's a desk over there.

393
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,340
Let me show you.

394
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,700
Thank you.

395
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,860
Well, Ms. Hu,

396
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,740
I have something to talk with you.

397
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,470
You go first.

398
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,470
I'll be right back.

399
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,510
Okay, thank you.

400
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,810
Are you serious, Ms. Hu?

401
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,410
Our R&D Department

402
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,270
doesn't hire girls in principle.

403
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,810
Wasn't that rule

404
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,070
scrapped

405
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,430
after Hao Liang came in?

406
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,280
No, wait.

407
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,710
The point is she didn't even answer the required questions.

408
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,550
And she got in just like that?

409
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,610
Isn't it too hasty?

410
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,650
Mr. Fei,

411
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,620
you are still too young.

412
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,660
Trust me.

413
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,320
If we recruit her,

414
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,580
Mr. Gu will definitely be happy about it.

415
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,420
Mr. Gu's relative?

416
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,780
Is she Mr. Gu's relative?

417
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,860
I have my reasons

418
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,450
for recruiting her.

419
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,200
Panpan.

420
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,590
Let me introduce everyone.

421
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,020
♫Today is a good day♫

422
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,140
♫Everything you want will come true♫

423
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,150
Is your interview successful?

424
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,190
Of course.

425
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:34,890
There's nothing

426
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,020
that I can't handle.

427
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,030
Mr. Gu hired you on the spot?

428
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,200
Yes.

429
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,900
Let me tell you.

430
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,570
When I went there

431
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,680
and handed my resume…

432
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,720
And Ms. Hu

433
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,760
is so cute.

434
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,850
I didn't even say much.

435
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,970
I only told her my name is Yang panpan.

436
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,520
Then, she

437
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,090
accepted me straightaway.

438
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,140
G-Good.

439
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,250
Of course,

440
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,340
Mr. Gu must have told them in advance.

441
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,180
Dan, have you eaten?

442
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,460
I'll treat you to dinner later.

443
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,590
While we're eating,

444
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,520
you can tell me

445
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,060
the questions and details

446
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,130
that I need to pay attention to at work.

447
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,390
I have to perform well.

448
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,980
Thank you.

449
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,970
I'm having a meeting in Songjiang today.

450
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,470
Mr. Gu.

451
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,100
Mr. Gu.

452
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,180
Shi Fei.

453
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,700
Have you printed the material?

454
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,220
Yes.

455
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,410
We'll have a meeting

456
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,340
in the meeting room in ten minutes.

457
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,620
Mr. Gu, I'm here.

458
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,920
Today is my first day at work.

459
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,150
I especially wore

460
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,350
the shoes you gave me.

461
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,320
They are pretty, aren't they?

462
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:55,940
Aren't they?

463
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,700
Yes.

464
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,180
I hired Yang Panpan.

465
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,140
Why?

466
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,730
Mr. Gu, you don't want to hire her?

467
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,480
If the R&D Department wants to hire someone,

468
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,880
my permission is needed.

469
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,790
But this time…

470
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,250
Just let her go when the internship is over.

471
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,940
But last time,

472
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,970
you asked me to transfer money to the drama club.

473
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,360
Last time, that's because I...

474
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,900
Mr. Gu.

475
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,020
Everyone is there.

476
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,240
Is there no problem with the chip?

477
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,830
Later, let's…

478
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,460
This is Mr. Fei's seat.

479
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,980
Can't I sit here?

480
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
Mr. Fei, sit here.

481
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,940
Shi Fei,

482
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,100
Go select

483
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,550
five manufacturers that are qualified

484
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,480
to make Xiaojiu.

485
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,300
Next week,

486
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,630
let's have a field trip.

487
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,100
Okay.

488
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:09,930
C,

489
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,930
run the code

490
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,660
of the engine one more time.

491
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,330
Last night, I found

492
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,190
when it was directed

493
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,210
by some verbal instructions,

494
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,100
Xiaojiu's response speed

495
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,500
is delayed by 0.3 seconds.

496
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Find the bug

497
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,810
and discuss it with me later.

498
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,250
Okay.

499
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,530
Mr. Gu is indeed my leading actor.

500
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,540
He's so handsome

501
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,350
when he works.

502
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,250
Yuan,

503
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,700
how's your hunt for the PR company?

504
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,450
I've visited five or six companies these days,

505
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,020
but none of them were very satisfying.

506
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,510
So, I didn't continue to talk with them.

507
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,500
If you can't handle it,

508
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,730
let Big Mouth help you.

509
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,220
Okay.

510
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,320
I still want to optimize

511
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,530
the program.

512
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,590
It might be helpful

513
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,320
to Xiaojiu's reaction speed.

514
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,750
After it's optimized,

515
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,580
I think

516
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
we should also optimize the program

517
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,670
and see if it will work better.

518
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,450
That is my mug.

519
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,580
I'm sorry.

520
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,240
I'll

521
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,460
wash it for you later.

522
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,380
No need.

523
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,010
He doesn't even mind?

524
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,340
Does that mean

525
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,580
he already treats me as his own?

526
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,900
Ms. Hu,

527
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,330
bring me a new cup.

528
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,480
C, what are you doing?

529
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,370
I'm looking for Mr. Gu for his signature.

530
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,850
I'm looking for Mr. Gu, too.

531
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,290
Let me help you.

532
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,080
No need.

533
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,020
We're all friends. It's okay.

534
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,980
Mr. Gu,

535
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,450
I made coffee

536
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,310
for you myself,

537
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,880
as you're working so hard.

538
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,340
And you need to sign this document.

539
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,700
Where is C?

540
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,950
He...

541
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,060
He's busy with something else.

542
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,100
I want to

543
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,380
share some of their workload.

544
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,170
Let him do his work himself

545
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:14,970
in the future.

546
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,760
Does that mean

547
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,880
he doesn't want me to work too hard?

548
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,340
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

549
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,020
I'm leaving. Bye.

550
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,390
Bye.

551
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,010
Are you leaving, too?

552
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,100
Yes. Let's go together.

553
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,620
Bye.

554
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,450
Bye.

555
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,060
Good luck.

556
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,690
Bye. Come on.

557
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,150
Come on.

558
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,690
I'm a little tired today.

559
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,340
Are you hungry?

560
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,300
Yes, I am.

561
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,960
The teacher was looking for me.

562
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,920
About the photo, I...

563
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,100
I made memes with your photo.

564
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,560
You're not angry, are you?

565
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,940
Let's have dinner together tonight.

566
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm having dinner with my aunt tonight.

567
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,970
I'm sorry.

568
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,620
I have a livestream tonight.

569
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,020
Are you done?

570
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,240
Yes.

571
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,900
Let's go.

572
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,860
We're leaving, Mr. Gu. Take a rest.

573
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,730
Mr. Gu,

574
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,200
Mouth and I are leaving.

575
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,920
Bye.

576
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,770
Bye, Mr. Gu.

577
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,320
Let's go.

578
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,180
C.

579
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,940
Why are you still here?

580
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,010
I'll be done in just a moment.

581
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,500
What is that?

582
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,520
I've never seen it before.

583
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,190
Don't…

584
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,250
Sorry.

585
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,020
I don't understand it.

586
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,640
I just wanted to

587
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,970
ask you about it.

588
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,590
It's okay. I'll teach you next time.

589
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,220
Well, I have something to do, too.

590
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,060
I have to go.

591
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:18,970
You, too?

592
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,570
Okay.

593
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,320
Mr. Gu, I'm leaving.

594
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,650
Thank you for your hard work!

595
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,660
Mr. Gu,

596
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,020
I was just passing by.

597
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,770
I saw your light was still on.

598
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,270
It's so late. You must be tired.

599
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,460
Looks like the perfume I bought

600
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,330
is working.

601
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,700
The seller was right.

602
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,200
It is indeed attractive

603
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,300
to the opposite sex.

604
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,560
Mr. Gu, where are you going?

605
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,640
Mr. Gu, it's so late.

606
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,180
Can you give me a ride home?

607
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:01,940
No.

608
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,110
You didn't drive, did you?

609
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,900
I'll call a taxi

610
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,550
to take you home.

611
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,180
No need.

612
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,520
But it's so late.

613
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,350
Who are you?

614
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,660
Choose between the one you dislike

615
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,950
and the one you hate.

616
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,250
Who are you?

617
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,010
Isn't it obvious?

618
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,940
Mr. Gu, who is she?

619
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,060
Do you smell it?

620
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,590
Men-seducing perfume.

621
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,650
It can make the opposite sex

622
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,850
fall in love with you.

623
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,970
But Mr. Gu already has a girlfriend.

624
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:44,940
Wait,

625
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:45,930
Mr. Gu.

626
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,650
Gu...

627
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,420
Mr. Gu.

628
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,510
You need to remove the source of the trouble.

629
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,940
That girl is not bad.

630
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,210
I didn't see that.

631
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,100
She's pretty.

632
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,940
Really?

633
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,750
She's the campus belle.

634
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,110
You don't like her?

635
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,380
No.

636
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,560
You hired her.

637
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,739
That was a misunderstanding.

638
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,940
When the internship is over,

639
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,820
I'll let her go.

640
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,270
Thank you for today.

641
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,179
It's nothing.

642
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,030
What did that expression mean?

643
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,040
Did he recognize me?

644
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,340
No way.

645
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,310
He has a cross-race effect.

646
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,300
He couldn't have recognized me.

647
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,940
About the photo earlier, I was…

648
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,220
I know you were framed.

649
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,850
I trust you.

650
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,260
Dan.

651
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,150
Mr. Gu.

652
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,180
You go first.

653
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,420
You go first.

654
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,180
I miss you.

655
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,190
That's it?

656
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,920
What do you want then?

657
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
What do you think?

658
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,500
Not enough.

659
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,660
Dan.

660
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,160
What's the matter?

661
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,090
Nothing.

662
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,330
Nothing.

663
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,620
Hello, Mr. Gu.

664
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,780
Shi Fei.

665
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,870
Help me with something.

666
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,600
Mr. Gu is crazy.

667
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,510
He asked me to reduce the trip

668
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,590
from five days to three days.

669
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,100
He just told me to make it a two-day trip.

670
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,860
Work well.

671
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,300
I'll reward you when you're back.

672
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,470
Not enough. I want more.

673
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,870
What are you doing, Dan?

674
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,100
Come on! Come on! Come on!

675
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,820
Zhu Yi! Zhu Yi! You are invincible!

676
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,780
Hudu University has never lost.

677
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,660
Great!

678
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,270
Defense!

679
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,430
Zhu Yi!

680
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,370
Come on.

681
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,410
Come on!

682
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,540
Quick, defense!

683
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,620
Go! Go! Go!

684
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,500
Go! Go! Go!

685
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,280
The team of Hudu University wins!

686
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,860
Zhu Yi.

687
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,220
Great!

688
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,650
Great!

689
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,980
Zhu Yi.

690
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,530
Have some water, Zhu Yi.

691
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:30,980
Dan.

692
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,170
Water.

693
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,010
I've drunk it.

694
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,740
I don't mind.

695
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,620
I'll drink it.

696
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,030
Mr. Gu.

697
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,330
Why are you back?

698
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,620
Didn't you go on a business trip?

699
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
I came back early.

700
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,880
You're haunting us.

701
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,930
Do you want to be beaten up again?

702
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,220
Uncle,

703
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,900
can't you see

704
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,960
whose turf this is?

705
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,410
Isn't this the land of the school?

706
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,000
You just won't admit it.

707
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,170
So handsome!

708
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,330
What do you want?

709
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,460
Do you want to fight in broad daylight?

710
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,260
Take it.

711
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:14,960
Let's go.

712
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,060
Be reserved. What are you doing?

713
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,180
You'll regret what you did just now.

714
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,620
Come on.

715
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,270
Don't worry.

716
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,630
You'll know soon.
