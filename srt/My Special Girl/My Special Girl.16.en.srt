The soy sauce latte

5
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,250
is our signature drink.

6
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,150
It's yummy.

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,760
The coriander ice cream

8
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,570
is the new product of the season.

9
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,630
It sells well, too.

Meteorite Mineral Smoothie

12
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,650
is also a must-have.

13
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,140
How about you two try them all?

14
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,740
-Yes.
-No.

15
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,910
Are these...

16
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,930

It's poisonous.

20
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,850
It's just a metaphor.

21
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,490
A metaphor?

22
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,550
Mr. Gu

23
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,310
seems to really dislike these.

24
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,460
We've ordered so much.

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,710

26
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,260

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,770
Let me try this.

28
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,980
Why are you taking photos?

29
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,750
Look.

30
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,630
Which filter is better?

31
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,290
Is there any difference?

32
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,540
Of course.

33
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,150
"Peach" means orangish pink.

34
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,240

40
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,400
How about I take a photo of you?

41
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,240
Sure.

42
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,290
Use mine.

43
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,040

She doesn't even have one moment of free time.

Won't you seize the chance of having a holiday

106

to take her out for fun?

107
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,860
We seldom have a vacation.

To Sanya.

112
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,320
By then, I bet she'll

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,520
just go shopping in the tax-free stores.

114
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,620
She'll just buy, buy, buy.

115
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,350
Your wife likes to go shopping.

116
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,340
In my opinion,

117
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,170
you should take her there

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,400
before she asks for it

119
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,760
and give her a surprise.

120
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,380
All women

121
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,100

122
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,990

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,950
Didn't I eat with you?

Are you busy?

134
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm just checking the time.

135
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,720
What's wrong?

136
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,919
Look.

137
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,980

139
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,010
She's in a good mood.

140
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,670
Look carefully.

141
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,400
The emoji is Smiley.

142
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,750
There's a heart in the coffee cups.

143
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,500
It feels very sweet.

144
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,590
She told me

145
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,410
she was going to have lunch with her teacher.

146
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,380
Don't listen to her.

147
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,700
What is there to be so happy about

148
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,170
when eating with the mentors?

149
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,370
She even have such a lovely heart there.

150
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,470
Could Hao Liang be with Gu?

151
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,630
Throw away your

152
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,940

153
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,140
All of them.

154
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,670
Expose

156
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,580
But it's cold.

157
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,930
Only old people are afraid of the cold.

158
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,530
This is it.

159
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,390
Okay.

160
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,240
No.

161
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,510
She's on a date.

162
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,980
No, Yibai.

163
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,760
Dan just shared a photo on Moments.

164
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,700
Don't think too much.

165
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,950
Young people are all like that.

166
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,630
Me too.

167
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,360
Don't look at me like that.

168
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,390
I really don't know about anything.

169
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,470
Han Yijie,

170
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,630
I swear.

171
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,520
Dan is 21 years old.

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,720
Are you against her dating?

173
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,800
I'm not against her dating.

174
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,010
I'm afraid she entrusts herself to the wrong person.

175
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,430
Your friend

176
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,070
is good at being mean.

177
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
He has no EQ at all.

178
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,310
That is all a misunderstanding.

179
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,490
Gu is a good man.

180
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,510
I mean,

181
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,620
Dan may not

182
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,520
be on a date.

183
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Even if she is, it doesn't necessarily mean

184
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,940
she's with Gu Jiuli.

185
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,840
Right?

186
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,290
Whether she's with him or not,

187
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,710
I'll know after I sound it out.

188
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,080

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,470
you were with Poor Baby.

195
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,260
Chen Yibai and I are having a meeting.

196
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,120
She's on the phone with Hao Liang.

197
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
What should we do?

198
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,710
Aunt Yibai found out about us.

199
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,820
It's a bluff.

200
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,480
Aunt Yibai, you saw it wrong.

201
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,430
I...

202
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,810
I'm drinking coffee with my classmates.

203
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,810
Didn't you tell me

204
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,430
you were going to have lunch with your teacher?

205
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,870
It's over.

206
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,400
It's over,

207
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,160
so I had a cup of coffee

208
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,190
with my senior.

209
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,900
You had coffee with your senior,

210
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,660
and you posted that the coffee was a little sweet?

211
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,440
Yes, they…

212
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,610
They just add too much sugar

213
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,520
to the coffee.

214
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,240
All right.

215
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,040
I have nothing else.

216
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,280
Thank you.

217
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,080
You're welcome.

218
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Next time, give me, your uncle,

219
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,180
a big red envelope.

220
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,380
I'm going to be rich.

221
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,810
Who are you texting?

222
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,910
Gu.

223
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,070
Give it to me.

224
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,340
You two live together.

225
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,130
Why there aren't any chat records?

226
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,700
Why?

227
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,300
Because

228
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,490
men's talks are all nonsense.

229
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,390
It takes up too much internal storage room.

230
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:52,990
So,

231
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,390
I deleted it.

232
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,420
You think too much.

233
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,770
What does that mean?

234
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,160
I want him to bring me some braised meat.

235
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,930
For you.

236
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,870
Good boy.

237
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,290
I forgot to block my aunt.

238
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,300
I'll post it again after I sort out all my contacts.

239
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,130
Did I sort this one out?

240
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,870
Why are there still 498 friends

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,100
waiting to be sorted?

242
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,320
Did I sort Bao Caixia

243
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,390
just now?

244
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,990
Which category did I put her in?

245
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,890
Forget it. I'm not posting it.

246
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,720
I've photoshopped the photo for a long time.

247
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,560
I registered a new Weibo account.

248
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,310
You can post things here in the future.

249
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,570
Your aunt won't see it.

250
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,520
The account is my phone number.

251
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,350
The password is your birthday.

252
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,410
Am I dreaming?

253
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,410
He specially registered

254
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,760
a Weibo account for me.

255
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,960
Can I post our selfies

256
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,720
on it?

257
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,280
Sure.

258
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,670
Mr. Gu,

259
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,090
You can check it on your phone.

260
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,210
Our first day.

261
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,340
The coffee and you are both sweet.

262
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,620
I'm sorry.

263
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,570
I didn't mean it.

264
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,650
Let me wipe it for you.

265
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,420
It's okay.

266
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,750
How about

267
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,490
I buy you a new jacket?

268
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:46,790
Sure.

269
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,310
Goodbye. Please come again.

270
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,490
Hello, welcome.

271
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,360
Welcome to our fashion store.

272
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,850
We have many of the latest styles.

273
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,750
What kind of style do you like?

274
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,110
I can show you.

275
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,630
This way, please.

276
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,580
When did Mr. Gu

277
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,570
change his style?

278
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,800
This is our most popular shirt of this season.

279
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,260
Would you like to try it on?

280
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,890
Sir, you have such a nice figure.

281
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,069
This crop top

282
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,760
is like it's customized

283
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,819
specially for you.

284
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,040
This shirt

285
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,880
brings out all your advantages.

286
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,099
You have a body proportion that even girls envy.

287
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,510
Buy it. Just buy it.

288
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,609
Well,

289
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,030
do you have anything slightly longer?

290
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,240
You have excellent abs.

291
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,369
Why do you want to cover them?

292
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:24,839
Right?

293
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,210
And the motto of our brand

294
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,740
is to show our personality.

295
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,170
Miss, take a look.

296
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,830
See how good they are.

297
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,870
Well...

298
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,650
Alright then.

299
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:41,950
Okay.

300
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,810
This way, please.

301
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,990
Actually, I think

302
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,240
suits suit you better.

303
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,290
You think so, too?

304
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,870
But

305
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,690
you look good in this, too.

306
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,860
You look good in anything.

307
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,210
What do you think of this one?

308
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,610
This grey jacket looks solemn.

309
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,470
You can wear it on many occasions.

310
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,190
Sir,

311
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
what about this red one?

312
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,240
It's very festive.

313
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,110
It is suitable

314
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,070
to wear on a date.

315
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,780
Sir, you have good taste.

316
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,370
This suit jacket

317
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,160
is the treasure

318
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,640
of our store.

319
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,240
What do you think of this one?

320
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,050
Okay.

321
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,640
Let me see

322
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,460
if I can find some shirt

323
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,500
to go with it?

324
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:40,950
Okay.

325
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,240
I'll pick a pair of leather shoes for you.

326
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,180
Miss,

327
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,440
the coffee stain

328
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,510
on that gentleman's shirt

329
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,970
is caused by you, isn't it?

330
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,360
You must be a real estate agent.

331
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,970
Is that gentleman

332
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,640
buying a house or selling one?

333
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,250
He looks wealthy.

334
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,230
Yes.

335
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,590
He's handsome and rich.

336
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,890
Do I really look like a real estate agent?

337
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,890
Do Mr. Gu and I

338
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,850
really look like

339
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,380
an ill-assorted couple?

340
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,270
This suit

341
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,780
really suits you.

342
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,580
There's no password.

343
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,030
Okay, I'll swipe your card.

344
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,760
I'll pack your clothes for you.

345
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,990
Sir, your card.

346
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,950
These are your clothes.

347
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,930
Are they really a couple?

348
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,780
No way. They're really...

349
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,300
I like

350
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,380
the way you are now.

351
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,390
I heard what they said just now.

352
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,640
You don't have to

353
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,970
change yourself for me.

354
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,740
Just like

355
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,860
I changed myself for you,

356
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:52,870
but you still liked

357
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,750
the way I was.

358
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,750
So,

359
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,700
you dressed like that today

360
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,430
because of me?

361
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,250
No need.

362
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,910
You look good just like this.

363
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,440
Really, I...

364
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,230
You, too.

365
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,280
Let's go.

366
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,660
What's wrong?

367
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,860
Nothing.

368
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,610
Come here.

369
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,080
Wait for me.

370
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,100
Where did he go?

371
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,680
I know.

372
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,530
Wait.

373
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,930
If he wants to take me away,

374
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,210
where is he now?

375
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,310
I know.

376
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,230
It should be like this.

377
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,020
Try them on.

378
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,190
Here.

379
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,560
Come on, Mr. Gu.

380
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,500
You should at least buy a pair of women's slippers!

381
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,700
Plus, they're so big.

382
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,830
What do you think? Do they fit?

383
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,710
Let's go.

384
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,180
Look at her.

385
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,970
Why is she wearing giant slippers?

386
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,700
I don't know.

387
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,260
Look at her slippers.

388
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,120
They are so big.

389
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,760
Yes.

390
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,040
At this time,

391
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,590
normally in idol dramas,

392
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:17,700
♫That kid is afraid of love♫

393
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,670
he should kiss me goodbye.

394
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,920
But why is he so serious?

395
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,610
♫He was defeated by loneliness again and again♫

396
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,360
I don't think he's gonna do it.

397
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,860
We're almost there.

398
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,880
♫That kid also looks forward to♫

399
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,200
He still doesn't show any signs.

400
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,810
Should I take the initiative

401
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,240
and kiss him first?

402
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,550
♫Filling in the blanks of memories♫

403
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,400
♫If you suffer losses in the end♫

404
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,380
Coward Dan

405
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,080
♫You can start again♫

406
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,890
will not be a coward

407
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,870
this time.

408
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,470
I can't let him misunderstand.

409
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,580
Take the initiative.

410
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,260
Coward Dan.

411
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,490
I'm sorry.

412
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,430
Are you okay?

413
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,490
I'm fine.

414
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,900
I lost my footing just now.

415
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,370
I'll go back first.

416
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,870
♫That kid is rewinding the tape♫

417
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,020
♫To look for the amazing moments left by time♫

418
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,310
♫That kid will understand♫

419
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,560
♫To fight against this world, love is♫

420
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,910
Idiot!

421
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,910
♫The gentlest♫

422
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,830
Isn't it embarrassing enough?

423
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,430
♫And the proudest gesture♫

424
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,580
I misunderstood again.

425
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,550
Does that mean

426
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,490
♫I'll be your♫

427
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,180
I can kiss her?

428
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,700
♫Only special girl♫

429
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,070
♫Two eye expressions♫

430
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,380
♫The same passion♫

431
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,680
♫I feel confused while standing on the street♫

432
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,220
♫Where people come and go♫

433
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,190
Where are you used to?

434
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,450
♫But I've never left there♫

435
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,230
♫I am your♫

436
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,490
♫Only special girl♫

437
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,420
Why don't you kiss me here?

438
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,870
♫No one can replace me♫

439
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,960
♫The sorrow of tears♫

440
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,520
♫Turned into a smile, so I just let it go♫

441
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,170
♫And sighed for it♫

442
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,720
What?

443
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,840
Hold on.

444
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,580
Wait.

445
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,400
While I'm away,

446
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,720
you're learning something in secret.

447
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,430
No, I...

448
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,710
I'm learning

449
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,550
the history of kissing.

450
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,730
Learning the history of kissing?

451
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,870
You've been a single programmer for ten thousand years.

452
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,870
Does kissing have

453
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,350
anything to do with you?

454
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,270
Today,

455
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,080
was my niece on a date with you?

456
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,060
Old Virgin. Not bad.

457
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,450
I was wondering why you

458
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,580
suddenly wanted to borrow clothes from me.

459
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,700
It was for today's date with Hao Liang?

460
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,890
Date, date…

461
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Do you have proof?

462
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,610
No.

463
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,360
Then why did you say that?

464
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,020
You...

465
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,690
Is this how you talk to your uncle?

466
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,910
Burn the bridge after crossing the river.

467
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,640
The saying is talking about people like you.

468
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,560
A good dog doesn't block the way.

469
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,020
Go away!

470
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,480
Gu Jiuli,

471
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,690
I'm warning you.

472
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,740
Although you have beguiled

473
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,660
my niece,

474
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,690
her elders

475
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,850
haven't agreed yet.

476
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,380
What kind of elder are you?

477
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,030
Fine, I'll put up with it.

478
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,010
I meant Yibai.

479
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,490
She said today

480
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,910
that it's okay for Hao Liang to be in a relationship,

481
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,780
but she will never

482
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,710
allow Hao Liang to be

483
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,650
with someone like you, who's so inflexible

484
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,580
with no EQ at all.

485
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,960
However,

486
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,680
if you're not together,

487
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,800
you don't have to worry about

488
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,660
Yibai's words.

489
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,180
What else

490
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,910
did she say?

491
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,360
She also said…

492
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,770
it's not important.

493
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
We are together.

494
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
It happened two days ago.

495
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,250
What?

496
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,100
Help me.

497
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,090
How about you burning the bridge after crossing it?

498
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,940
Sorry.

499
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,480
Excuse me?

500
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:47,740
I was wrong.

501
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,830
Louder!

502
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,750
Uncle.

503
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,170
That's right.

504
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,280
As long as you have a good attitude,

505
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,290
I'll help you.

506
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,390
Don't tell Chen Yibai

507
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,870
about this.

508
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,250
Hao Liang is timid and afraid of being scolded.

509
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,850
Give her some time to adjust.

510
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,200
An ugly wife

511
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,750
will have to meet her in-laws eventually.

512
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,570
Fine. I won't tell her.

513
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,470
So,

514
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,820
you were practicing it

515
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,060
for Hao Liang?

516
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,190
You could have asked me!

517
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,860
Let me tell you,

518
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,460
it's normal that I don't know how to kiss.

519
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm different from you.

520
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,630
You're too experienced.

521
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,940
I'm going to teach you,

522
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,040
yet you're attacking me?

523
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,530
Are you going to teach me or not?

524
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,020
Forget it.

525
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,790
You know what?

526
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,750
You have bad breath.

527
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,310
Gu,

528
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,920
You're so cute when you're in love.

529
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,510
Come on.

530
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,490
Tell me

531
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,060
what exactly happened.

532
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,280
Sometimes,

533
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,150
when a girl say no,

534
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,510
she might not mean no.

535
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,110
No means yes?

536
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,310
Right!

537
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,580
This doesn't make sense.

538
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,110
Does it make sense

539
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,790
that you're with Hao Liang?

540
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,200
So,

541
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,710
yes means no.

542
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,940
Bro,

543
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,770
are you saying a tongue twister?

544
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,880
Answer my question.

545
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,730
Yes means yes.

546
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,710
One, two, three, four.

547
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,880
Five, six, seven, eight.

548
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,500
Stop.

549
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,550
Dai, your rhythm is wrong.

550
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:12,660
Sorry.

551
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,760
Let me try again.

552
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,320
It's okay. Go on.

553
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,920
Hello, Mr. Niu.

554
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,350
Hello, Mr. Niu.

555
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:20,920
Let me introduce

556
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,450
our stage director, Jason.

557
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,480
Okay. You guys talk.

558
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,880
Okay.

559
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,370
-You're really professional.
-Long time no see.

560
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,440
I told you.

561
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,490
Only cute Mengmeng

562
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,260
can dance to the song the best.

563
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,830
No.

564
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,470
Everyone danced well.

565
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,340
Everyone knows

566
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,870
this is your favorite song.

567
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,530
Oh right, this is my partner, Dai.

568
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,100
Hello, Jason.

569
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,380
Jason is always like this.

570
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,610
He's very fussy.

571
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,870
Cute Mengmeng is right.

572
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,490
I'm picky

573
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,050
and straightforward.

574
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,820
I saw you dancing just now.

575
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,460
You couldn't keep up with the rhythm.

576
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,690
I will practice more.

577
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,310
I'm very demanding

578
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,040
about the stage performance.

579
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,680
I won't tolerate any flaws.

580
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,270
I'm not worried

581
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,470
about Cute Mengmeng.

582
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,180
But you...

583
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,610
Yeah. Well, Jason.

584
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,440
It's okay.

585
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,570
Dai

586
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,400
is not a professional.

587
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,350
Dancing

588
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,920
has always been her weakness.

589
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,890
She already danced

590
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,950
very well just now.

591
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,310
How about this?

592
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,850
Give her some more time.

593
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,250
If it still doesn't work,

594
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,310
we'll reconsider…

595
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,720
Jason,

596
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,030
there's still some time before the rehearsal.

597
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,590
Give us some more chances.

598
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,940
Yes.

599
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,270
Fine.

600
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,880
Since you both said so,

601
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,050
I'll see you at the rehearsal.

602
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,760
If

603
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,320
you still dance like this by then…

604
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,920
I'm sorry,

605
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,250
but I have to be responsible

606
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:47,980
for my stage.

607
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,830
I'll have to make Cute Mengmeng dance solo.

608
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,550
Okay.

609
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,350
Well, Jason,

610
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,060
let's watch other shows.

611
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,160
Go on.

612
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,600
Bye.

613
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,870
When you form a group with others,

614
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,270
this happens.

615
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,410
Don't give it another thought.

616
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,220
Let's continue.

617
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,420
I won't hold you back.

618
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,130
Five, six, seven, go.

619
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,350
One, two, three, four.

620
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,970
Five, six, seven.

621
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,020
Back.

622
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,230
Down.

623
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,730
Up.

624
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,570
Yes.

625
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,430
Then let's do it faster one more time.

626
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,230
Five, six, seven, go.

627
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,230
That's good.

628
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,720
I need to answer the phone.

629
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,070
Okay.

630
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,300
Hello?

631
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,680
Are you busy?

632
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,750
What's wrong, Mr. Gu?

633
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,020
I bought steak tonight.

634
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,100
Come to my house. I'll cook for you.

635
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,630
Tonight

636
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,670
I have something to do.

637
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,400
Can you turn it down?

638
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,389
I'm going on a business trip.

639
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,850
I'll be away for a few days.

640
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,389
How about

641
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,889
we meet when you come back?

642
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,940
Mr. Gu, I have something to do.

643
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,739
I have to go.

644
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,770
Let's continue.

645
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Do you have something to do tonight?

646
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,150
You are in a bad mood these days.

647
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,920
Take a few days off.

648
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,739
Okay?

649
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,570
Practice harder in a few days.

650
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,900
I'll practice with you.

651
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:47,960
Come on.

652
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,139
You can do it.

653
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,870
Go.

654
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,219
He's waiting.

655
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,470
Okay.

656
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,140
This way.

657
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,520
Make sure the steak is cooked

658
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,040
for her.

659
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,320
Flowers, candles,

660
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,460
cups, plates,

661
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,010
and speakers.

662
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,230
They're all here.

663
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,520
You must also decant the wine

664
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,010
for her.

665
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,300
Got it.

666
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,310
Games.

667
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,190
I just changed two batteries

668
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,170
for the game controllers.

669
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,700
I also bought two new games.

670
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,360
Okay.

671
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,250
Where's Hao Liang?

672
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,230
There's half an hour left.

673
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,560
She should be on the way.

674
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,880
If you don't get my signal,

675
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,280
don't come back tonight.

676
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:47,990
Alright.

677
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,540
I have a date with Yibai.

678
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,100
Although you don't have bad breath,

679
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,050
in order to make Hao Liang

680
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,230
have a better experience,

681
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,700
take it.

682
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,280
The door is open.

683
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,720
Gu.

684
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,570
I don't want this!

685
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,200
The door is closed.

686
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,230
Mr. Gu is cooking himself?

687
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,200
Coward Dan,

688
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,330
perk up.

689
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,780
The door is open.

690
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,590
Thank you.

691
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,810
Aren't you allergic to flowers?

692
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,350
I'm only allergic to roses.

693
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,430
Come in.

694
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,080
The door is closed.

695
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,250
Give me your purse.

696
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,580
Have a seat.

697
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,370
The atmosphere is the detail that is the key to the success.

698
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,830
Even if you're not around,

699
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,610
you have to let your girlfriend feel like

700
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,790
you're with her.

701
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,930
I'll fry the steak first.

702
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,800
It won't take long.

703
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,280
If you're bored,

704
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,790
you can play games.

705
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,060
There's water here.

706
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,520
Pour some water yourself if you're thirsty.

707
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,040
Mr. Gu is so sweet.

708
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,990
He even prepared games for me.

709
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,940
Mr. Gu is so sexy even when he cooks.

710
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,180
He's so handsome.

711
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,190
Let's eat.

712
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Men are controlled by vision.

713
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,930
Women are controlled by emotions.

714
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,710
So candlelight and music

715
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,330
can bring out the atmosphere at critical moments.
