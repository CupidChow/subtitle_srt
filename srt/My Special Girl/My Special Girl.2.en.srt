00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,750
Mr. Gu, your food has been delivered here.

5
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,070
Oh no.

6
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,680
He recognized me.

7
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,190
This is bad.

8
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,750
How should I explain my

9
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,210
double identities to him?

10
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,050
Will he think that

11
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,930
there is something wrong with me?

12
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,470
Thank you.

13
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,270
No.

14
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,320
He...

15
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,990
thought that I was here to deliver food?

16
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,400
He didn't recognize me.

17
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,329
It seems that he couldn't see me clearly that night,

18
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,550
and my face was covered by my long hair.

19
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,620
No.

20
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,210
I ordered the milk tea with full sugar.

21
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,610
But there's only 30% sugar in this milk tea.

22
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,980
I'm... I'm sorry.

23
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,020
Gu Jiuli, your milk tea is here.

29
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,230
where are you going?

30
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,990
I delivered it to a wrong address.

31
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,860
You delivered it to a wrong address?

32
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,460
You work in this shop, too?

33
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,530
You're not from our K11 Shop.

34
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,190
Are you from other branches?

35
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,650
Which branch are you from?

36
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,070
Oh no.

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,350
Which branch is the closest

38
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,540
to this place in the nearby area?

39
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
Stop pretending.

40
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,270
The truth can only be like this.

No.

When and in what situation

did you fall in love with Mr. Gu?

49
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,630
I don't think that's the case.

50
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,020
In my opinion,

51
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,720
she just thinks that Mr. Gu is fat.

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,660

00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,910
I don't think so.

Please help to pay attention to this again.

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,220
Sure.

129
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,510
I've searched this floor.

130
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,020
The owner of the car is not here.

131
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,940
Let's think of another way.

132
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,500
His parents are too careless.

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,620
Let's search each floor one by one again.

135
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,270
There's a kid in the parking lot who is crying

all the time.

137
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,360
He is locked in the car.

Besides, we can't find his parents.

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,660
Just keep searching.

141
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,160
Just keep searching.

142
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,070
I'll be right there.

143
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,340
Just see if there is anyone you know

144
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,870
and ask him to look for the car owner together.

Okay.

148
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,900
Don't beat the skylight so hard.

149
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Stay calm.

150
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,440
Excuse me. Let me take a look.

151
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,460
Where's the kid's mother?

152
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:49,850
We haven't found her yet.

153
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,500
Where's the fire truck?

154
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,159
It's on the way. It'll arrive soon.

155
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,070
Maybe the baby was sleeping

156
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,170
when his mother got out of the car.

157
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,770
Unexpectedly, the kid suddenly woke up.

158
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,750
Everyone, make way, please.

159
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,380
Our property management department

160
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,450
is dealing with the problem.

161
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,600
The clerks of our property management department are also

162
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,710
looking for this child's mother.

163
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,310
Stay calm.

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,390
Have you called the police?

166
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,120
Yes, we have.

167
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,940
But it'll still take about

168
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,450
15 minutes for the fire truck to arrive here.

169
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,050
Where are the kid's parents?

170
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,040
We're searching each floor one by one to look for his parents.

171
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,060
But there are hundreds of shops and companies

172
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,030
in the entire K11.

173
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,690
It's hard to find them so soon.

174
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,760
Open the door yourself. Here.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,550
Kid.

176
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,500
Open the door. Here.

177
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,180
How can he open it himself?

178
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,940
How can he open it himself?

179
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,540
Oh my god.

180
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,100
Sir.

181
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,880
I think this child

182
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,180
is only around three years old.

183
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,620
He has been tied to the Children's Chair.

184
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,100
Well...

185
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,810
Don't cry, Baby.

186
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,350
Come on. Hold my hand.

187
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,270
Hold my hand.

188
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,280
Then you won't feel so scared, okay?

189
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,210

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,780
What are you doing?

192
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,680
What if you hurt the kid?

193
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,940
You'll scare the kid by doing this.

194
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,960
But if the kid keeps crying,

195
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,180
he might throw up, which will lead to obstruction of his respiratory tract,

196
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,840
and it'll be more dangerous.

197
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,000
Mom!

198
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,230
But you still can't use this tool.

199
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,260
What else can we do?

200
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,920
-How dangerous it is. -Right.

201
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,140
This is an electric automobile.

202
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,120
I think it can be

203
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,760
controlled by a computer.

204
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,060
You...

205
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,020
You're the boss of a technology company.

206
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,530
Can you hack into it directly?

207
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,930
Then we can open the door.

208
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,650
I'm... I'm sorry.

209
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,460
I was talking nonsense.

210
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,260
Mom!

211
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,630
Which of you can speak loudly?

212
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,380
Sir, what do you want to do?

213
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,000
If I remember it correctly,

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,540
I once participated in the research

215
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,020
of the AI system of this car.

216
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,780
Man-machine interaction is available.

217
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,740
There's a way like that?

218
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,790
Amazing!

219
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,470
But this gap is too small.

220
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,380
I'm not sure

221
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,380
if the voice can be sent to the center control station.

222
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,750
I can give it a try.

223
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,620
Okay.

224
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,309
What's its name?

225
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,309
Nuomi.

226
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,140
Hi, Nuomi.

227
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,090
Open the skylight.

228
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,630
Mom!

229
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,460
Speak louder!

230
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,490
The kid's crying is louder than your voice.

231
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,820
Hi, Nuomi!

232
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,690
Yes.

233
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,930
Open the skylight.

234
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,280
I'll open the skylight.

235
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,970
It's open.

236
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,090
It's open!

237
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,530
It's really open.

238
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,340
Excuse me.

239
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,140
Guys, excuse me.

240
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,830
Excuse me.

241
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,260
Baby, don't cry.

242
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:08,890
Baby,

243
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,240
I'll take you out, okay?

244
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,640
I'll take you away from here, okay?

245
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,060
Open the door.

246
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,590
Let's go.

247
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
I'll take him out safely.

248
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,900
Calm down, everyone.

249
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,630
She's inside.

250
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,250
Tell me

251
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,790
what your name is.

252
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,280
Bad person. You're a bad person.

253
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,380
Stop crying.

254
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,060
You know what?

255
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,670
Let me tell you a small secret.

256
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,890
Just now, your mom told me that

257
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,690
we were playing hide-and-seek.

258
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,910
Now we're hiding in the car.

259
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,540
Your mom might

260
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,700
find us soon.

261
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,940
I'll take you to hide somewhere else.

262
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,100
Okay?

263
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,190
There's a button here.

264
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
It's unfastened.

265
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,460
So good!

266
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,610
Let me hug you.

267
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,200
Stop crying.

268
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,690
Come on. Make way, please.

269
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,260
His mom is here.

270
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,800
Hao.

271
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,130
Mommy is here.

272
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,700
Hao.

273
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,840
You've suffered a lot.

274
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,660
Hao.

275
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,530
I didn't mean to

276
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,160
let you stay in the car alone.

277
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,430
Come on. Let me look at you.

278
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,800
Mom, you were playing hide-and-seek with me.

279
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,460
I still want to play this game.

280
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,950
Hide-and-seek?

281
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,850
Tell me what you're talking about.

282
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,320
Just now, I told him that

283
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,980
you were playing hide-and-seek with him.

284
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,060
In this way, when he grows up,

285
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,870
he won't have any psychological trauma about this.

286
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,510
Thank you.

287
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,500
You're so thoughtful.

288
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,340
Thank you so much.

289
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,130
Come on. Give this young lady a hug.

290
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,060
Thank you, Miss.

291
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,760
I'm sorry

292
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,320
to have caused you trouble.

293
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,580
It's okay now.

294
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,580
So good!

295
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,270
Thank you.

296
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,150
Thank you.

297
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,280
You're welcome.

298
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,940
So this is the end for my first time

299
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,950
of loving someone?

300
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
Go to the meeting room.

301
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,470
Prepare for the interview.

302
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,560
These are the questions which our company

303
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,760
would like to ask you.

304
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,100
Read them carefully.

305
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,030
Later, we'll also show you

306
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,670
some required questions

307
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,920
on the PPT slides.

308
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,880
Get ready carefully later.

309
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,790
Mr. Gu is coming.

310
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:32,930
Mr. Gu.

311
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,220
Let's begin.

312
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,110
Please briefly introduce yourself.

313
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,480
Hello, interviewers.

314
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,270
My name is Hao Liang.

315
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm a recent graduate who majored in Preschool Education

316
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,230
at Hudu University.

317
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,890
During my school days,

318
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,350
I also got

319
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,310
the CET-4 and CET-6 certificates.

320
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,510
During every summer vacation,

321
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,920
I worked as a tutor

322
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,830
and helped some middle and primary school students study English.

323
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,310
Good.

324
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,410
Sit down and talk.

325
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,390
What do you think

326
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,590
are your strengths

327
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,100
at work?

328
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,860
I...

329
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,460
I can endure hardships.

330
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,720
Does this count?

331
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,700
No, this...

332
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,390
As you know,

333
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,260
we're hiring a micro-expression

334
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,840
collector this time.

335
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,610
Do you have any

336
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,750
individual opinions about

337
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,880
micro expressions?

338
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,710
Does what you did just now count?

339
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,100
What?

340
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,660
The corners of you lips

341
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,140
moved slightly just now.

342
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,050
What does that mean?

343
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,950
It means that you laughed at my answer.

344
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,520
I'm timid,

345
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,020
but I'm not stupid.

346
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,670
It means that my answer

347
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,390
was not very good.

348
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,610
Okay. Let's take a look at

349
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,820
the required questions.

350
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,350
Alright.

351
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,430
Let's look at the PPT slides.

352
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,610
Let's start with the first question.

353
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,100
Isn't this the question

354
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,980
which he gave me just now?

355
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,060
Right.

356
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,220
Read the first question carefully.

357
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,830
When your family is dying,

358
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,860
how will you select some comforting words

359
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,350
from the Internet

360
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,000
and then give feedback to your family?

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,530
Firstly,

362
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,740
I've contacted

363
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,710
the best doctor.

364
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,510
You will definitely recover.

365
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,110
Secondly,

366
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,060
don't give up.

367
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,270
As long as there's hope,

368
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,600
there will be a miracle.

369
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,150
Thirdly,

370
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,750
I'll always be with you.

371
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,040
Is there any problem?

372
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,260
The answer of this question

373
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,280
is not very good.

374
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,700
I won't choose

375
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,350
any of the three options.

376
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,800
Tell me the reason.

377
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,310
At this moment,

378
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,590
language is the most powerless way.

379
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,820
It's useless to say anything.

380
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,120
Then you won't say anything

381
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,300
or do anything?

382
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,290
I will hold their hands tightly.

383
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,780
I can let them feel that

384
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,580
I love them.

385
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,350
Love

386
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,240
can conquer everything.

387
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,460
You don't have to answer the following questions.

388
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,350
I'm sorry

389
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,100
to have wasted your time.

390
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,260
9 a.m. next Monday.

391
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,440
Any questions?

392
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,710
Congratulations.

393
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,780
You're hired.

394
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,680
Have I been hired?

395
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,300
Just now...

396
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,300
Just now, did he shake my hand?

397
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,660
So,

398
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,230
from now on, I'll see him

399
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,600
every day.

400
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,030
Hao Liang,

401
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,350
why are you so lucky?

402
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,220
Mr. Gu,

403
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,030
this is Hao Liang's employment contract.

404
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,890
Please read it.

405
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,540
Has Ms. Hu talked with her

406
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,290
about her salary and benefit?

407
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:16,880
Yes.

408
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,550
She agreed completely and had no objections.

409
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,120
Okay.

410
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,900
What? Is there anything else?

411
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,660
Don't scold me if I tell you this.

412
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,550
Actually, before you came in,

413
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
I showed her the answers.

414
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,230
But she didn't answer the question accordingly.

415
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,670
I told you not to scold me.

416
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,110
You should be glad that

417
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,910
she didn't read the answers.

418
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,780
But Mr. Gu,

419
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,150
today, you didn't judge it according to the explanations from the books, either.

420
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,350
Where was your logic?

421
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,630
It's the fire drill.

422
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,890
Why are you still here?

423
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,210
There's a fire drill at night?

424
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,910
Because in our company,

425
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,690
we always work at night.

426
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,390
The fire station and property management department

427
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,290
changed the time particularly.

428
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:16,819
Let's go.

429
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:17,980
Wait for me!

430
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,490
Oh no.

431
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,550
Let me explain.

432
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,710
What do you want to explain?

433
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,370
Why did you take the elevator?

434
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,090
The fire drill

435
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,500
is a rehearsal for the escape of fire.

436
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,900
If you take the elevator,

437
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,310
what's the point?

438
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,070
I...

439
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,570
Don't you recognize me?

440
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,140
Do we know each other?

441
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,190
The night before yesterday,

442
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,350
I got a ride from you

443
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,150
to K11.

444
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,640
I also added you on WeChat.

445
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,900
But you deleted me from your friend list.

446
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,470
It's you.

447
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,400
You have prosopagnosia.

448
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,110
Right?

449
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,820
You haven't answered my question yet.

450
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,350
Do you have prosopagnosia?

451
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,930
I once watched a TV drama.

452
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,550
The male lead in that drama had prosopagnosia.

453
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,980
Is it true that everything you see

454
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,910
is a mess for you?

455
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,320
Then can you still recognize your mother?

456
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,400
But that male lead

457
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,460
had prosopagnosia

458
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,920
because of a car accident.

459
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,310
Is it the same to you?

460
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,740
I don't have prosopagnosia.

461
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,870
I suffer from cross-race effect.

462
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,140
Then...

463
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,450
is this cross-race effect

464
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,010
the same as prosopagnosia?

465
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,720
Are you very confused

466
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,010
because of this thing?

467
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,460
Can you recognize your family,

468
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,870
friends and colleagues?

469
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,840
We are having a fire drill now.

470
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,150
Can you be serious?

471
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,010
You won't tell me?

472
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,630
Then I'll take the elevator.

473
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,540
Hello.

474
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,020
Do you know

475
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,040
the secret behind your final victory?

476
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,580
I took off my mask and I sang high notes.

477
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,260
Double kill.

478
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,300
Of course not.

479
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,250
You won the championship in the end

480
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,440
because the young master

481
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,010
of the Hua's Group gave his

482
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,170
15%-proportion vote to you

483
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,230
at the last second.

484
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,620
I heard that the technology company on the opposite side

485
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,260
is owned by the young master of the Hua's Group.

486
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,390
Come and have a look.

487
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,950
Gu Jiuli, 30 years old,

488
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,240
graduated from Stanford University.

489
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,670
Dan, I haven't seen you all night.

490
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,800
Where have you been?

491
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,120
Is this given by

492
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,160
that boy from the Architecture Department again?

493
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,900
That boy from the Architecture Department

494
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,270
is all in the past.

495
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,260
One of the bouquets is from a senior student of the Mechanics Department.

496
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,390
The other one is from

497
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,030
someone majored in electrics.

498
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,260
Anyway, neither of them is my type.

499
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
I don't like them.

500
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,820
Panpan.

501
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,270
You are so experienced.

502
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,870
Let me ask you a question.

503
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,100
Go ahead.

504
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,350
I have a good friend.

505
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,900
She has a crush on a handsome guy,

506
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,540
and she

507
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,760
successfully added this boy on WeChat.

508
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,270
She likes handsome guys?

509
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,180
If a girl chases a boy, she's very likely to succeed.

510
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
There's a chance.

511
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,140
But the boy

512
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,690
deleted her from his friend list the next day.

513
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,960
It was courtesy to add her to the friend list face to face.

514
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,690
It means rejection if he deleted her from the friend list secretly.

515
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,520
Tell your friend to get over it.

516
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,380
But that boy

517
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,630
secretly did me...

518
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,020
my friend a big favor.

519
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,700
A playboy.

520
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,030
He's even a high-level playboy.

521
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,780
Then do you think

522
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,970
he likes me...

523
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,690
my friend?

524
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,880
All in all, there's a chance.

525
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,660
But for the specific details of practice,

526
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,920
it depends on the methods.

527
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
There's a chance.

528
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,070
Generally speaking,

529
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,030
when someone talks about a friend,

530
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,140
this friend is actually himself.

531
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,740
No, no, no.

532
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,990
Of course I'm not the girl.

533
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,470
How could it be me?

534
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,220
If it's not you, then it's not you.

535
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,000
Why are you panicking?

536
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,030
I trust you.

537
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,710
Then tell me

538
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,130
what my friend should do.

539
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,970
He played cat and mouse with you

540
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,730
just in order to

541
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,060
confirm your feelings.

542
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,340
To deal with this tactic,

543
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,080
you just need to release the right signal

544
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,370
at the right time.

545
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,460
Then all the problems will be solved.

546
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,670
Yuan.

547
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,230
Come and look at this.

548
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,350
What's wrong?

549
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,260
Look at this.

550
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,900
Let me introduce everyone to you.

551
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,880
The one standing here

552
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,240
is the head of your R&D department,

553
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,010
Shi Fei, or Mr. Fei.

554
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,500
Hello.

555
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,470
Fang Yuan, or Yuan,

556
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,660
is in charge of mechanical engineering.

557
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,100
Jiang Bin, nicknamed Mouth,

558
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,630
is in charge of model design.

559
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,110
Zhao Kai, nicknamed Master Ka,

560
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,250
is in charge of software structure.

561
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,710
Hello, welcome to join us.

562
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
Hello, everyone.

563
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,590
I'm Hao Liang.

564
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,400
You can also call me Dan.

565
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,950
Because I was born on January 1st.

566
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,080
People around me all call me Dan.

567
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,100
C, why are you late again?

568
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,610
You should treat us to dinner tonight.

569
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,750
There was a traffic jam.

570
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,900
Let me introduce her.

571
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,060
This is our new colleague,

572
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,670
Hao Liang.

573
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,470
I remember you.

574
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,860
You didn't look like this that day.

575
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,100
Today, you look

576
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,630
five years older.

577
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,440
What are you talking about?

578
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,260
Actually, we usually

579
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,860
dresses very casually here.

580
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,400
Let me introduce him formally.

581
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,840
Hu Guanxi, nicknamed C,

582
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,350
is your chief programmer.

583
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,430
He's so young.

584
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,830
C went to the Gifted Youth Class in college at the age of 15.

585
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,030
He got a master's degree at the age of 19.

586
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,060
Ms. Hu, get to the point.

587
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,570
Double master's degrees.

588
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,060
Get to the point.

589
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,460
Someone couldn't even wash his clothes

590
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,550
during his first year at the Gifted Youth Class.

591
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,780
His mother specially applied for suspension from her work without pay

592
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,750
in order to take care of him.

593
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,680
How impressive.

594
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,280
You talked too much.

595
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,910
There's a desk here.

596
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,890
You can sit here.

597
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,310
Let me do it.

598
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,510
Well, you...

599
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,430
Give it to me.

600
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,110
How boring.

601
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,260
Hao Liang.

602
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,900
I've added you to the work group.

603
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,730
Pay attention to the messages.

604
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,660
Mr. Gu may release

605
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,500
new information about work

606
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,740
in this group anytime.

607
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,330
Okay.

608
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,270
I don't think it's quite necessary

609
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,290
to make innovation

610
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,440
on this thing.

611
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,710
I'm not

612
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,390
discussing this issue with you.

613
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,450
I've decided on it.

614
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,560
I'm merely informing you of my decision.

615
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,600
Actually,

616
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,550
people from the Hua's Group

617
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,080
came to see me a few days ago.

618
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,150
They told me that

619
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,100
their company would invest in this field

620
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,270
sooner or later.

621
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,750
They can invest in any company,

622
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,780
but it's more reassuring for them to invest in our company.

623
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,260
Shi Fei, how long have you been working for me?

624
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,290
Since I was the special assistant

625
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,950
for the CEO of the Hua's Group,

626
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,270
it's been five years.

627
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,130
Then talk about my shortcomings.

628
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,270
Shortcomings?

629
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,640
Shortcomings...

630
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,390
I'm so rigid,

631
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,070
fussy,

632
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,650
and hard to deal with.

633
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,810
I don't think it's as serious

634
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,420
as you said.

635
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,300
You've been working for me for five years,

636
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,590
but you still didn't tell me the truth.

637
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,910
How could it be possible that the Hua's Group

638
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,210
would tell me their real evaluation opinions

639
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,090
about Xiaojiu?

640
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,760
But if our company

641
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,840
plans to develop

642
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,460
a new operating engine,

643
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,630
firstly, we won't have enough time,

644
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,950
and secondly,

645
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,300
we're not 100% sure that we'll succeed.

646
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,160
Don't worry.

647
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,630
There will be a new employee joining us.

648
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,180
Who is it?

649
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,300
You'll know when that person comes.

650
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,250
Mr. Gu wants to see you.

651
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,260
I'm... I'm sorry, Boss.

652
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,180
I didn't do it on purpose.

653
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,660
What?

654
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,920
Mr. Fei said that you wanted to see me.

655
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
Here's the thing.

656
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,780
Our company and other relevant companies

657
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,470
have bought the database of expressions,

658
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,180
But we still need

659
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,260
artificial collection of the data.

660
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,680
You'll be in charge of this work.

661
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,300
In the next few days,

662
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,780
you can get familiar with the company first

663
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,100
and learn about Xiaojiu.

664
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,760
After that,

665
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,960
you can start collecting data on the street.

666
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,440
Your job is to collect

667
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,780
some micro expressions of humans.

668
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,380
Remember that

669
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,860
before using other people's photos,

670
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,520
you have to get their consent.

671
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,580
Ask them to sign

672
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,190
an agreement for the usage of their portraits.

673
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,590
As for the specific details,

674
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,320
just communicate with Shi Fei.

675
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,830
It turns out that

676
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,940
he wanted to tell me this thing.

677
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,180
Is there any other question?

678
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:44,900
I...

679
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,300
I will work hard.

680
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,220
You can go out now.

681
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,990
Why did you...

682
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,110
pat me?

683
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,290
I didn't do it on purpose.

684
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,760
How do I use this function?

685
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,710
Just double click on the person's profile photo.

686
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,060
No!

687
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,620
[Meimidangka patted me.]

688
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,620
[I patted Meimidangka but then my butt was hit by her.]

689
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,190
It's good.

690
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,180
This kind of interaction

691
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,110
is enlightening to Xiaojiu, too.

692
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,460
Just go out.

693
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,140
It's my first day of work.

694
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,980
How come I didn't control my hand properly?

695
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,580
Excuse me.

696
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,140
Dan.

697
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,420
You are also their fan?

698
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,060
I didn't expect you to have this product.

699
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,770
I'll swap mine with yours.

700
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,470
Come on.

701
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,070
Then... Tell me your price.

702
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,070
No.

703
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,650
It was not easy for me to collect this.

704
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,400
Please.

705
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,340
I'm begging you.

706
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,540
What else do you want?

707
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,940
Everything else is fine,

708
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,350
except for my idol's

709
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,600
merchandise.

710
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:48,970
Hao Liang,

711
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,350
have you decided on the dinner party?

712
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,400
Didn't Ms. Hu tell you about it?

713
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,230
This is the rule of our R&D Department.

714
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,260
As long as there's a newcomer joining us,

715
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,720
we'll have team building.

716
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,620
Besides, the newcomer will order the food.

717
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,890
I'll need to order the food?

718
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,220
I don't know how to do it.

719
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,010
Order whatever you want.

720
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,310
Mr. Gu will pay the bill anyway.

721
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,510
Just order anything that's expensive.

722
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,070
What do you like to eat?

723
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,850
I like...

724
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,430
It doesn't matter what we like to eat.

725
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,290
What matters is

726
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,740
what Mr. Gu likes to eat.

727
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,170
Then what does Mr. Gu like to eat?

728
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:18,660
Mr. Gu...

729
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,990
Mr. Gu likes spicy food.

730
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,380
The spicier it is, the better.

731
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,540
He has to eat spicy food for dinner.

732
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,660
Right, Mouth?

733
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,700
Okay.

734
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,510
I'll book a table now.

735
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,460
You're bullying the newcomer.

736
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,500
Aren't you afraid that Mr. Gu will blame you?

737
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,010
Shut up.

738
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,480
I'll go find Ms. Hu.

739
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,110
Are you ready?

740
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,400
We're going to set off.

741
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,160
Sit tight.

742
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,700
Let me see.

743
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,520
You can order the food.

744
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,850
See what you want to eat.

745
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,860
Mr. Gu likes spicy food.

746
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,420
Boiled fish.

747
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,320
For the boiled fish,

748
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,340
do you want it to be slightly spicy, medium spicy

749
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,470
or extremely spicy?

750
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,050
Just make it as spicy as possible.

751
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,200
Add some coriander to it, too.

752
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,650
I also want a portion of duck blood in chilli sauce.

753
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,170
Fried beef with chillies.

754
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,460
Spicy shrimps.

755
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,700
Hao Liang. Hao Liang.

756
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,480
All the dishes you've ordered are spicy?

757
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,920
Mr. Fei, you don't eat spicy food?

758
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,520
Please have a look.

759
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,840
No, no, no. You can go on ordering the food.

760
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,570
Order whatever you want to eat.

761
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,280
I want a portion of spicy chicken.

762
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,000
Twice-cooked pork.

763
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,710
Mapo tofu.

764
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,940
C, eat more. You're so thin.

765
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,350
Mr. Gu doesn't eat spicy food.

766
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,960
He...

767
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,110
doesn't eat spicy food?

768
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,910
What you've ordered are the dishes he doesn't like to eat.

769
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,530
I'll order something else.

770
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,400
No, thanks.

771
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,840
Are you full?

772
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,500
-Yes. -Yes, yes.

773
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
I'll pay the bill.

774
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,050
You lied to me.

775
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,440
How could you do this?

776
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,960
Because you didn't give me the merchandise.

777
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,400
That was mine.

778
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,810
I begged you.

779
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,980
There are no more than three people

780
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,090
whom I've begged in my life.

781
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,350
How dare you reject me?

782
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,070
You feel wronged?

783
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,570
No, I...

784
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,760
Alright.

785
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,389
Mr. Gu is not that petty.

786
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,469
Besides, the newcomer

787
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,800
had the right to order the food, right?

788
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,600
Yes, yes, yes.

789
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,920
Mr. Gu won't blame you because of

790
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,120
something like this.

791
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,949
Look at Yuan.

792
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,320
He's eating so happily.

793
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,179
I've never eaten

794
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:27,940
such delicious food

795
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,949
at a dinner with Mr. Gu.

796
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,880
It's okay. We all love eating them.

797
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,500
Waiter!

798
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,739
Please pack this duck blood in chilli sauce

799
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,580
for me.

800
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,760
Are you full?

801
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,520
Yes, I am.

802
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,719
Don't look so sad.

803
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,870
It'll be fine.

804
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,110
It was not your fault as you didn't know that.

805
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,370
Mr. Gu won't blame you.

806
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,030
Thank you, Mr. Fei.

807
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,190
Do you want to make up for your mistake?

808
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,920
Just play it by ear.

809
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,420
Mr. Gu.

810
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,830
I don't think you and Mr. Hao are full yet.

811
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,110
Why don't you two go upstairs

812
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,180
to the food center to eat another meal?

813
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,660
I'm not full yet, either.

814
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,900
Let's go eat something again together.

815
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,010
You had two bowls of rice just now.

816
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,960
Hao Liang, you look small but you eat a lot of rice.

817
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,590
Right?

818
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,860
Yes, I eat a lot of rice.

819
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,230
Alright.

820
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,610
Thank you.

821
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,130
Go.

822
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,630
Aunt Yibai.

823
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,190
What should I order

824
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,150
if I want to treat my boss to dinner?

825
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,610
Order some signature dishes.

826
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,590
I must do my best

827
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,510
in order to change my boss's impression on me.

828
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,500
Come on!

829
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,370
Too greasy.

830
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,860
Too dry.

831
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,770
Are there any other options?

832
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,370
Let's take a look at something else again.

833
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,960
Let's go back to work first.

834
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,540
Roasted suckling pigs are too greasy.

835
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,550
Western cuisine is too troublesome.

836
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,140
The Hong Kong style quick meals have been sold out.

837
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,360
What should I do?

838
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,790
Oh no.

839
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,490
I forgot to tell you

840
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,290
what Mr. Gu likes to eat the most.

841
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,420
Please give me...

842
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,500
A cup of sweet-heart strawberry milkshake.

843
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,650
Mr. Gu likes that shop's

844
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,720
sweet-heart strawberry milkshake,

845
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,610
and the limited-sale soufflé

846
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,220
from the next-door shop.

847
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,520
I'm sorry, but there's only one cup left.

848
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,630
-Then give it to him.
-Then give it to her.

849
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,090
How much sugar do you want?

850
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,230
No.

851
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,810
I ordered the milk tea with full sugar.

852
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,390
But there's only 30% sugar in this milk tea.

853
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,070
Full sugar.

854
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:13,680
Okay?

855
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,450
Yes.

856
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,620
Okay. Wait a moment.

857
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,520
Come on, No. 38.

858
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,190
Here's the full-sugar sweet-heart milkshake.

859
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,460
You can drink it.

860
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,400
You ordered it, so you should drink it.

861
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,560
Mr. Gu.

862
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,380
I know that

863
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,980
you don't like sweet-heart milkshake

864
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,950
or strawberries.

865
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,200
Nor do you like full sugar.

866
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,260
But this is the only food now.

867
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,190
Make do with it.

868
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,670
Thank you.

869
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,180
Miss, the straw.

870
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,080
Thank you.

871
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,610
I'm sorry about today.

872
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,540
I mean the spicy food.

873
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,350
It was a welcome party for you.

874
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,610
Of course we should respect your choice.

875
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,540
Besides, if someone needs to apologize,

876
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,800
you're not the one who should apologize.

877
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,540
Did they do

878
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,100
anything else to bully you?

879
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,490
No.

880
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,400
From now on,

881
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:31,960
don't apologize

882
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,220
for what you didn't do.

883
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,780
If they bully you again,

884
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:38,690
just tell me.
