It also contains trans fats.

5
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,020
Eating too many trans fats will make you get fat easily.

6
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,030
It's hard to get rid of trans fats if they accumulate in your body,

7
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,030
especially the abdomen and hips.

8
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,150
It's also not good to eat too much margarine.

9
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,600
You'll become forgetful easily.

10
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,630
Is he saying that I'm not only fat,

11
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,760
but also stupid?

12
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,650
Then I won't eat it. You can eat it.

13
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,470
So I mean,

14
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,170
we can share this cake by cutting it into two halves.

15
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,190
Gu Jiuli, what are you doing?

16
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,070
Dan.

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,240
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

18
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm hungry.

19
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,690
I came out to get some food.

20
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,750
I'm hungry.

21
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,780
Give it back to me.

22
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,580
I...

23
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,500
Why didn't you tell me that

24
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,750
this is mustard?

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,030

26
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,100
Water.

27
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,820
How are you? Are you feeling better now?

28
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,220
Why didn't you tell me that

29
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,470
it was a mustard cake?

30
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,210
I was unable to eat it because you took it, wasn't I?

31
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,990
I should have let him eat it.

32
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,890
Can you walk by yourself now?

33
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,880
No.

Thank you for sending us here.

37
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,730
You live there, right?

38
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,540
I won't see you off then.

39
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,550
Just go back.

40
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,750
Thank you.

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,010
Let's go.

42
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,710
Mr. Gu.

43
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,980
Good night.

44
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,000
Good night.

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,850
What happened?

46
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,420
Just tell me.

47
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,780
Are you sure

48
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,570
you prepared this for me?

49
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,100
Yes.

50
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,090
I helped you create a chance to cultivate feelings between you and Hao Liang.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,600
Are you sure this was not a chance to ruin me?

52
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,260
I didn't expect that Zhu Yi would come as well.

53
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,600
It was something unexpected, wasn't it?

54
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,300
Come on. Take a look.

55
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,210
This is a plan for tomorrow's team building.

56
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,140
Don't you think I'm quite reliable?

57
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,490
You'll show your manliness during the daytime tomorrow.

58
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,430
You'll confess your love to her in front of flowers and under the moon at night.

59
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,760
I'm sure she'll say yes.

60

Don't worry.

61
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,270
Just have a good sleep without worrying about it.

62
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,270
See you tomorrow.

63
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,180
Do you want to predict how many more times

64
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,980
there will be?

65
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,770
There will be two more times.

66
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,820

I want to play it, too.

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,430
I've never played it before.

Why do we have to do the shooting sports

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,460
during our team building?

78
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,450
You asked me? How would I know?

79
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,200
I don't want to do that, either.

Besides,

88
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,300
he seems to have won

Psychologically, his anti-pressure ability

Let me tell you.

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,510
In terms of shooting,

107
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,050
it's all about muscle memory in the end.

108
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,640
How can you establish muscle memory?

109
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,700
You need to practice.

110
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,300
You need to spend time and energy.

Your Mr. Gu and I

115
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,500
often went to a shooting range in America to practice.

Except me,

118

your Mr. Gu

119
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,040
is more than capable of

120

defeating others.

Come on. Take a photo.

Go away. Don't let me hurt you accidentally.

128
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,780
Because life

129
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,140
is always a battlefield.

130
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,120
Oh no.

131
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,870
Mr. Gu has just defeated him in shooting.

132
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,270
He wants to take revenge.

133

00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:44,910
How about this?

136
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,440
I'll let you use three moves first.

137
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,570
If you can hit me down

138
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,880
within three moves,

139
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,520
I'll lose.

140
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,430
You look down on me that much?

141
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,220
C, Mouth.

142
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,030
Ten seconds.

143
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,800
Ready.

144
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,730
If I can't hit you down within ten seconds, I'll lose.

145
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,360
He passed the Level-8 Test in judo,

146
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,660
and owns a Taekwondo black belt.

147
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,360
As for mixed martial arts,

148
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,330
he was even once shortlisted for a professional competition.

149
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,930
It's just like hitting a son.

150
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,710
Zhu Yi!

151
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,870
Don't come over.

152
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,660
Come on.

153
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,570
Do you want to do it again?

154
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,220
Awesome, Mr. Gu.

155
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,690
You didn't even sweat.

156
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,470
Did you show mercy?

157
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,830
You're not sweating,

158
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,030
but we need to sweat.

159
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,310
Come on. Let's continue to practice.

160
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,790
I didn't expect that

161
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,510
I would be tripped by him within just two or three moves.

162
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,930
In terms of athletic performance, I'm even the top student at our school.

163
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,410
It was such a disgrace.

164
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,910
Who can tell me why?

165
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,740
Why?

166
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
Why?

167
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,190
Why?

168
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,040
Why?

169
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,820
Why...

170
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,320
Why is she here?

171
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,660
How are you? Are you feeling better now?

172
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,510
You're still laughing?

173
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,710
I took avenge for you.

174
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,190
It hurts.

175
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,080
Weren't you quite strong before?

176
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,950
I was quite strong.

177
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,240
If he had not used cunning tricks,

178
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,440
I wouldn't have lost.

179
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,720
Let me tell you.

180
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,390
Judging from those two moves,

181
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,010
I think that man

182
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,110
is definitely a bad guy.

183
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,280
There is something wrong with his personality.

184
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,560
He's definitely a man who has the habit of domestic violence.

185
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,780
Fortunately, I've received training in martial arts.

186
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,620
I wasn't seriously hurt by him.

187
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,420
If it were you,

188
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,560
your arms and legs would be broken, and you would be sent to the hospital.

189
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,770
He's not that bad.

190
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,920
He's not bad?

191
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,290
He gave you 36 points.

192
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,610
I'm actually worth 36 points after all.

193
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,390
Compared with him, I'm just not good enough.

194
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,760
Are you stupid?

195
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
Let me tell you.

196
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,190
Luckily, I came here.

197
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,520
Otherwise, you wouldn't know if you had been cheated by him.

198
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,860
This time, I came here

199
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,510
for the sake of

200
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,170
the internship certificate.

201
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,330
I know what to do.

202
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,940
The gap between us

203
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,470
is really big.

204
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,990
You know what to do?

205
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,110
If you knew that, why did you

206
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,790
even eat barbecue with him last night?

207
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,660
I got it.

208
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,910
I won't do it again.

209
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,900
I have a live stream show tonight.

210
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,430
We'll leave here tomorrow.

211
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,950
I don't think

212
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,840
we'll have any association

213
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,310
with each other anymore in the future.

214
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,150
Are you sure?

215
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,520
Zhu Yi is chatting with Hao Liang.

216
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,230
They're quite close.

217
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,220
I defeated him.

218
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,540
Do you think

219
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,620
99 roses are suitable?

220
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,750
According to the time of 9:09,

221
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,310
909 roses

222
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,260
are more suitable, aren't they?

223
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,820
Well, buddy,

224
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,570
do you want to bury

225
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,920
Hao Liang with roses?

226
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm speechless.

227
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,870
You're right.

228
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,470
Hello?

229
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,470
I want to book an outdoor restaurant.

230
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,210
The time is from 9:09 to 10:00.

231
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,110
My surname is Gu.

232
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,040
Good evening, everyone.

233
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,340
This is Ms. Dai again, a Siren female streamer

234
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,420
who is going to

235
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,600
conquer you with beauty

236
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,510
and voices tonight.

237
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,870
Let me spend these wonderful

238
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,740
three hours with you tonight.

239
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,480
I didn't expect that

240
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,860
all of you would be so punctual.

241
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,390
Ms. Dai,

242
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,880
what have you been busy with lately?

243
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,340
Have you taken a good rest?

244
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,540
Yes.

245
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,390
I've received all the concern you showed for me.

246
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,320
What songs do you want to

247
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,270
listen to tonight?

248
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,110
Ms. Dai,

249
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,240
my boyfriend and I

250
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,560
had been watching your live stream show all the time.

251
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,480
We had been watching it since the beginning.

252
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,800
But he cheated on me two days ago.

253
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,260
I'll give you this song,

254
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,950
North Wind.

255
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,360
[There are still 9 minutes before 9:09 p.m.]

256
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:52,970
Why is he calling me

257
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,260
at this time?

258
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,190
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,320
The signal was bad just now.

260
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,250
Let's continue.

261
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,030
A short pause

262
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,860
won't affect

263
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,540
our wonderful time tonight.

264
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,770
It's a special moment now. I'm sorry.

265
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,830
What other songs do you want to listen to?

266
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,870
We can continue.

267
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,550
If you still want to listen to the song I've just played,

268
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,430
then let's...

269
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,720
-Then let's...
-Hao Liang!

270
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,190
Hao Liang!

271
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,720
Hao Liang!

272
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,970
Why is he here at this hour?

273
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,070
Hao Liang!

274
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:22,650
Hao Liang!

275
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,440
Mr. Gu, what's the matter?

276
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,730
Ms. Yibai, is Hao Liang here?

277
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,490
She's talking with her classmate on the phone.

278
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,530
How come she's been talking on the phone for so long?

279
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,660
They're talking about their studies.

280
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,110
Okay.

281
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,750
Then I'll wait for her here.

282
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,820
I'm taking a walk. I'm full now.

283
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,010
Let me show you the scenery here.

284
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,210
It's really amazing.

285
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,500
If there's anything,

286
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
you can talk to her tomorrow.

287
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,580
But

288
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,910
I have something important to tell her.

289
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,900
You can tell me if there's anything important.

290
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
I'll tell her about it later.

291
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,620
Mr. Gu.

292
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,280
Good night, Mr. Gu.

293
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,109
Rest early.

294
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,849
♫The night is falling♫

295
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,089
♫The light is dim, and there are dappled shades on the trees♫

296
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,600
♫I'm used to the air♫

297
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,950
♫It's so thin that it doesn't seem to exist♫

298
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,560
♫Repeating it seriously♫

299
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,680
♫I thought this feeling♫

300
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,380
♫Was all that we had♫

301
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,920
♫Memories gradually found their destination♫

302
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,170
♫They fell on the bottom of my heart and solidified gradually♫

303
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,200
♫Just like that♫

304
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,150
♫They stopped in the lost story♫

305
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,790
♫Who are you waiting for to understand it?♫

306
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,510
♫Just find the map for the answer♫

307
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,760
♫With those gifts from destiny♫

308
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,780
Guys,

309
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,840
there's a piece of surprising gossip news.

310
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,860
Mr. Gu went to see Dan last night.

311
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,790
Mr. Gu is coming.

312
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,910
But Ms. Yibai separated this couple.

313
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,550
Well,

314
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,510
being followed by an elder every day

315
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,560
is really a tricky problem.

316
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,360
What should we do?

317
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,070
How would I know?

318
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,400
But what's the big deal?

319
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,790
No, I understand him.

320
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,900
Sometimes,

321
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,060
female elders are really hard to deal with.

322
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,720
Why is Mr. Fei so experienced?

323
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,970
How was it last night?

324
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,080
How was it going between you and her?

325
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,010
Did you succeed?

326
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,840
How was it?

327
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,130
Did she reject you?

328
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,250
There was no reason for her to reject you.

329
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,270
Mr. Gu.

330
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,070
Mr. Gu, here.

331
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,780
Did you sleep well?

332
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,330
Yes.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,460
You're eating too little.

334
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,150
Sometimes, it's useless

335
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,280
to attack directly.

336
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,470
Especially when you're facing a female elder,

337
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,030
you need to soften your attitudes.

338
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,790
I think what he said makes sense.

339
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,520
For example,

340
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,410
I bought my girlfriend's mother

341
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,140
an advanced

342
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,940
full-automatic massage chair.

343
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,280
She liked it very much.

344
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:36,940
Let me tell you.

345
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,440
This is what the elders like.

346
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,460
It's sold on Taobao.

347
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,270
It's very convenient.

348
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:40,950
Right.

349
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,990
Well, Mr. Gu,

350
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,780
I know you and Yi Bai

351
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,940
are about the same age,

352
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,700
but

353
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,770
she's Hao Liang's elder after all.

354
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,710
If she's Hao Liang's elder,

355
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,940
she's also your elder.

356
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,840
When you're facing a female elder,

357
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,760
I think

358
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,270
sometimes, you still need to

359
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,930
think about how to please her.

360
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,290
Am I right?

361
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,370
Yes, you're right.

362
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,630
Mr. Gu.

363
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,390
Actually, we all saw that

364
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,780
you were kicked out by

365
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Hao Liang's aunt.

366
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,900
Really?

367
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,110
Although Yibai doesn't support you explicitly,

368
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,830
she doesn't

369
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,870
show preference for Zhu Yi, either.

370
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,930
Did you

371
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,280
make your girlfriend angry

372
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,310
without quelling her anger subsequently?

373
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,470
You... Just tell me.

374
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,360
What happened?

375
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,280
They are coming.

376
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,100
Let's go.

377
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:45,950
Let's go.

378
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
You still have to go when you should.

379
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,700
Go for it! Go!

380
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,080
What's wrong?

381
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,730
Do you two want to tell us something?

382
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,830
I don't have anything to tell you,

383
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,360
but he has something to say.

384
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,040
Why didn't you

385
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,980
answer my call last night?

386
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,130
Oh no.

387
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,090
He's still on my blacklist.

388
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,270
I forgot to put him out of the list.

389
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,050
I...

390
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,740
I was talking with my parents on the phone.

391
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,290
Hao Liang is talking with her classmates on the phone.

392
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,620
You talked with them on the phone for three hours?

393
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,240
My mom

394
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,680
nagged a lot.

395
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,190
I didn't remember it correctly.

396
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,950
I thought that she was

397
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,210
talking with her classmate on the phone.

398
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,810
Yesterday, I told him you were talking with your classmate.

399
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,890
Dan, Ms. Yibai, good morning.

400
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,820
Good morning.

401
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,430
Which pervert

402
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,740
put so many roses here?

403
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,880
Dan, roses.

404
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,730
Don't bring them over.

405
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,130
She's allergic to roses.

406
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,070
In this season,

407
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,270
I hate roses the most.

408
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,760
Mr. Gu, don't misunderstand.

409
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,820
I did have something to do yesterday.

410
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,130
It was not convenient for me to answer the phone.

411
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:26,950
Besides, I wasn't talking

412
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,120
with my mom on the phone.

413
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,510
Don't be angry with me.

414
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
Dan, don't panic.

415
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,700
What special reason could he have for talking to you?

416
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,640
He harassed his employee in the middle of the night.

417
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,700
He was up to no good.

418
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,950
Zhu Yi.

419
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,270
What are you talking about?

420
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,820
Her boss called her in the middle of the night.

421
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,300
He must have had something urgent to tell her.

422
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,960
Otherwise, was his purpose to confess his love?

423
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,130
That's right.

424
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,980
My purpose was to confess my love.

425
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,100
Hao Liang.

426
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,120
Gu is serious.

427
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,360
It was May 20th yesterday.

428
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,800
At 9:09 p.m.,

429
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,710
he wanted to confess his love.

430
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,150
He...

431
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,490
wanted to confess his love?

432
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,500
Do you want to say yes or not?

433
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,830
Just tell him directly.

434
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,550
No.

435
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,590
I didn't expect that...

436
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,410
He wants to confess his love to her.

437
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,450
What does it have to do with you?

438
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,510
Kids are not allowed to interrupt when adults are talking.

439
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,440
I like you.

440
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,030
Do you like me?

441
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,990
Dan...

442
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,990
You don't like me?

443
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,680
It's not like that. I...

444
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,480
But...

445
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,150
I like you. You like me.

446
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,610
That's enough.

447
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,950
But what?

448
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,310
No!

449
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,200
If you really liked Dan,

450
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,950
would you have given her 36 points?

451
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,210
What's wrong with you?

452
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,150
36 points?

453
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,070
What 36 points?

454
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,410
Dan.

455
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,880
Tell them yourself.

456
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,210
This is just a misunderstanding.

457
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,780
That day in Mr. Gu's office,

458
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,830
I saw the score of the comprehensive assessment

459
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,960
on a Weighted Matrix of Romantic Love.

460
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,540
He gave me...

461
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,740
He gave me 36 points.

462
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,080
Do you admit it now?

463
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,090
Bro.

464
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,610
Why did you put your things everywhere in your office?

465
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,460
That's true.

466
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,660
But I was following objective principles.

467
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,450
I compared you

468
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,850
with those who once existed in reality

469
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,190
in the world,

470
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,720
and I drew this conclusion.

471
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,020
Indeed, in his eyes,

472
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,380
I'm only worth 36 points.

473
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,620
What kind of weighted matrix was that?

474
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,880
What were the options?

475
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,760
IQ, facial attractiveness,

476
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,110
height, weight and EQ.

477
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,460
How many points did Dan get?

478
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,390
What was the score for her facial attractiveness?

479
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,590
Based on the rankings

480
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,300
of the most beautiful faces

481
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,560
in the world last year,

482
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,770
and compared with

483
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,110
Audrey Hepburn who ranked first,

484
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,550
she got three points.

485
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,040
Well...

486
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,890
What about her IQ?

487
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,650
Compared with Einstein's

488
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,660
IQ of 200,

489
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,960
after the conversion of the scores,

490
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,020
she got two points.

491
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,720
How dare you say that

492
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,520
you like Dan?

493
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:49,990
You...

494
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,170
Don't talk now.

495
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,590
Hao Liang does have many shortcomings.

496
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,920
This is the fact that exists objectively.

497
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,140
But just like my sincere

498
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,800
analysis of all these traits,

499
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,860
my affection for Hao Liang

500
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,310
is also sincere.

501
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,160
I don't understand what you're questioning.

502
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,160
According to you,

503
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:16,840
Dan

504
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,780
doesn't have any strengths, does she?

505
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,510
She surely has some strengths.

506
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,190
Her hair is black,

507
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,840
and she has long eyelashes.

508
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,130
She can use

509
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,810
digital products skillfully to take photos.

510
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,870
She's highly tolerant of spicy food.

511
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,070
She's healthy.

512
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,590
Indeed, in his eyes,

513
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,020
there is still much room for me

514
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,920
to improve myself in all aspects.

515
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,640
Alright.

516
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,890
Gu Jiuli,

517
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,290
I understand

518
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,520
what you mean.

519
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,150
But Hao Liang is still very young now.

520
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,300
The members of her family

521
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
don't quite approve of this matter.

522
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,850
Let's stop

523
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,540
talking about this matter today.

524
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,510
You understand

525
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,610
what I mean, right?

526
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,460
Yes, I understand.

527
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,120
Alright. It's getting late.

528
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,860
We need to go back early.

529
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,140
Let's go back and pack our things.

530
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,900
Aunt Yibai.

531
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,920
Go away.

532
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,750
Let's go.

533
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,120
Yi... Yibai.

534
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,960
She hasn't answered my question yet.

535
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,890
Does it matter?

536
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,360
You insulted her so badly

537
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,870
in front of her family.

538
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,940
You still want her

539
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,340
to answer your question?

540
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,710
I like her.

541
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,990
She likes me.

542
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,400
In this case, we can become boyfriend and girlfriend.

543
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,930
Is there any other problem?

544
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,710
Do you know Romeo and Juliet?

545
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,310
You've folded

546
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,000
this blouse several times.

547
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,030
Well, Dan,

548
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,850
there are

549
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,510
many handsome boys in your school.

550
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,070
How come you have a crush on Gu Jiuli?

551
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,340
He...

552
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,030
No.

553
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,640
What do you mean by saying no?

554
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,210
He didn't give you two points for your IQ?

555
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,710
And he didn't give you three points for your facial attractiveness?

556
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,830
In my opinion,

557
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,410
I think Gu Jiuli

558
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,300
is a bit abnormal.

559
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,430
I...

560
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,720
What do you want to say?

561
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,970
Let me tell you

562
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,330
my attitude today.

563
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,440
If Gu Jiuli

564
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,060
fails to learn to respect you

565
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,740
