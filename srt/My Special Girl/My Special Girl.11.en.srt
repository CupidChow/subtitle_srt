00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
on the Internet.

194
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,590
And a new account

195
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,510
appeared out of nowhere,

196
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,990
and that person bought it without hesitation.

197
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,990
Isn't he or she too stupid and too rich at the same time?

198
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,020
Perhaps he's just rich

199
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,180
but not necessarily stupid.

200
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,380
An album

201
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,460
is just a display one.

202
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,320
It's not for sale.

203
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,450
Everybody knows it.

204
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,310
The management association of the agents

205
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:29,990
is so lousy.

206
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,590
People can make a lot of money

207
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,920
by reselling the album.

208
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,760
How can you be so sure

209
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,220
it's from the association?

210
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,020
Hao Liang and I

211
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,100
are both in their chat group.

212
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,270
Every time a new album is released,

213
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,480
the association

214
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,530
will give it to the members

215
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,930
in the way of a lucky draw.

216
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,600
Don't be so sure about anything.

217
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,350
Maybe

218
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,300
someone gave it to Hao Liang.

219
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,260
Right, Gu?

220
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,380
Who?

221
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,350
Maybe it's Hao Liang's admirer.

222
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,920
Admirer?

223
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,790
Then we can't

224
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,140
agree to this marriage.

225
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,150
Buying a display album…

226
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,020
How stupid could this person be?

227
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,720
We can't watch Hao Liang

228
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,670
jump into the fire pit.

229
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,230
Yeah.

230
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,790
It's up to

231
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,500
Hao Liang whether she jumps.

232
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,890
Give this album back to her.

233
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,300
No, she gave it to me.

234
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,050
Impossible.

235
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,390
But then again,

236
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,310
well,

237
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,670
she's been chasing this idol for so long,

238
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,850
but she stopped being a fan so suddenly.

239
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,760
That's odd.

240
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,230
You don't understand.

241
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,160
A woman's mind is like a deep ocean.

242
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,230
Really?

243
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,750
Where are you?

244
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,110
Hello.

245
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,560
Do you know Hao Liang?

246
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,670
You are?

247
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,550
I'm a police officer from Fengqiao Police Station.

248
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,210
The owner of this phone is at our police station.

249
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,210
[Settlement Room 2]

250
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,830
Please sign here.

251
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,500
The thief wanted to rob you of your camera, and you didn't want to give it to him.

252
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Then he pushed you, and you fainted?

253
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,430
In critical times,

254
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,310
it's better to save your life than money.

255
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,070
First of all, you need to keep yourself safe.

256
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,470
You can ignore the rest.

257
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,360
Understand?

258
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,390
The camera

259
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,510
belongs to the company.

260
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,850
Looks like this camera

261
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,970
is more important than your life.

262
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,470
Don't be like that again.

263
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,550
OK, Miss?

264
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,950
Can I leave now?

265
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,410
Yes.

266
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,040
Sorry for the trouble.

267
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,840
Oh no.

268
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,180
It's no big deal,

269
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,820
but I troubled Mr. Gu for it.

270
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,590
Go.

271
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,230
I'm leaving.

272
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,350
What does his act mean?

273
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,420
Does it mean I can leave

274
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,940
or not?

275
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,020
♫The night is falling♫

276
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,520
That means

277
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I can go now, right?

278
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,420
♫The light is dim, and there are dappled shades on the trees♫

279
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,870
Bye, Mr. Gu.

280
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,300
Get in.

281
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,990
♫I'm used to the air♫

282
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,140
Is Mr. Gu giving me a ride?

283
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,050
♫It's so thin that it doesn't seem to exist♫

284
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,220
Is he free?

285
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,700
♫Repeating it seriously♫

286
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,740
♫I thought this feeling♫

287
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,770
♫Is all that is♫

288
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,810
Where are we going?

289
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,610
To the hospital.

290
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,130
I need to go to Xingbao Kindergarten

291
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,930
to collect facial expressions.

292
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,070
I'm OK.

293
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,590
I really don't need to go to the hospital.

294
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,750
I'm fine.

295
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,040
It doesn't hurt.

296
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,140
No.

297
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,700
You fainted.

298
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,640
You must go to the hospital.

299
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,470
I fainted

300
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,360
because I'm having a period

301
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,540
these days.

302
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,380
But it's too embarrassing

303
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,810
to say that.

304
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,770
I promised the kids.

305
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,460
I can't stand them up.

306
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:37,830
Mr. Gu,

307
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,670
How about I take the bus

308
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,630
to the hospital?

309
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,930
Don't lie

310
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,480
if you don't know how to lie.

311
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,070
Am I so bad at acting?

312
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,430
Mr. Gu,

313
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,990
actually,

314
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,960
it's because it's my time of the month.

315
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,500
What?

316
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:11,910
Oh, OK.

317
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,200
I heard

318
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,730
you gave C an album.

319
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,550
Actually...

320
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,970
Actually, that album...

321
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,830
Mr. Gu.

322
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,930
They are short and short-tempered.

323
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,220
Do you hear it?

324
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,030
What?

325
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,319
The voices in their hearts.

326
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:19,750
Anger?

327
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,460
He is saying

328
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,599
he's lonely.

329
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,530
When I first

330
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,450
started doing this job,

331
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,610
the expression photos I took

332
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,740
always overlapped with the database.

333
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,970
I was helpless.

334
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,190
But after a while,

335
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,690
the overlapping situations became less and less frequent.

336
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,820
That's because I found the trick of it.

337
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,430
Look.

338
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,850
An angry girl in love.

339
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,590
A grumpy mother when educating her kid.

340
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,120
A wife who's criticizing her husband.

341
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,260
In all these expressions

342
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,180
that don't look very pretty,

343
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,430
actually,

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,080
there's the same emotion:

345
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,570
love.

346
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,360
Mr. Gu is in a meeting.

347
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,760
Go inside and take a rest.

348
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,970
Mr. Gu, you're back.

349
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,760
You're here.

350
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
I've run out of pocket money.

351
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,720
How much do you want?

352
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,650
How much can you give?

353
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,470
Did you cause trouble again?

354
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,470
In your eyes,

355
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,900
all I can do is cause trouble?

356
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,700
Ask Secretary Wang for other things.

357
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,130
Let's have dinner together tonight.

358
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,640
Later,

359
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,070
your mom and I have to fly.

360
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,310
Why do people

361
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,110
express their love

362
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,440
with ugly expressions?

363
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,190
Because…

364
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,020
they are afraid.

365
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,590
They're worried they won't get any response

366
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,350
or they will get hurt.

367
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,190
So, Mr. Gu,

368
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,400
Xiaojiu is really amazing.

369
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,030
It expresses

370
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,030
what people want to say for them.

371
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,190
What if we express it

372
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,120
but don't get any response?

373
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,510
It's okay.

374
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,690
Whenever I think of the fact that the person I love

375
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,170
is still alive,

376
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,030
I'll be happy.

377
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,760
Wait, you...

378
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,790
Why were you smashing the backboard?

379
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,510
Did you ask me here

380
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,240
to see you smash the backboard?

381
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,430
Answer the call.

382
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,670
The vibrations annoyed me so much.

383
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,990
Jiuli,

384
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,360
something happened to Mr. and Mrs. Gu.

385
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,590
Mr. Gu?

386
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,350
What do you think

387
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,960
my current expression

388
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,500
means?

389
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,590
You always have a poker face.

390
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,490
Who knows what's on your mind?

391
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,470
Mr. Gu, I want to tell you something.

392
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,310
Well,

393
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,220
I have something to tell you, too.

394
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,830
You go first.

395
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,630
I'll say it after you.

396
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,260
I...

397
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,730
won't come to the company tomorrow.

398
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,150
Sure.

399
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,360
You can have three days off.

400
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,850
No.

401
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,450
I mean…

402
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,470
my internship is over.

403
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,670
I'll make you a regular employee tomorrow.

404
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,790
No, no.

405
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,140
That's not what I meant.

406
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,470
I've learned a lot

407
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,260
during the three months in Jiuqian.

408
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,120
Everyone has taken good care of me.

409
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,930
So...

410
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,860
Mr. Gu, thank you.

411
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,460
This is my internship certificate.

412
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,650
Please stamp it for me.

413
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,050
You're leaving Jiuqian?

414
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,260
Is it because the salary is too low?

415
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,950
No.

416
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,070
Is it because the work is too hard or too dangerous?

417
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,990
I can transfer you to another position.

418
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,110
No.

419
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,510
My family

420
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,190
still wants me to be a teacher.

421
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,010
Wait for me.

422
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,750
I'll give you the hard disk of the assessment

423
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,390
next week.

424
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,090
Old classmate, let me remind you.

425
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,370
The company just finished

426
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,050
the 100-day meeting of the third quarter.

427
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,290
They've decided to

428
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,940
cut some projects and budget in the fourth quarter.

429
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,740
Wait a minute.

430
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,760
[Work Permit]

431
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,200
Mr. Gu,

432
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,660
I have to go.

433
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,930
The handover documents

434
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,020
are on my computer desktop.

435
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,760
Wish you success in your research of Xiaojiu.

436
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,420
Today is

437
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,840
a special day for me.

438
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
I'm going to say goodbye to the past.

439
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,270
From now on,

440
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,620
I'm no longer the old Dai.

441
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,910
I hereby announce

442
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,950
I will be reborn.

443
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,930
Just wait and see.

444
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,420
I'll sing "A Letter Similar to Happiness"

445
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,220
for you all.

446
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,920
♫You shaded my eyes♫

447
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,760
♫Like you did everything else♫

448
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,810
♫A delivered letter went through the cracks of winds♫

449
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,790
♫And lay in your battered desk♫

450
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:04,630
♫You may think of me♫

451
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,000
♫From time to time♫

452
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,900
♫To be honest, I longed♫

453
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,650
♫To be a flying bird hovering in the blue sky♫

454
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,770
♫Just like I shouldn't be♫

455
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,280
♫Your only destination♫

456
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,200
♫Without realizing it, how long has it been♫

457
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:36,570
♫I even remember our parting clearly♫

458
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,990
That's all for today's live.

459
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,850
See you next week.

460
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,280
The leftover tea

461
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,570
should go to the sewer.

462
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,010
The bubbles are household food waste.

463
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,230
The cup and straw are residual waste.

464
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,190
The last bubble

465
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,170
is meant to be thrown away.

466
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,310
You don't remember me again?

467
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,470
Neighbor.

468
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,600
Are you in a bad mood?

469
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,100
Shall we talk?

470
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,750
Are you free?

471
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,940
I'm not.

472
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,390
I left in a hurry tonight.

473
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,290
I forgot to ask Mr. Gu

474
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,150
for the internship certificate.

475
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,170
Mr. Gu,

476
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,290
could you please deliver

477
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,690
my internship certificate to me tomorrow?

478
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,540
I've thrown away the internship certificate.

479
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,470
Mr. Gu,

480
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,360
please stamp it again. Thank you.

481
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,380
What does he mean?

482
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,360
You didn't drive today?

483
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,460
The girl in your company

484
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,130
resigned?

485
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,690
You know Hao Liang?

486
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,390
We're neighbors.

487
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,470
We chatted a little when we were free.

488
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,960
It's good that she resigned.

489
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,430
She majored in Preschool Education.

490
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,890
She's not suitable for your company anyway.

491
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,870
Right?

492
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,950
No.

493
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,500
But there are girls like her

494
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,460
everywhere.

495
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,970
Now that she's left,

496
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,630
you can just recruit another.

497
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,890
Do you know her well?

498
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,400
Yes.

499
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,410
I'm the person

500
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,150
who knows myself the best in the world.

501
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,050
Don't talk about my employees

502
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,180
behind their backs.

503
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,840
I've resigned.

504
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,420
I'm no longer an employee of Jiuqian.

505
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,790
So,

506
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,100
is he going to approve

507
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,030
my internship certificate or not?

508
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,340
I'm counting on you.

509
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,420
The door is open.

510
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,470
Don't disturb me at this critical moment.

511
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,730
Otherwise, I'll break with you forever.

512
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,600
The door is closed.

513
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,080
Okay, it's done.

514
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,830
We were not meant to be together,

515
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,270
but I have plug-ins.

516
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,310
Gu,

517
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,150
your code is really useful.

518
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,100
My new girlfriend is doing a live prize draw.

519
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,130
Be happy for me. Hurry up.

520
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,150
What's wrong?

521
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,010
Something's wrong with you.

522
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,570
Is it because

523
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,460
something happened to Hao Liang?

524
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,520
Hao Liang resigned.

525
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,290
From beginning to end,

526
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,090
I don't think she's ever been into me…

527
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,000
Gu.

528
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,550
It's impossible.

529
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,950
Let me analyze it for you.

530
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,810
-First…
-Please leave me alone.

531
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,940
What does Mr. Gu mean?

532
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,130
Will he really

533
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,610
obstruct my certificate?

534
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,710
Oh no.

535
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,940
I can't graduate

536
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,400
without the certificate.

537
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,969
Silly girl.

538
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,350
You aren't even answering my phone.

539
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,940
Answer my phone.

540
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,670
Why didn't you answer my phone?

541
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,580
Gu,

542
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,810
I think there's some misunderstanding

543
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,909
between you and Hao Liang.

544
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,850
She doesn't reply to my WeChat messages,

545
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,010
nor does she answer her phone.

546
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,520
I think

547
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,080
you need to clarify things.

548
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,670
I just told him

549
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,150
♫Everything seems to go back to the beginning♫

550
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,199
you were just playing hide-and-seek with him.

551
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,270
That way, he won't be traumatized

552
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,630
when he grows up.

553
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,460
I will hold their hands tightly.

554
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,659
Love

555
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:49,290
♫Silence becomes so brusque♫

556
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,449
can overcome everything.

557
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,320
It's also handmade?

558
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:49,370
Thank you.

559
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,639
He's one person

560
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,929
♫Just like that♫

561
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,870
with two distinct temperaments.

562
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:55,639
♫I'm stuck in my own world♫

563
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,830
This is for you.

564
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,470
♫I just realized♫

565
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,630
You said you were under a lot of pressure yesterday.

566
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,430
Hope it can relieve your pressure.

567
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,370
♫The journey that made me meet you♫

568
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,770
♫Was a gift from destiny♫

569
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,890
♫I'm imagining the scene of describing the fairy tale to you♫

570
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,010
♫But the reality is full of thoughts♫

571
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,760
♫They're both complicated and clear♫

572
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,750
♫I'm struggling♫

573
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,080
♫How should I express it?♫

574
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,030
♫I took off the hard armor♫

575
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,880
♫I couldn't hear any extra noise♫

576
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,060
Roger.

577
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,730
♫It was a both complicated and simple♫

578
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,760
♫Conversation♫

579
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:40,590
♫How should I answer the question?♫

580
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,150
Gu?

581
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:44,450
Gu.

582
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,320
Gu.

583
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:50,970
Be good.

584
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,210
Gu.

585
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,900
Cathy called me.

586
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,410
Cathy is President Ma's assistant.

587
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,820
Xiaojiu's financing

588
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,780
was arranged with her help.

589
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,210
So…

590
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,640
She told me

591
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,420
their company wants to reduce the budget.

592
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,880
They're going to cut projects next quarter.

593
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,990
She told me to be mentally prepared.

594
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,810
If anything goes wrong again,

595
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,080
will the capital chain of Jiuqian break?

596
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:41,700
Yes.

597
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Do you have a plan?

598
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,210
Xiaojiu doesn't need a plan.

599
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,950
So,

600
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,650
you're in a bad mood today

601
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,740
because of Cathy's call?

602
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,890
It's not because of Hao Liang?

603
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,690
Don't

604
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,680
ever mention that name in front of me.

605
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,970
Who? Hao Liang?

606
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,360
Last time.

607
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,930
One, two, three, four.

608
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,810
Five, six, seven, eight.

609
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,610
Pull. Hip Swing.

610
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,440
Pull.

611
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,790
Ma'am.

612
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,930
Dai is here to report.

613
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,140
Hello, Dai.

614
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,310
The head office has decided

615
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,450
to make you and Cute Mengmeng

616
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,600
to form a girl group

617
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,990
and perform together.

618
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,540
I look forward to working with you.

619
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,580
Do they have the spirit of contract or not?

620
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,190
They promised the one who had the top popularity

621
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,550
can participate in the Grand Ceremony.

622
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,320
Why did they

623
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,810
squeeze Cute Mengmeng in?

624
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,990
Why?

625
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,560
Because they don't think

626
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,420
you can take control of the stage.

627
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,950
I can.

628
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,680
Then what are you afraid of?

629
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,880
She's unbelievable.

630
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,990
Cute Mengmeng

631
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,140
actually majored in Musical Theater

632
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,400
in an art school.

633
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,340
She didn't even get tired after singing and dancing for an hour.

634
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,540
If you are afraid,

635
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,440
you should

636
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,410
go back to Jiuqian

637
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,500
and work there.

638
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,820
I've already resigned.

639
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,530
Instead of complaining,

640
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,490
you might as well put it into action.

641
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,390
Look at your weak arms

642
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,190
and thin legs.

643
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Strengthen your physical fitness.

644
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,920
They say it's a girl group,

645
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,160
but it's actually a P.K., understand?

646
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,040
Yes.

647
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,720
I'm just developing my mood

648
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,410
for the physical training.

649
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,250
Let it go.

650
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,680
Don't scratch my stuff.

651
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,950
If you're so free,

652
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,670
go and pick someone up for me.

653
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:05,850
Come on.

654
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,550
Be careful.

655
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,350
Hello, Dan.

656
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,280
Jie?

657
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,290
Hao Liang?

658
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,430
Hello, Dan.

659
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,290
Hello.

660
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,430
Why are you here?

661
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,380
This is his personal information.

662
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,370
As soon as you get him, come back.

663
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,710
Love…

664
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,610
It's me.
