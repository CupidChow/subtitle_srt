Why?

5
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,190
It seems that Mr. Gu

6
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,880
can't forgive my deception in the end.

7
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,310

Okay.

If I'm cured,

can you not break up with me?

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,790
You're sick?

14
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,070
What kind of illness?

15
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,140
Is it serious?

16
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,100
What kind of illness is it?

17
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Could it be...

18

I...

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,910
I...

21
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,220
I can't recognize you when you're Dai.

22
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,960
I thought you never

23
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,150
recognized me.

24
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:44,750
But other people

25
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,810
can recognize you.

26
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,420
That's because

27
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,430
you have the cross-race effect.

28
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,400
Just like how I can't really

29
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,760

30
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,440
Why are you suddenly saying this?

Don't you mind?

32

Why?

33
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,830
Why should I care about that?

34
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,230
This is a bug.

35
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,590
No.

36
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,610
I think

37
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,620
it's good that you can't differentiate

38
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,080

39
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,690
It's good?

40
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,060
Then why are you breaking up with me?

41
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,260
You're the one who's breaking up with me.

42
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
You said it first.

43
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:28,910
So,

44
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,540
you wanted to break up with me

45
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,600
because you thought I wanted to break up with you?

46
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,480
Don't even think about it.

You're not angry anymore?

48
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,909
Why should I be angry?

49
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,750
Because

50
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,520

Senior Marco is back in town.

195
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,280
He wants to get together.

196
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,510
We haven't met in such a long time.

197
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,230
Marco

198
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,870
really wants to see you.

199
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,180
10 p.m. tonight.

200
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,380
Du Bar, see you there!

201
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,690
I can't make it today.

202
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,860
I have an important appointment today.

203
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,440
What is it?

204
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,580
Haven't the technical problems

205
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,580
been solved?

206
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,760
At this stage,

207
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,820
what else

208
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,450
could be taking up your time?

209
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,880
It's really important.

210
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,840
Bye.

211
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,870
Hello everyone.

212
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,910
I'm Dai,

213
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,710
a siren streamer

214
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,800
who conquers you

215
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,580
with her voice and beauty.

216
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,710
Hello, everyone.

217
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm here. I'm late.

218
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,340
Here comes Mole.

219
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,470
Making way for Mole.

220
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,190
Mole on the eyebrow?

221
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,770
Where there is Dai,

222
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,770
how can there not be Mole?

223
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,870
Something came up today.

224
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,630
I'm late.

225
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,430
It's okay.

226
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,000
I haven't started singing yet.

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,950
Nothing can stop me

228
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,750
from supporting Dai's streams.

229
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,070
Let's listen to you sing first, Dai.

230
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,990
Sure.

231
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,590
Let's listen to some songs together.

232
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,350
What songs do you want to hear?

233
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,610
Send in your requests.

234
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,610
You're a song in my heart.

235
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,360
As usual, we'll let

236
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,960
Mole pick the first song.

237
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,530
Give it to Mole, we're fine with that.

238
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,280
What do you want to hear then, Mole?

239
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,160
Please sing

240
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,050
"Heart Beats".

241
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,540
I have a request for "Heart Beats".

242
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,710
You didn't give me a hard time this time.

243
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,840
You didn't ask me to sing "Opera No. 2".

244
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,540
I'll sing

245
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,070
"Heart Beats" then.

246
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,260
♫ Spring flowers and autumn moon are hidden in my heart ♫

247
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,290
♫ Writing poems for you ♫

248
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,070
♫ Tenderly and carefully ♫

249
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,330
♫ Rewrite the ending of the past ♫

250
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,510
Gu.

251
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,810
What are you watching?

252
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,510
♫ You appear in my dreams ♫

253
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,510
♫ It's getting clearer and clearer ♫

254
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,230
♫ When the heart beats, one , two, three, four ♫

255
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,090
♫ It starts to tremble ♫

256
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
♫ Composed for you ♫

257
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,770
♫ The rhythm of love ♫

258
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,070
♫ Go to the end of the world with you ♫

259
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,110
♫ And be your companion for life ♫

260
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,380
♫ When every second of time ♫

261
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,390
♫ Becomes precious ♫

262
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,990
♫ Because of you ♫

263
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,270
♫ I know what heartache feels like ♫

264
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,790
♫ Forever and ever is like a dream ♫

265
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,490
♫ I'll still be with you ♫

266
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,750
Love truly is a ray of light.

267
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,320
This is beautiful.

268
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,750
The like button?

269
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,290
It's right here.

270
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,670
The more likes, the more sincerity.

271
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,870
The more, the better.

272
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,150
The more, the better?

273
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,100
Doesn't it hurt?

274
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,550
30,000 likes over two hours.

275
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,280
Is he using a plug-in?

276
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,710
Who is he?

277
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,940
I want to find him too.

278
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,150
This username,

279
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,470
3574890,

280
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,470
I think I've seen it before.

281
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,470
But it also seems to be a new account.

282
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,720
Your boyfriend

283
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,350
came here for validation?

284
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,920
Dai, do you know this person?

285
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,860
Dai, do you know this person?

286
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,280
Let's welcome

287
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,820
our new friend then.

288
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,470
As usual,

289
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,350
new friends can do song requests.

290
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,600
What would you like to hear?

291
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,670
Say yes.

292
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,990
Sure.

293
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,120
Gu,

294
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,080
There's such a thing as

295
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,380
a plug-in.

296
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,800
No.

297
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,450
I have to be sincere with my likes.

298
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,090
♫ You shaded my eyes ♫

299
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,930
♫ Like you did everything else ♫

300
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,950
♫ A delivered letter went through the cracks of winds ♫

301
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,790
♫ And lay in your battered desk ♫

302
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,829
♫ You may think of me ♫

303
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,069
♫ From time to time ♫

304
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:23,109
♫ To be honest, I longed ♫

305
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,260
Okay.

306
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,930
That's all

307
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,020
for today's livestream.

308
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,590
Dai will

309
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,810
see you all next time.

310
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,430
Later, downstairs at K11

311
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,750
a surprise awaits.

312
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,310
What kind of surprise is this?

313
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,510
It's been a night of scares.

314
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,840
I don't want a surprise.

315
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,560
Dai came down personally.

316
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,020
User 3574890

317
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,050
looks very happy.

318
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,950
Why don't you dress like this normally?

319
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
What a pity.

320
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,230
What?

321
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,370
You don't want to be my Uncle anymore?

322
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,000
You dressed like this suddenly

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,180
and you appeared in front of me.

324
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,980
It's a little hard to get used to.

325
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,870
Your fans are too crazy.

326
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,190
Someone was

327
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,190
"drinking vinegar" (feeling jealous) for almost two hours just now.

328
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,520
I can smell the vinegar.

329
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,340
It's Chen's vinegar from 1990, right?

330
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,780
This is your job.

331
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,500
I have to support you.

332
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,030
Hand.

333
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,780
Enough.

334
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,300
I won't stay

335
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,870
and watch you two lovebirds.

336
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,470
I'm going.

337
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,190
You gave me so many likes.

338
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,670
Aren't you afraid to lose your fingers?

339
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,230
What would you like to see

340
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,350
next time?

341
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
What I like

342
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,350
is real life stuff,

343
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,890
not virtual animation on a screen.

344
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,710
So, Mr. Gu,

345
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,950
you don't have to go through all that trouble.

346
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,410
Then I'll

347
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,470
make it happen for you

348
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,880
in real life too.

349
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,350
Does it still hurt?

350
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,560
Yes.

351
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,420
I'm going to remove my makeup.

352
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,030
That's it?

353
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,290
You...

354
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,870
What else do you want?

355
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,650
♫ I'll be your ♫

356
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,970

Wait, you two.

371
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,940
How can we be recognized like this?

372
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,030
Excuse me.

373
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,230
Are you from this building?

374
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,270
Well...

375
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,100
The Qixiu live on the 33rd floor,

376
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,330
is she still there?

377
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,380
Dai's gone.

378
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,180
You two...

379
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,280
You guys know Dai?

380
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,610
Yes, we do.

381
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,270
We bumped into her

382
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,220
in the elevator just now.

383
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,750
She left.

384
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,320
Wait.

385
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,390
Don't tell me

386
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,350
you guys were sent by Dai's rivals?

387
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,120
If she was in the same elevator as you,

388
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,730
we would definitely have seen her.

389
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,100
No one came out.

390
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,510
That's right.

391
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,170
This person is so suspicious.

392
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,490
She doesn't look like a good person.

393
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,840
Just like you,

394
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,350
we really like Dai too.

395
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,190
Are you in the group chat?

396
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,890
What group?

397
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,880
The group name is Protect Dai.

398
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,250
You haven't entered the group yet, have you?

399
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,310
Shall I add you guys into it?

400
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,910
No need.

401
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,670
I have

402
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
an exclusive bonus

403
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,830
from Dai's fan group.

404
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,840
Don't you want to see it?

405
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,620
We're good.

406
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,190
Wait.

407
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,430
Since we're here,

408
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,340
let's join the group.

409
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,040
Don't say sorry.

410
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,010
What?

411
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,710
Are you not convinced?

412
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,000
Are you angry?

413
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,790
No.

414
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,590
You are.

415
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,300
Yes, I am.

416
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,270
But I don't want to say sorry.

417
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,770
Why?

418
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,010
They are my fans.

419
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,750
They made you uncomfortable

420
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,610
but they did it for me.

421
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,210
You are all important to me

422
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,910
and people I love.

423
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,710
Say the last line

424
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,730
again.

425
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,110
It's fine if you don't say it.

426
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
I heard it anyway.

427
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,390
I'm the person you love most.

428
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,470
No.

429
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,220
Am I wrong?

430
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,380
You are.

431
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,950
That's it.

432
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,830
From now on,

433
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,520
you don't have to say sorry to me again.

434
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,410
I...

435
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,830
I wanted to tell you

436
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,770
that you went the wrong way.

437
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

438
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,210
I didn't see Dai tonight.

439
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,450
Here're some of Dai's

440
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,200
an ancient debut photos

441
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,060
to cheer you up.

442
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,660
Mole is really

443
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,860
a Dai treasure trove.

444
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,470
Mole is the one

445
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,950
who loves Dai the most.

446
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,630
Screw her boyfriend.

447
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,030
Dai and Mole are the perfect couple.

448
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,710
It's set.

449
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,110
Hello, Mr. Gu.

450
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,230
Hello,

451
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,350
can you send me

452
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,780
a photo of Dai?

453
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,870
W-w-why?

454
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,740
I...

455
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,110
I want to take a look before going to bed.

456
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,120
An unreleased raw image!

457
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,270
Respect!

458
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,200
What era is this picture from?

459
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,360
I've never seen it.

460
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,110
Why do you look like a fool

461
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,430
once you're in love?

462
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,020
What's so funny?

463
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,350
Show me.

464
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,990
He stalked Dai.

465
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,600
Kick him out of the group.

466
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,380
What is this?

467
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,710
Let me see.

468
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,670
This is what Dai's fans

469
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,140
are saying about you.

470
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,550
Now, if they

471
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,590
know you're her boyfriend,

472
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,460
you'll be...

473
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,070
Envy

474
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,350
is a perverted version of affirmation.

475
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,130
It's useless for them to tear me down like this.

476
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,590
Because that's the truth.

477
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,010
Okay.

478
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,710
What's wrong?

479
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,810
Called you something worse

480
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,890
than a pervert?

481
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,550
Did you

482
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,510
register an account

483
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,840
with my name in the past?

484
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,520
Give it to me now.

485
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,290
That was like 800 years ago.

486
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,030
Why are you suddenly remembering this?

487
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,910
An old account has greater authority

488
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,470
when it comes to hyping posts.

489
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,740
Alright, wait a minute.

490
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,000
I'll coax Yibai first.

491
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,240
She hasn't talked to me for a long time.

492
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:46,920
Hurry up.

493
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,330
Yibai.

494
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,180
I'm sorry.

495
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm really sorry.

496
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,410
I won't do this again.

497
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,540
Please forgive me.

498
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,090
Get straight to the point.

499
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,140
We haven't gone on a date for a long time.

500
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,640
Can you get to the point?

501
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,310
Are you free on Wednesday?

502
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,040
Let's go to the amusement park.

503
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,790
No.

504
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,580
Yibai, I've already bought the ticket.

505
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,300
It'll be embarrassing if you don't go.

506
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,110
You must go.

507
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,970
The number you have dialed

508
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,300
is not available.

509
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,240
Please try again later.

510
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,760
Now my number is blocked too.

511
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,870
It's just an amusement park,

512
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,750
seriously?

513
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,790
Press down.

514
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,570
I can't.

515
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,300
Down.

516
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,020
Harder.

517
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,030
Yes. Relax.

518
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,110
Dai, someone is looking for you.

519
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,270
Mr. Gu!

520
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,150
Jie.

521
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,150
You...

522
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,120
You want to take Aunt Yibai to the amusement park?

523
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,710
I specially arranged it.

524
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,970
As the old saying goes,

525
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,220
if she's hasn't had much worldly experience,

526
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,180
take her to see the world.

527
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,110
If she's been through a lot,

528
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,720
take her to ride the carousel ten times.

529
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,070
Which one of the ancients said that?

530
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,110
Netizens.

531
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,270
Uncle.

532
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,510
You really are

533
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,790
solid evidence that

534
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,370
pursuing girls with online tactics,

535
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,500
is a sure way to fail.

536
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,990
Amusement parks are

537
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,310
a source of trauma for Aunt Yibai.

538
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,330
Whoever enters, dies.

539
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,830
Hello.

540
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,710
Aunt Yibai,

541
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,990
I'm at the amusement park.

542
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,590
My phone and wallet are gone.

543
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,890
Where's Gu Jiuli?

544
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,340
He's not picking up.

545
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,470
Okay, wait for me.

546
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,600
I'll be right there.

547
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,110
How is it?

548
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,500
Jie,

549
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,520
are you sure you want to do this?

550
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,280
Of course.

551
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,280
I'll get going then.

552
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,030
No.

553
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,050
If you leave first,

554
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,780
I'll ask Gu to break up with you.

555
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,790
I'll cut him off before I do that.

556
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,230
Jie,

557
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,930
why are you doing this?

558
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,040
It's his last try.

559
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,830
I...

560
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,960
am making an ultimate move.

561
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,890
Even if I fail, it'll be worth it.

562
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,910
Dan.

563
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,260
How did you lose your phone?

564
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,070
-You came to the amusement park alone?
-Dan, how did you...

565
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,750
Yibai!

566
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,750
Why are you here too?

567
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:02,990
Fate.

568
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,910
Surprise.

569
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,960
We meet everywhere.

570
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,770
Since you're here,

571
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,230
let's have fun together.

572
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,940
Don't go.

573
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,090
Why are you leaving?

574
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,390
You did this on purpose?

575
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,050
We're going to buy something.

576
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
Dan told you

577
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,190
I don't like amusement parks, right?

578
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,120
If she told you,

579
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,310
and you still tricked me here,

580
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,210
what are you trying to do?

581
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,810
Are you trying to provoke me?

582
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,670
Yes.

583
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,450
Do you want to play?

584
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,950
You said it.

585
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:46,950
I did.

586
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,510
We're gonna have a great time.

587
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,290
Are you scared?

588
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,550
How is that possible?

589
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,510
If you're scared,

590
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,370
just shout out.

591
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,710
I saw a guide.

592
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,730
It said that if you shout it out,

593
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,990
you can relieve stress

594
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,830
and fear.

595
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,750
I'm here.

596
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,710
Can you shut up?

597
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:45,730
It's fun.

598
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,900
It's nothing.

599
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,280
I don't want it.

600
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,100
Thank you.

601
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,060
Where is he?

602
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,210
Hurry up, bro. Can you walk?

603
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,270
If you can't, I'll go first.

604
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,870
Move aside.

605
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,800
We still have a ton of rides to take.

606
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,690
I can't walk anymore.

607
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,070
Why are you embarrassing yourself?

608
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,150
Gu.

609
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,250
What are you doing?

610
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:36,960
You making it seem like

611
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,930
I can't stand.

612
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,470
Okay.

613
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,090
Give me some dignity.

614
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,830
Thank you.

615
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,330
Are you happy?

616
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,430
Yes.

617
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,750
I'm so happy.

618
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,480
I love sitting on the pendulum swing.

619
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,080
Exciting!

620
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,870
You said it.

621
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,790
Is it secure?

622
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,350
Yes.

623
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,550
Really?

624
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,030
Are you scared?

625
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,340
Scared? Scared of what?

626
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,360
I can't wait.

627
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,800
Thank you, Dan.

628
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,750
Are you okay?

629
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,870
You're too much.

630
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,670
If you have something to say,

631
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,600
you can tell him.

632
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,219
Aunt Yibai, don't blame Jie.

633
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,100
He didn't mean to provoke you.

634
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,949
Then what was he trying to do?

635
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,320
Is he making fun of me on purpose?

636
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,659
You really misunderstood him.

637
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,920
He came to me that day

638
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,280
and asked me

639
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,730
why you blocked him.

640
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,440
When Aunt Yibai was very young,

641
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:30,909
her parents took her

642
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,110
to an amusement park.

643
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,199
She was really happy that day.

644
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,880
But the next day,

645
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,500
her parents

646
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,020
divorced

647
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,500
and disappeared.

648
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,520
She grew up with my mom,

649
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,870
her cousin.

650
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,040
Since then,

651
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,070
Aunt Yibai feels really insecure.

652
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,030
So, Uncle,

653
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,440
please

654
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,900
don't mention anything

655
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,470
related to amusement parks

656
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,760
in front of Aunt Yibai.

657
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:08,950
Got it.

658
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm leaving.

659
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:13,990
Dan.

660
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,840
You have to do me another favor.

661
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,510
Go ahead.

662
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,550
Take Aunt Yibai

663
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,510
to the amusement park.

664
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,280
J-J-Jie.

665
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,190
Were you even

666
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,070
listening to me?

667
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,590
Yes.

668
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,160
I heard everything.

669
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,060
Then why are you taking Aunt Yibai

670
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,670
to the amusement park?

671
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,960
It's fine that you want to die.

672
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,550
Would you...

673
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,080
Don't drag me down with you.

674
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,110
The way to cure sadness

675
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,160
is to turn sadness into happiness.

676
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,670
I want to cover up her unhappy memories

677
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,170
with happy things.

678
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,710
Dan.

679
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,940
You have to help me.

680
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,930
This is also helping Aunt Yibai too.

681
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,080
Yibai, tell me.

682
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,210
What's the next ride?

683
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,120
Don't worry.

684
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,110
I'm fine.

685
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,550
Even if I have to take another 100 drop tower rides,

686
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,630
I can do it.

687
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,280
Why are you

688
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,510
torturing yourself?

689
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,640
Do you remember

690
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,150
what I told you

691
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,350
when you broke up with Dazuo?

692
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,970
I just want you to

693
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,100
look back on this day

694
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,630
and think it wasn't so bad

695
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,430
because I was there.
