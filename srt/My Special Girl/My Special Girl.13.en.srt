[Episode 13]

4
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,220
I'm rich!

5
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,540
I'm going to buy a car.

6
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,910
I'm so excited.

7
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,130
Mr. Gu.

8
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,720
Mr. Gu.

9
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,500
I can't believe I get to see the living you in my lifetime.

10
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,940
Mr. Gu,

11
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,230
I shouldn't have doubted you.

12
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,870
Enough.

13
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,350
Calm down.

14
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,160
You all

15
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,250
act as if you've never seen the world.

16
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,680
Mr. Gu, can I have your autograph?

17
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,600
I want one, too.

18
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,390
Mr. Gu, sign on me.

19
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,270
Mr. Gu, sign on me.

20
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,090
Sign on my clothes.

21
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,570
Listen to me.

22
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,630
Next,

23
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,090
we'll hold a press conference

24
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,550
to officially launch

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,270
Xiaojiu with the new

26
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,550
engine.

27
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,490
I'll contact the media.

28
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,079
I'll do anything.

29
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,579
I'll go now.

30
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,040
Mr. Gu, I'm going to buy new clothes.

31
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,370
It's time for the official announcement.

32
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,930
One, two, three, four.

33
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,960
Five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,800
One, two, three, four.

35
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,860
Five, six, seven...

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,310
Have a rest.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,710
Thank you.

38
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,660
Madam.

39
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,000
The movements just now were...

40
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,390
In the first beat,

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,310
it felt a bit...

42
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,720
Yeah.

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,420
One, two, three, four.

44
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,790
Yes.

45
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,070
Come down.

46
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,810
Go up.

47
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,190
Yes.

48
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,390
One, two, three, four.

49
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,070
Big news.

50
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,520
You'll never expect that.

51
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,350
It shocked everyone.

52
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,310
Mr. Gu is Infinity.

53
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,240
I really admire Mr. Gu.

54
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,930
Why is there

55
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,310
such a perfect man?

56
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,310
He's handsome, rich, talented,

57
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,040
and low-key.

58
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,420
He's not human.

59
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,030
He's like a deity.

60
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,269
Good.

61
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,880
Okay.

62
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,110
Let's do it together.

63
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,180
Yes.

64
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,410
Okay. Is it like this?

65
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,870
Yes, slow down.

66
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,500
Slow down.

67
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,550
Yes. Not bad.

68
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,150
Teach me.

69
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,900
Those moves you taught us just now.

70
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,390
Dai.

71
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,659
Cute Mengmeng

72
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,320
has a background in musicals.

73
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:35,820
So..

74
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,400
I'll practice twice if once doesn't work.

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,080
If practicing twice isn't enough, I'll practice three times.

76
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,150
I don't believe I won't get it after practicing

77
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,080
a hundred times.

78
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,820
Okay, let's do it.

79
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,100
One, two, three, four.

80
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,710
Five, six, seven, eight.

81
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,750
One, two, three, four.

82
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,150
Five, six, seven...

83
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,780
Pull back.

84
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,920
Good. Not bad.

85
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,260
Let's do it again.

86
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,800
Come on.

87
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,940
Five, six, seven, eight.

88
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,930
One, two... Okay.

89
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,150
That's all for today.

90
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,120
Dai, good.

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,020
Okay, that's it.

92
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,960
Thank you. Madam.

93
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,690
-Thank you. Madam.
-Okay. Bye.

94
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,950
Thank you.

95
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,630
Are you okay?

96
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,280
Not good.

97
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,510
I was almost tortured to death by you

98
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,770
and the teacher today.

99
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,840
I did it on purpose.

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,960
Then I'll rely on you

101
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,750
to intentionally torture me like this every day from now on.

102
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,210
Are you feeling stressed?

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,520
Sometimes I really hate

104
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,940
excellent people like you.

105
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,040
The things I work so hard

106
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,830
to achieve,

107
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,360
you effortlessly accomplish.

108
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,600
But what can I do?

109
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,110
To keep up with you,

110
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,710
I'll do my best.

111
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,220
Do you know what live TV broadcasting is?

112
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,450
There are

113
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,270
various risks, accidents,

114
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,900
and uncontrollable factors during live broadcasts.

115
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,820
That's why

116
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,030
our live show

117
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,160
program lists

118
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
always include

119
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,510
120%

120
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,650
to 110% of the planned content.

121
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,260
In other words, Scream Night

122
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,920
will definitely

123
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,680
cut a few unimportant segments

124
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,360
or move them to

125
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,350
commercial breaks.

126
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,030
So,

127
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,130
only by training our lower limits

128
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,630
to surpass others' upper limits

129
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,600
can we ensure

130
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,750
standing within a 100%

131
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,610
safety margin.

132
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,030
I'm leaving.

133
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,230
Aren't you leaving?

134
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,390
I want to practice the movements we learnt during the day

135
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,320
a few more times.

136
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,660
I'll accompany you.

137
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,870
Take me home.

138
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,350
Don't think

139
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,670
that helping me with the approval

140
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,630
means I won't hold you accountable

141
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,430
for disrupting the livestream.

142
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,180
Well,

143
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,190
then I'll be responsible for finding new advertisers

144
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,310
and doubling the sponsorship.

145
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,710
Okay?

146
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,550
Sure.

147
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,360
Kneel and take your leave. Walk away.

148
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,440
Walk?

149
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,010
It's too tiring.

150
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,180
Give me a ride.

151
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,420
It's not on my way.

152
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,270
Fine.

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,430
If you don't give me a ride,

154
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,950
I'll move tomorrow

155
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,730
to your residential area.

156
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,380
Your new boyfriend?

157
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,350
Get in the car.

158
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,480
You found a new boyfriend so soon?

159
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,290
Or did the backup become the main?

160
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,490
What's the matter?

161
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,500
Now we are even.

162
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,890
He is Mr. Gong's partner.

163
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,230
Just get to the point.

164
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,669
It's about Mr. Gong.

165
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,990
He is

166
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,630
holding onto my graduation thesis

167
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,510
and won't let me pass.

168
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,039
If the thesis doesn't pass,

169
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,390
the company won't let me be a regular employee.

170
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,470
Does this

171
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,780
have anything to do with you?

172
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,550
It has

173
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
nothing to do with me.

174
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,430
Also,

175
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,630
with the quality of your thesis,

176
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,030
do I need to intervene?

177
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,720
If you have time

178
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,950
to argue here with me,

179
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,350
go back and revise

180
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,610
your thesis properly.

181
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,990
You are a woman.

182
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,540
Try not to always speak with force.

183
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,680
If you were gentle,

184
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,300
less harsh,

185
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,950
could I break up with you?

186
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,370
Think about it.

187
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,950
Which of your past boyfriends

188
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,320
could stand you?

189
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,830
Everyone in this industry

190
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,430
knows that your relationships

191
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,360
never last more than three months.

192
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,940
A woman like you

193
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,280
isn't even worthy of having a boyfriend.

194
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,600
Apologize!

195
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,510
Let go of me!

196
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,350
Apologize.

197
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,220
Does this have anything to do with you?

198
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,510
Cut the crap. Hurry up.

199
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,670
Enough.

200
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,320
A partner, right?

201
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,190
Or

202
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,750
did you and him already become together

203
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,010
while you were with me?

204
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,260
Are you crazy?

205
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,530
Let me tell you, this kind of woman...

206
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,170
Where's Dan?

207
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,510
Not back yet.

208
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,810
You're almost looking at my butt.

209
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,350
You have to be responsible for me.

210
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,710
Be serious.

211
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,950
Be gentle. I'm bleeding.

212
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,530
It's done.

213
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,410
Are Zhao Dazuo's hands poisonous?

214
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,030
Why didn't you shout that it hurt

215
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,280
when you hit him?

216
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,470
That's different.

217
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,460
Can I let him bully you?

218
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,900
I have to protect you.

219
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,430
I'm not afraid of anything.

220
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,020
Be gentle. This is my face.

221
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,440
I can't take it anymore.

222
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,870
It hurts.

223
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,630
What should I do? My handsome face.

224
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,060
Let go.

225
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,540
No.

226
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,710
I'm injured.

227
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,150
Let me hug you for a while.

228
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,910
If you don't let go,

229
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,540
how can I treat your wound?

230
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,710
Okay.

231
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,500
Okay.

232
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,470
How about the matter I mentioned earlier

233
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,440
about you being my girlfriend?

234
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,980
Okay.

235
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,800
Failed confession.

236
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,880
I'll start over.

237
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,060
I'm not as good as you think.

238
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,590
Don't say that about the person I like.

239
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,450
Well.

240
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,940
Since I broke up

241
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,770
with Zhao Dazuo,

242
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,170
I've been seriously

243
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,510
reflecting on myself.

244
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,110
I'm wondering

245
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,960
why none of my relationships

246
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,440
last more than 100 days.

247
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,630
It must be my problem.

248
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,360
No, it's not.

249
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,240
Your ex-boyfriends must have been blind.

250
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,020
No.

251
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,810
Maybe I...

252
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,470
I really don't need a man.

253
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,960
Han Yijie, to be honest,

254
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,110
from childhood to adulthood,

255
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,680
my work has been smooth, and life is worry-free.

256
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,160
I do have some savings.

257
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,670
I have a car and a house.

258
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,440
I can change the light bulb by myself

259
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,970
and carry a bucket of water.

260
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,280
People like me

261
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,600
are suitable for being a buddy and a friend,

262
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,510
not for being a lover.

263
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,790
Oh my god.

264
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,850
You took that scumbag's words

265
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,030
seriously.

266
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,190
He just expressed

267
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,670
every man's true feelings.

268
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,160
Really.

269
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,540
Men won't like a woman

270
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,170
who doesn't need them at all.

271
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,210
Okay, stop with the tongue twisters.

272
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,010
You think you can do everything?

273
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,450
Yes.

274
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,180
I'll say something you don't know.

275
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,930
No way.

276
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,930
If you don't know how to do this,

277
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,970
be my girlfriend.

278
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,020
You don't know how to act cute.

279
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,470
I do.

280
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,210
Show me.

281
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,790
Forget it.

282
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,790
I won't force you.

283
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,730
Go to bed early.

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,640
Wait.

285
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,080
I...

286
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,690
Enough.

287
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,990
Say no more.

288
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,750
Don't feel guilty

289
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,570
just because you're excellent.

290
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,450
I'll catch up with you.

291
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,720
Good night.

292
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,430
Are you sure you can make it through 100 days?

293
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,360
It's only been ten minutes since we started dating.

294
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,830
Can you control yourself?

295
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,790
Let me hug you a little longer.

296
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,590
A little longer.

297
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,790
Just a little longer.

298
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,250
Aunt Yibai, I'm back.

299
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
You're back.

300
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,610
Well,

301
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,260
your mother

302
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,050
sent you a package.

303
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,110
I'll get it for you.

304
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,790
You're back, Dan.

305
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,320
Have you had dinner?

306
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,550
If you haven't,

307
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,470
I'll make dinner for you.

308
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,240
Drink some water.

309
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,830
Jie.

310
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,870
Why do you still call me Jie?

311
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,340
Call me in another way.

312
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,740
You should call your aunt's boyfriend...

313
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,390
Uncle-in-law?

314
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,700
Good girl.

315
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,950
Here, Dan.

316
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,550
Take this.

317
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,390
Why are you still here?

318
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,560
Yes, Madam.

319
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,100
By the way,

320
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,750
you know about the new engine, right?

321
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,670
Jiuqian is now

322
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,740
a hot

323
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,850
Unicon company.

324
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,830
Working in Jiuqian is more promising

325
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,030
than being a teacher.

326
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,910
Come back.

327
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,390
Are you leaving or not?

328
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,810
I'm leaving.

329
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,980
Take your time to think about it.

330
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,030
The door of the company

331
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,230
is always open to you.

332
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,870
Bye, baby.

333
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,810
I've been too busy lately.

334
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,920
There are some things

335
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,980
that I didn't have time to inform you.

336
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,440
I've won over

337
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,860
my new girlfriend.

338
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,830
Only similar people

339
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,170
will become family.

340
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,109
Come on.

341
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,690
Call me something nice.

342
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,829
Right.

343
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,329
Now,

344
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,190
you're not my niece's boyfriend.

345
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,190
It's inappropriate for you to call me uncle-in-law.

346
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,369
That's enough.

347
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,770
Alright, I'll stop it.

348
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,609
I have a good idea for you.

349
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,310
With Jiuqian's successful financing,

350
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,839
do we need to organize a team-building event?

351
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,620
During the team building,

352
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,620
when the environment is beautiful and the timing is good,

353
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,420
let me ask you.

354
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
isn't it suitable for a confession?

355
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,480
I've chosen the date for you.

356
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,950
May 20.

357
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,530
9:09 p.m.

358
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,410
Romantic time.

359
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,100
You'll get it in one shot.

360
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,510
She won't come.

361
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,220
Why not?

362
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,290
I'm her uncle-in-law.

363
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,120
If an elder asks her to come,

364
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,240
she has to come.

365
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:00,870
Hurry.

366
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,450
Call me uncle-in-law.

367
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Fine if you don't.

368
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,720
Nephew-in-law, I'll get going then.

369
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,400
I've already resigned.

370
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,430
I have no reason to go to the team building.

371
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,350
Yes, you did resign.

372
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,740
But Gu

373
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,840
didn't stamp your internship certificate, right?

374
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,110
Uncle-in-law.

375
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,190
Are you...

376
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,920
If you don't come to the team building,

377
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,470
he might not have time to stamp your certificate.

378
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,150
Without an internship certificate,

379
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,580
you may not

380
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,510
get your graduation certificate.

381
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,700
Uncle-in-law.

382
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,370
Can you

383
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,200
help me talk to Mr. Gu...

384
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,380
It's true that I'm close with Gu,

385
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,220
but he is the boss.

386
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,290
All right, your aunt will come too.

387
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,270
Can I bring family members?

388
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,400
She's my family.

389
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,250
Thank you.

390
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,970
Call me uncle-in-law.

391
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,060
I'm here.

392
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,230
You just came?

393
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,030
I went to the supermarket earlier

394
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,150
and bought a lot of things,

395
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,080
just in case we get hungry.

396
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,580
If anyone is hungry,

397
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,670
come to me for food.

398
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,290
Fine.

399
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,910
Don't film me.

400
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,310
Fine.

401
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,970
If you feel embarrassed,

402
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,800
you can transfer the money to me.

403
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,560
Mr. Gu.

404
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,320
Mr. Gu.

405
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,690
Aren't we going on a picnic today?

406
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,540
Why are you wearing

407
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,390
a suit?

408
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:02,880
Yes.

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,730
The domineering president

410
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,930
is really different.

411
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,130
When can I wear it?

412
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,800
What?

413
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,140
Are you going to ring the bell

414
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,370
in this?

415
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,810
They haven't arrived yet?

416
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,730
Let's wait on the bus.

417
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,630
Let's go.

418
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,410
Yibai.

419
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,530
You're here.

420
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,060
The luggage is in the trunk.

421
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,920
Gu Jiuli.

422
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,530
Greet her.

423
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,530
Hello, Aunt.

424
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,760
Am I that old?

425
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,190
It has nothing to do with age. It's about seniority.

426
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,470
You're too kind.

427
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,390
You're Hao Liang's boss.

428
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,440
You're also her elder.

429
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,850
Just call me Yibai.

430
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,360
Yibai, you don't know

431
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,830
Gu took good care of

432
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,100
Dan in the company.

433
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,930
To force her to join the team-building

434
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,930
by withholding the internship certificate stamp,

435
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,190
is this considered as taking care of her?

436
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,970
I'll go put away the luggage first.

437
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,170
Wait.

438
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,990
Who is this guy?

439
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,100
Is he her boyfriend?

440
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,240
Well.

441
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,520
Look at Mr. Gu's expression.

442
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,330
You're here.

443
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,950
Why are you here too?

444
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,770
This is an internal team-building for Jiuqian.

445
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,220
Jie, didn't you say

446
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,710
we could bring our family?

447
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,070
What kind of family is he?

448
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,660
Dan and I grew up together.

449
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,380
We are childhood sweethearts and we treat each other like family.

450
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,880
Thank you for your hospitality, Uncle Gu.

451
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,690
You're Dan's boss.

452
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,790
So, you're her elder.

453
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,190
Then you're my elder too.

454
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,250
Nice to meet you.

455
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,930
Let's get on the bus.

456
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,240
Put your luggage over there.

457
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,900
Everyone, look at the camera.

458
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,780
This new friend, say hello.

459
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,760
Master Ka!

460
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,200
What's Master Ka doing?

461
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,260
Can't you see I'm chatting on WeChat?

462
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,540
Mr. Gu. Why do you look unhappy?

463
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,100
I like it.

464
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,250
Look at these two.

465
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,370
They show affection every day.

466
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:49,980
Are you jealous?

467
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,780
You're my colleague. How can you do that?

468
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,340
Look.

469
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,230
What did you bring?

470
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,730
Let me see.

471
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,290
Give me some money for running errands.

472
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,840
Cute Mengmeng is so cruel.

473
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,810
Did you bring the stuff you need

474
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,770
for the livestream

475
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,810
tomorrow night?

476
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,120
I put them in the suitcase.

477
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,060
What are you doing?

478
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,720
-I’m afraid he’ll feel hot since he wears so much.
-Here.

479
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,880
Calm down.

480
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,630
Don't help him

481
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,650
deal with Dandan,

482
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,430
I'll listen to you.

483
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,160
Yibai.

484
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,530
Actually, Gu

485
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,800
really likes Dan.

486
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,010
He likes Dan?

487
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,010
He likes Dan, so she has to endure it?

488
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,740
She has to accept his bullying?

489
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,340
No.

490
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,230
I think you misunderstood...

491
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,160
About what?

492
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,510
Nothing.

493
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,410
I just think a man who is several years older than his wife

494
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,940
would know how to treat her.

495
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,120
Although I'm three years younger than you,

496
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,490
I'm mature.

497
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,660
You can feel it.

498
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:39,850
If Gu Jiuli

499
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,410
really likes Dan,

500
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,070
he must show some sincerity.

501
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,230
What?

502
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,810
I'll switch seats with you.

503
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,640
Why?

504
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,850
I'm carsick.

505
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,380
I need to sit by the window.

506
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,620
Mr. Gu, it's not hot here.

507
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,850
Aren't you dizzy?

508
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,640
Sit down.

509
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,990
Sit down. Sit here.

510
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,050
I also feel carsick.

511
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,510
Uncle, I'm going to sleep.

512
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,260
Mr. Gu.

513
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,490
It may not be by the window,

514
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,500
but it's not sunny either.

515
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,440
You can sit here.

516
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,100
Dan, then I'll come over.

517
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,440
Take a photo with him for me.

518
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,430
What about the diet?

519
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,830
Why are you still eating?

520
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,780
Here.

521
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,410
There are ten rooms in total.

522
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,240
They are located in four villas.

523
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,430
Well, you can assign them freely.

524
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,090
Here.

525
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,230
Mr. Gu,

526
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,460
this is a single villa

527
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,530
for you.

528
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,050
Mr. Gu likes lively places.

529
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,200
It'll be lonely for him to live alone.

530
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,980
Since when did Mr. Gu

531
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,780
-Like lively places?
-Since...

532
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,290
Just now.

533
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,440
Then the three of us will be in one building.

534
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,040
No.

535
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,850
Yes, I don't think so, either.

536
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,360
Why?

537
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,630
Because

538
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,160
you and Hao Liang are classmates.

539
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,210
It's inappropriate for you to live in the same building.

540
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:32,850
Uncle.

541
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,450
We won't live in the same room.

542
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,110
Aren't you too conservative?

543
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,520
I think

544
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,650
I'm more suitable.

545
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,320
I'm Yibai's boyfriend.

546
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,170
-I'm also Hao Liang's...
-Han Yijie, you are not suitable.

547
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:53,810
Yes.

548
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,040
I can live in that single
villa myself.

549
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,120
Distance creates beauty.

550
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,180
It's decided then.

551
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,360
Why don't we draw lots to decide?

552
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,250
Okay.

553
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,840
Okay.

554
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,680
Let's draw lots.

555
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,770
That's the fairest.

556
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,360
Come on. It's the fairest.

557
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,840
Come on.

558
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,090
How is it?

559
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,400
Not bad.

560
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,740
Ladies first.

561
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,200
Here.

562
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,330
Mr. Gu.

563
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,480
Master Ka.

564
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,290
Leave this to me.

565
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,190
The fourth villa

566
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,090
is on the most remote mountain.

567
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,440
It's very quiet.

568
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,130
Owen is lucky.

569
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,090
Yes, very quiet.

570
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,090
Don't worry.

571
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,370
If there's nothing else,

572
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,780
we won't disturb you.

573
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,920
Mr. Gu.

574
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,840
Mr. Gu.

575
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,430
Let's switch rooms.

576
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,550
Don't worry.

577
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,200
C promised me

578
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,880
that she would be here.

579
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,540
Get ready

580
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,690
to create an atmosphere for May, 20th.

581
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,940
Mr. Gu, she's here.

582
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,180
-But...
-Good brother.

583
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,260
Alright.

584
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,440
I didn't expect there to be karaoke here.

585
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,080
Dan.

586
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:30,790
Mr. Gu.

587
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,330
Uncle Gu. Thank you for your hospitality.

588
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,200
We'll sing a song

589
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,560
for you later.

590
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,480
Let's go.

591
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,200
Are you afraid of him? Let’s go.

592
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,730
Mr. Fei, stop filming.

593
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,970
Are the skewers ready, Mr. Fei?

594
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,500
Let’s go.

595
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,320
Is it okay?

596
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:58,840
Mr. Gu.

597
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,000
What song should I choose?

598
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,440
Mr. Gu.

599
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,230
The skewers are almost ready.

600
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,330
Let me choose some songs.

601
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:03,770
Me too.

602
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,840
It's roasted.

603
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,760
Have you finished finished selecting songs?

604
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,250
Wait.

605
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,970
Is it okay?

606
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,020
Serve the dishes.

607
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,690
I want this.

608
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,680
Here.

609
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,500
The squid is ready.

610
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,360
I'm going to sing this song later.

611
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,960
Two skewers. Help yourself.

612
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,490
Mr. Gu.

613
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,220
I'm going to eat.

614
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,680
Mr. Gu, do you want to sing?

615
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,450
Let me select songs for you.

616
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,910
Two more skewers are here.

617
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:22,670
Thank you.

618
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,720
This place is nice.

619
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:23,980
Here.

620
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,770
The environment is good too.

621
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,680
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

622
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,120
Dan.

623
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,260
Shall we choose the song

624
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,000
with the sound of gunfire?

625
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,730
Gunfire?

626
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,580
Gunfire.

627
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,050
Mr. Gu.

628
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,750
Can you help us to select

629
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,560
Blink's songs?

630
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,840
Which Blink?

631
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,120
Blink

632
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,520
is something that we youngsters

633
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,580
might know better.

634
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,090
Let me help you.

635
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,580
Come on.

636
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,090
Mutton skewers. Mutton skewers.

637
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,420
Eat it while it's hot.

638
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,610
Dan.

639
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,380
Our song.

640
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,660
-Come on.
-Aunt Yibai.

641
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,460
Come on.

642
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,370
♫Looking at the screen♫

643
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,870

♫The one who rushes towards me♫

650
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,940
You two coordinate so well.

651
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,090
Who are you referring to?

652
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,770
Hao Liang and her childhood sweetheart.

653
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,210
♫Don't slack off♫

654
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,330

talking nonsense?

663
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,360
Just

664
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
eat your skewers.

665
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,210

They sing so well.

672
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,250
They are a perfect match.

673
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,200

you've changed.

700
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,740
As for Chen Yibai...

701
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,440
She doesn't want me to help you.

702
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,560
What a loser.

703
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,440
Me loser?

704
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,930
Which of us was defeated

Give me the drink.

712
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,940
I already sang.

713
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,680
Mr. Gu, you sing.

714
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,840
Who selected this?

715
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,850
It's so old-fashioned.

716
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,410
I did.

717
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,100
You're so good, Mr. Gu.

718
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,300
You have a good taste.

719
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,510
This song is a duet.

720
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,040
I know how to sing it. Let me.

What's wrong?

728
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,410
I seem to

729
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,820
have heard this voice somewhere.

730
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,010
Baby,

731
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,090
I just watched a video.

732
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,570
It's very funny.

733
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,760
Look at this.

734
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,580
Isn't it funny?

735
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,250
It's funny.

736
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,770
Mr. Gu, let me toast you.

737
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,440
What's going on?

738
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,210
What are you doing?

739
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,010
Calm down.

740
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,560
I...

741
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,730
I didn't mean it.

742
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,360
Mr. Gu, he's drunk.

743
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,710
Go.

744
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,580
It's late. It's time to go back to sleep.

745
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,040
Dan, it's time for beauty sleep.

746
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,630
No, Yuan, don't pull me.

747
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,010
Don't move.

748
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,040
I'm telling you, today I...

749
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:03,720
Put it down.

750
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Put it down.

751
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,810
What are you doing?

752
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,610
Are you drunk?

753
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,760
Luckily, you're here too.

754
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,310
If you keep singing,

755
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,540
Han Yijie will know

756
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,720
you are Dai.

757
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,060
Logically,

758
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,760
you wear a mask during live streaming.

759
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,690
And your makeup

760
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,800
covers your true look.

761
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,730
I don't think he can recognize you.

762
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,800
The livestream tomorrow night...

763
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,740
You have me. Don't worry.

764
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,360
There's no signal.

765
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,610
They can't hear you.

766
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,630
Let's go.

767
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,720
What are you doing?

768
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,410
Mr. Gu, why are you here?

769
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,820
I'm hungry.

770
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
I'm looking for food.

771
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,760
There's only

772
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,050
this piece of cake left.

773
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,760
You can have it.

774
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,050
The average sugar content of each 100 grams of cake

775
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,720
is

776
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,330
19.5 grams.

777
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,490
19.5...

778
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,840
This cake

779
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,980
is equivalent to ten sugar cubes.

780
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,240
It also contains trans fats.

781
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,420
Eating too much makes you fat.

782
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,520
Fat accumulation in the body is difficult to eliminate,

783
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,520
especially in the abdominal and hip areas.

784
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,710
It's not good to eat too much artificial cream.

785
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,510
You'll lose your memory easily.

786
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,640
Is he saying that I'm not only fat

787
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,750
but also stupid?
