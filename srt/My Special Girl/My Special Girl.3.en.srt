anything else to bully you?

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,700
No.

don't apologize

for what you didn't do.

Hello, sir. What would you like?

Maybe just like you,

he also suffers from the cross-race effect.

40
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,810
The cross-race effect isn't the same as prosopagnosia.

41
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,030
It also doesn't mean being blind.

42
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,070
It's about perceptual narrowing

According to my analysis,

72
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,900
I don't think it's appropriate to use

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,350

push him down directly.

76
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,640
I should push him down directly?

77
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,440
I've seen through your tricks.

78
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,830
You deliberately ignored me

79
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,160
because you wanted to stimulate my desire to win.

80
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,450

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300

87
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,470
I'm giving it to you.

88
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,900
I'm a data collector

89

from Jiuqian Technology.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm collecting data of micro expressions.

91
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,980
Can you help me with my work?

92
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,750
Sure.

93
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,620
Okay.

94
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,390
As the photos you've taken in a day

95
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,470
need to be uploaded to the system database

96
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,380
right on that day,

97
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,310
you might find that

98
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,100
you've taken thousands of photos in a day,

99
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,210
and after they are sent back to the system database,

100
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,240
you might find that they're all there.

101
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,130
So this job

102
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,800
not only tests your physical strength,

103
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,890
but it also requires you

104
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,090
to have good judgement on expressions.

105
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,320
I'll try my best.

106
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,510
In 15 minutes,

107
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,820

108
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,679
Come back to the company now.

109
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,590
It's so urgent?

110
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,990
What's wrong?

111
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,309
Something serious.

112
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,810
Sorry, I'm late.

113
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,020
It's not that we don't want to do it.

114
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,170
But now the problem is that

115
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,870
the basic algorithm is getting more and more templatized.

116
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,190
Besides, the techniques of using this method

117
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,830
are kind of simple.

118
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,870
This has nothing to do

119
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,600
with our specific operations.

120
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,880
The investors are not very satisfied with

121
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,930
Xiaojiu's sensitivity.

122
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,340
The level of the quality test must be improved.

123
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:04,750
No.

124
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,350
Our foundation is just like that.

125
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,750
Unless we build our own modules,

126
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,810
what else can we do?

127
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,850
Mr. Gu,

128
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,660
do you mean...

129
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,560
We have to redesign the engine?

130
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,680
Well, we have to redesign it?

131
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,590
Did I hear it right?

132
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,650
That's what I mean.

133
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,380
Why can't we

134
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,520
change the operating system?

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,040
Do we have to design the engine ourselves?

136
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,510
Mr. Gu,

137
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,350
have you ever considered

138
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,310
the problem of time?

139
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,150
Right.

140
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,690
The current engine system

141
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,690
has been modified and improved

142
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,450
for decades.

143
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,810
Now you want us to redesign it

144
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,870
within two months.

145
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,390
Mr. Gu.

146
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,050
even Zuckerberg

147
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,170
might want to surrender.

148
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,170
Right, Master Ka?

149
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,700
I've asked someone else

150
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,470
to design the main part of the engine.

151
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,670
You are in charge of the auxiliary work.

152
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,370
Besides,

153
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,830
this is my decision.

154
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm not discussing it with you.

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,520
Dismiss.

156
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:48,930
Mr. Fei,

157
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,780
why didn't you say something?

158
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,070
Who can explain to me

159
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,950
what Mr. Gu meant just now?

160
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,250
In short,

161
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,320
Mr. Gu wants us

162
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,960
to create an engine by ourselves.

163
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,620
Creating an engine by ourselves?

164
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,000
C! C!

165
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,480
What on earth does it mean?

166
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,460
It means designing

167
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,350
the core components of interactive actions that will be handled

168
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,260
by interactive robots in a real-time manner

169
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,250
so as to quickly invoke

170
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,100
the whole robotic

171
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,760
sensing interactive system.

172
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,020
How stupid.

173
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,790
I'm... I'm sorry.

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,480
When a programmer writes a program,

175
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
it's like a writer

176
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,590
writing articles with words.

177
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,550
Creating an engine

178
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,210
is like a writer

179
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,250
developing a written language system

180
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,050
by himself.

181
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,880
What are they talking about?

182
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,310
But it sounds

183
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,630
quite amazing.

184
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,120
I'm leaving.

185
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,400
-Okay. Bye. -Bye.

186
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,780
Bye.

187
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,170
Bye.

188
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,130
Ms. Hu.

189
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,420
You're still here?

190
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,730
I was waiting for a fax.

191
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,800
Do you need me to drive you to the subway station?

192
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,870
No.

193
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,030
I still need to stay here for some time.

194
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,700
Are you not feeling well?

195
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,280
No.

196
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,980
But there has been something wrong with my stomach and intestines recently.

197
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,040
I'm leaving first.

198
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,870
Okay, Ms. Hu. Don't worry.

199
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,670
Be careful on your way back home.

200
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,510
Mr. Gu, you're still at work?

201
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,730
By the way, Mr. Gu,

202
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,480
for our holiday gifts this time,

203
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
should we choose some

204
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
moisturizing products?

205
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,210
The wind from the air conditioner in this building

206
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,770
is too strong and too dry.

207
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,570
It's not quite good for women.

208
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,870
I've worked here for a few days,

209
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,600
and I've got several wrinkles.

210
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,760
Even Hao Liang suffers from stomach

211
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,550
and intestines problems because of it.

212
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,260
She often squats in the toilet

213
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,630
and is unable to poop.

214
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,250
Okay.

215
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,560
After I choose the holiday gifts,

216
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,760
I'll show them to you.

217
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,120
What do you mean by leaving without telling you?

218
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,150
I told you to come back to

219
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,540
China with me and then get married

220
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,870
to me in China, didn't I?

221
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,800
You didn't come back with me,

222
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,640
and now you're saying that

223
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,770
I'm irresponsible?

224
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,650
You said this every time.

225
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,450
Every day, I told you

226
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,360
to come back.

227
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,870
Don't just water one flower.

228
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,530
Water the other flowers, too.

229
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,060
I'm hanging up.

230
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,470
Got it.

231
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,140
Right. Water the flowers.

232
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,800
According to my analysis,

233
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,870
I don't think it's appropriate to use

234
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,350
the outflanking tactics on this boy.

235
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,910
She should just

236
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,260
push him down directly.

237
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,680
What's the matter?

238
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,190
At 8 o'clock tonight,

239
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,160
I want to see you in Qixiu's

240
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
live stream room.

241
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,510
Otherwise,

242
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,060
you'll have to bear the consequences.

243
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,780
We agreed to meet at 7 o'clock.

244
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,980
Why are you this late?

245
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,930
How dare you criticize me?

246
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,550
A few days ago, who promised

247
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,080
to pick me up at the airport?

248
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,170
In the end, you stood me up.

249
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,920
I suddenly had something to do.

250
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,180
8818.

251
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,360
It's only been a few days since you moved into this building.

252
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,100
Don't tell me that

253
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,450
you've hooked up with a female streamer of the studio

254
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,470
across from your company.

255
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,000
How long have you been here?

256
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,140
And you already know what business

257
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
the studio across from my company does?

258
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,870
So it's true?

259
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,850
Hurry up. Do you have a photo?

260
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,670
What does she look like?

261
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,610
How is it going now?

262
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,070
Tell me.

263
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,700
You're thinking too much, aren't you?

264
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,640
You want to hide it from me?

265
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,070
When I hid my romantic relationship

266
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,000
from my parents,

267
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,670
you were still trying to

268
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,070
solve three-variable linear equations.

269
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,530
Alright. You're awesome.

270
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,870
Just tell me about it

271
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,890
so that I can teach you how to date.

272
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Let's get to work.

273
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:08,790
Okay.

274
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,770
To thank you

275
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,590
for your company in the first 30 weeks,

276
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,750
as long as the number of fans

277
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,860
exceeds 100,000 in today's live streaming,

278
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,990
there will be a rewards event for fans.

279
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,800
Dai is on the cover.

280
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,620
It's the Fans' Carnival Day.

281
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,420
Dai is amazing.

282
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,150
I'm looking forward to it.

283
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,480
Ms. Dai is such a beauty.

284
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,150
How is the replacing process

285
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,590
of the new and old code environments?

286
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,430
It's 2% now.

287
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,940
That's not bad.

288
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,940
However,

289
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,310
1,020 bugs

290
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,550
have been generated.

291
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,400
Are you sure you want to do this?

292
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,450
Of course.

293
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,430
Okay.

294
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,950
But let's make it clear first.

295
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,390
I'm not in charge of debugging.

296
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,820
Why do you

297
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,600
still have

298
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,560
the thoughts of an old programmer?

299
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,050
Next, I'll give you

300
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,410
Ms. Dai's

301
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,700
classic nine continuous shots.

302
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,830
Prepare to take screenshots.

303
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,730
Get some sunflower seeds, coke and chips.

304
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,390
Let's begin to watch the show.

305
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
We want some specific expressions.

306
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,310
Okay.

307
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,260
What expression do you want to see?

308
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,820
We want to see Dai's expressions when she's in love.

309
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,910
It's kind of difficult.

310
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,520
But I can challenge it.

311
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,690
Jiuli.

312
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,060
His birthday is April 25.

313
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,410
Is that him?

314
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,280
I didn't know you had a beautiful face and a nice voice.

315
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,900
After I saw you today, I've found that you're charming indeed.

316
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,300
I'll only listen to you singing from now on.

317
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,030
Your account name is very special.

318
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,450
Is there a story about it?

319
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,730
It's a combination of the Pinyin of his name and his birthday.

320
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,340
It's a combination of Jiuli

321
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,530
and his birthday.

322
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,710
Isn't the hint quite obvious?

323
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,110
He always talks about the cross-race effect.

324
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,240
It's just an excuse.

325
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
It turns out that you like this type?

326
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,350
I'll just help you.

327
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,860
What are you doing?

328
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,840
I found a few bugs here.

329
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,560
However,

330
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,630
I can

331
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,560
fix the problem for you.

332
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,020
I'm not sure whether I can do it in the future.

333
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,320
Have you finished?

334
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:36,870
Yes.

335
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,630
If you've finished, let's go.

336
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,160
Let's go.

337
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,480
Xiaojiu, turn on the light.

338
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,410
Yes, Master.

339
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,210
Is anyone there?

340
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,870
Here comes the big wolf.

341
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,900
I saw your feet.

342
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,150
Okay.

343
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,350
I've finished checking it.

344
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,360
It looks like

345
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,770
our old virgin

346
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,320
is still single.

347
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,830
You've finished checking it?

348
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,360
Go back if you've finished.

349
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,670
Since you really don't have a woman at your home,

350
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,900
let me sleep in the guest room.

351
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,750
Your non-government organization

352
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,420
is so poor that

353
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,400
it can't even pay the travel expenses

354
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,460
for the employees?

355
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,350
Bro,

356
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,730
you asked me to come back

357
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,020
to handle a big project with you.

358
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,180
It's not too much to ask you to be in charge of

359
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,580
my accommodation, is it?

360
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,790
If you don't let me live here,

361
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,790
I won't

362
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,000
do this job.

363
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,780
Alright. You can live here.

364
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,750
But...

365
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:54,700
Stop.

366
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,310
If it's something that will hurt my feelings, don't say it.

367
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,110
Let me ask you.

368
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,970
Is there really no woman here?

369
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,860
You didn't clean up the house in advance, did you?

370
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,710
Don't look at me like this

371
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,140
as if I were an idiot.

372
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,540
I'm worried about you, Bro.

373
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,710
You don't have to worry about me.

374
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,850
Is it true that

375
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,450
you've never been in a romantic relationship?

376
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,070
As a 30-year-old

377
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,670
domineering CEO,

378
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,810
you don't even have a girlfriend.

379
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,910
Let me point out a logical error of yours.

380
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,910
I don't date,

381
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,030
but it doesn't mean that I don't know how to do it.

382
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,890
Let me point out

383
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,570
a logical error of yours, too.

384
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,070
Since you've never dated before,

385
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,870
how do you know that you can do it?

386
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,870
Why don't you give it a try?

387
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,230
There are some things

388
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,550
which you won't know until you give it a try.

389
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,750
There are some things

390
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,110
which might make you feel weak if you try too much.

391
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,570
It might make me feel weak?

392
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,560
What do you mean?

393
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,270
What you mean

394
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,100
is what I mean.

395
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,530
Old virgin.

396
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,710
How dare you laugh at me?

397
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,230
Hello, can we talk now?

398
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,710
Yes, go ahead.

399
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,170
Your grade

400
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,790
for the elective course of Higher Mathematics is out.

401
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,040
You only got 69 points.

402
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,940
What? 69 points?

403
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:19,710
Then...

404
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,350
what should I do?

405
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,940
Prepare for the make-up exam at once.

406
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,810
Thunderbolt Woman said that

407
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,620
there would be a make-up exam in a month.

408
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,230
If you fail again, you'll have to postpone your graduation.

409
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,110
My goodness.

410
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,390
Then...

411
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,860
Oh my god.

412
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,390
Higher Mathematics.

413
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,250
You only got 69 points, Hao Liang.

414
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,240
What are you talking about?

415
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,310
I heard everything.

416
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,070
Hao Liang.

417
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,910
What should I say about you?

418
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,810
You are really

419
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,440
a stupid girl.

420
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,460
Why are you scolding me?

421
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,400
I'm just stating the facts.

422
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,350
In terms of Higher Mathematics,

423
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,670
it's hard to get full marks.

424
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,030
But getting such a low score is even harder

425
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,430
than getting a full mark.

426
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,880
I'm going to tell everyone about it.

427
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,110
All the people around Mr. Gu

428
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,900
are straight-A students with high IQ.

429
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,300
You are quite different.

430
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,030
Don't tell anyone about it.

431
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,310
It's something so funny.

432
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,090
I must tell others about it

433
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,690
so as to make everyone happy.

434
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:09,930
I...

435
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,040
I'll give you the limited-edition merchandise.

436
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,190
Really?

437
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,960
Deal.

438
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,040
If I give it to you,

439
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,020
can you help me study Higher Mathematics?

440
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:31,910
Please.

441
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,960
I'll just consider this

442
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
as helping a student who has fallen behind.

443
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,550
Are you feeling unwell?

444
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,400
I'm... I'm fine.

445
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,260
Tell me.

446
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,750
Have you found any abnormal movements?

447
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,950
Abnormal movements?

448
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,270
Is the progress stuck

449
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,190
or has the memory overflowed?

450
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,830
Let me tell you.

451
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,450
We should change

452
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,090
the supplier.

453
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,790
I'm talking about those two people.

454
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,650
They had lunch together

455
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,450
for the third day continuously.

456
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,300
Those two people?

457
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,740
Yes.

458
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,830
Normally, it's hard to sense it.

459
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,010
He always calls her an idiot,

460
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,870
and he's reluctant to talk to her.

461
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,340
C is doing it so secretly.

462
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,670
We always say that we shouldn't date our colleagues.

463
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,220
Exactly.

464
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,300
But why did he take action in advance?

465
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,590
We were just too slow.

466
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,820
No.

467
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,820
Didn't I talk about

468
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,110
this question with you before?

469
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,790
How come you still can't remember it?

470
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,990
Why are you so stupid?

471
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,270
Let me tell you.

472
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,890
I'll explain it to you one last time.

473
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,750
If you still can't remember it...

474
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,090
Today, you still failed to write the right answers

475
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,240
about the exercises you had done yesterday.

476
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,170
I'm speechless.

477
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,260
I'm sorry.

478
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,930
If you fail to write the right answers again tomorrow, I'll go on strike.

479
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,860
We've arrived at the company. Stop talking about it.

480
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
You're so stupid.

481
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,820
Tell me.

482
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,300
Where did you go?

483
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,920
-We went to buy milk tea.
-We went to have lunch.

484
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,770
-We had lunch first and then bought...
-We bought milk tea first and then had...

485
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,810
Idiot.

486
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,410
Where did you drink milk tea?

487
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,080
It's none of your business.

488
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,010
You're all here.

489
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,500
I'm going to give out the holiday gifts.

490
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,850
Here you are, C.

491
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,870
Thank you.

492
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,070
Hao Liang.

493
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,950
Thank you.

494
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,090
Thank you, Ms. Hu.

495
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,000
Thank you, Ms. Hu.

496
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,600
Master Ka.

497
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,050
What is this?

498
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,440
An intelligent thermal cup.

499
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,160
Last year, the holiday gift was an electronic bracelet.

500
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,510
The style changed so greatly this year?

501
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,440
Look at you guys.

502
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,670
There are gifts for you, but you're still so picky.

503
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,870
Hao Liang.

504
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,390
Hao Liang.

505
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,930
You should thank Mr. Gu

506
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,730
for the holiday gifts this time.

507
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,790
This thermal cup

508
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,020
was specially chosen by Mr. Gu

509
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,080
for the sake of you.

510
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,170
I... I don't have any requirements for the holiday gift.

511
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,790
Do you remember that

512
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,770
once after work,

513
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,120
you squatted in the toilet for a long time?

514
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,030
Is Ms. Hu talking about

515
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,990
the incident that I got changed in the washroom?

516
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,060
I told Mr. Gu

517
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,320
about your situaion.

518
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,770
I said that the wind from the air conditioner

519
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,720
in this building

520
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,860
was too strong and too dry.

521
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,330
You suffered from constipation because of it.

522
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,610
Mr. Gu took my advice.

523
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,980
Although he didn't want to recruit you previously,

524
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,590
he still hired you in the end.

525
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,610
He's very considerate towards you.

526
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,520
He thought I suffered from constipation.

527
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,890
Ms. Hu, no, no, no. It was not like that.

528
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,010
I didn't.

529
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,750
Just work hard.

530
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't disappoint your leader

531
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
as he cares about you so much.

532
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,590
Ms. Hu. Ms. Hu. Ms. Hu.

533
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,980
Do you have extra holiday gifts?

534
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,020
What do you want to do?

535
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,260
I've just sent a photo

536
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,270
to my girlfriend.

537
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,350
She likes this cup

538
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,580
and wants to get the same cup to show that we're a couple.

539
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,380
But these cups are custom-made.

540
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,890
Mr. Gu has an extra cup.

541
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,490
Go ask him.

542
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,620
I've just asked him.

543
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,670
He wants to give it to someone else.

544
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,420
Besides, my girlfriend

545
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,350
wants a pink one.

546
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,470
Mr. Fei, Liang's cup is pink.

547
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,580
What are you doing?

548
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:06,970
Liang.

549
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
Mr. Fei. Mr. Fei. Mr. Fei.

550
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,900
How can you

551
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,350
be so inconsiderate?

552
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,780
You want another similar cup to show that you and your girlfriend are a couple,

553
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,110
but you can't separate them.

554
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,520
Look.

555
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,710
Hao Liang has the cartoon figure of Tom on her cup,

556
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,510
while C has the cartoon figure of Jerry on his cup.

557
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,310
Tom and Jerry.

558
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,080
You understand this, right?

559
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,160
What do you mean by being a couple?

560
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,680
I know. I know everything.

561
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,750
Do you think this stupid girl and I are...

562
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,840
Listen to you calling her "Stupid Girl".

563
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,730
How sweet it sounds.

564
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,850
There's even a nickname to show affection.

565
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,070
The relationship between you two is progressing too fast.

566
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,950
We are just simply...

567
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,040
They're holding hands directly, Mr. Fei.

568
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,450
It's okay. They're a young couple.

569
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:40,980
Shi Fei.

570
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,710
Don't tell Mr. Gu about it.

571
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,000
We're bachelors, and they've made us so jealous.

572
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,600
Mr. Gu, you want to talk to me?

573
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,920
There are too many errors in the data.

574
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,580
Rewrite it.

575
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,410
What are you doing?

576
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,360
You promised me

577
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,450
to keep it a secret.

578
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,230
Now they're

579
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,900
suspecting that we're a couple.

580
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
I have to explain it to them clearly.

581
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,110
No, no, no.

582
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,670
Please. Please.

583
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,460
Then you should give your thermal cup to Fei.

584
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,070
Why?

585
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,440
To prove that we don't want to be a couple.

586
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,060
C has made

587
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,760
many stupid mistakes lately.

588
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,290
It seems that dating

589
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,220
can really affect a person's work.

590
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,400
These thermal cups

591
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,660
are gifts from Mr. Gu for drinking water.

592
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,230
Do you have to use this cup to drink water?

593
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,330
That's different.

594
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:37,930
I'll...

595
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,110
I'll additionally give you

596
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,310
an autographed photo from the idol's handshake meeting.

597
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,240
Let go of me.

598
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,210
Really?

599
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,740
Even if Mr. Gu points a gun at me,

600
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,400
I won't disclose your secret.

601
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,220
Really?

602
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,910
Yes.

603
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,110
Mr. Gu, let me tell you some gossip news.

604
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,590
It seems that C and Hao Liang

605
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,890
are dating.

606
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,570
Nowadays, do young people in a romantic relationship

607
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,500
show their affection so strongly?

608
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,800
It looks like we're old.

609
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,690
We're not old at all.

610
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,490
Hao Liang was born in 2000.

611
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,110
She's ten years younger than you.

612
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,170
Although C studied for double master's degrees,

613
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,430
he's only two years older than Hao Liang.

614
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,400
There is a gap of a generation between them and us.

615
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,770
Is their relationship considered as puppy love?

616
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,760
I don't think so.

617
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,920
They're adults now.

618
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,030
Mr. Gu,

619
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,030
do you

620
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,790
disapprove of office romance?

621
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,430
Mr. Gu, just tell me.

622
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,660
Do you approve or not?

623
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,050
I never interfere

624
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,350
in employees' private life.

625
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:45,940
Okay.

626
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,590
♫The temperature is rising rapidly♫

627
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,710
♫My heart is pounding♫

628
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,030
What is this?

629
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,410
Employee benefits.

630
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,170
There is such kind of good thing?

631
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,950
Are you sure?

632
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,420
What does zzsg mean?

633
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,230
True feelings.

634
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,070
What about yysy?

635
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,430
Speak according to facts.

636
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,360
Wait a moment.

637
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,270
Let me watch it.

638
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,630
What about bbl?

639
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,310
Ball ball you,

640
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,970
which means "I beg you".

641
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,650
That's not right.

642
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,920
The first few words are Pinyin abbreviations,

643
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,230
so this one should be

644
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,640
qqnl.

645
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,490
B

646
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,480
means Ball.

647
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,070
It's the ball which people kick.

648
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,080
Didn't I tell you just now?

649
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,090
Ball ball you.

650
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,180
So other than Pinyin abbreviations,

651
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,690
there are also English homophones

652
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,170
and Chinese acronyms?

653
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,540
Well,

654
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,950
in different situations,

655
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,020
what kind of mechanism will trigger it?

656
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,580
And what's the pattern?

657
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,000
Ball ball you (I beg you).

658
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,310
Please don't give me a hard time.

659
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,660
This is the language of young people like me.

660
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,120
It's hard to explain it with just a few words.

661
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,020
I'm also one of the post-90s generation.

662
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:23,700
Okay.

663
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,490
Let me tell you

664
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,840
about the theory of age.

665
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,070
Although the media likes

666
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,570
to use such words as post-80s, post-90s

667
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,650
and even post-95, to divide people into different groups.

668
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,050
But for

669
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,160
real young people,

670
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,890
all those who are older than us

671
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,890
are called old people.

672
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,530
I've just turned 30.

673
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,390
In our eyes,

674
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,040
30 years old is an age

675
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,910
when one can go to die.

676
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,260
Don't forget that

677
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,360
you're only two years younger than me.

678
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
Yes, I am two years younger than you.

679
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,730
But my psychological age

680
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,530
is ten years younger than yours.

681
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,600
No.

682
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,710
Your psychological age

683
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,800
is even ten years older

684
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,810
than your peers'.

685
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,490
So there is the age difference

686
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,850
of 20 years between us.

687
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,060
If you had worked harder,

688
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,090
you would have got a son like me,

689
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,720
Uncle Gu.

690
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,420
Shut up.

691
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,440
Let's go to the bar later.

692
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,590
Li called me.

693
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:12,680
Okay.

694
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,210
Let's have a drink.

695
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,760
Qql, bbl.

696
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,240
What?

697
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,260
Thank you

698
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,690
for your company today.

699
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,970
See you next week.

700
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,610
Bye.

701
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,260
I left the small gift for you at the reception desk.

702
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,520
I hope you will like it.

703
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,750
It seems that

704
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,440
telling him my feelings directly is effective.

705
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,360
Aunt Yibai.

706
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,560
It turns out that he gave everyone a thermal cup

707
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,970
because of Dai.

708
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
It's okay.

709
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,030
I'm Dai.

710
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,470
I'm also Hao Liang.

711
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,430
I'm both of them.

712
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,510
If you have time to think about the man you like,

713
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,630
you might as well

714
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,390
study for your Higher Mathematics make-up exam.

715
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,880
Why did you spoil the fun?

716
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,270
I spoiled the fun?

717
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,690
Miss,

718
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,690
what will happen

719
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,640
if your mother knows it?

720
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,020
She'll come over to scold you.

721
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,690
Your live stream show,

722
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,150
your identity of Ms. Dai and your program of Qixiu Grand Ceremony

723
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,890
will all be over if she discovers them.

724
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,420
You think I spoiled the fun?

725
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,190
There's also the make-up exam.

726
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,230
You got such a low score previously.

727
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,050
Do you think you can pass the make-up exam at a time?

728
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,750
The cup has the function of constant temperature.

729
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,860
I specially bought it for you.

730
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,520
Remember to drink more water.

731
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,060
He's so considerate.

732
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,160
He sent another message.

733
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,820
Do you want me to read it to you?

734
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,430
At 12:30 tomorrow,

735
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,580
would you like to

736
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,030
have lunch with me at Duoxia Restaurant?

737
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,230
Aunt... Aunt Yibai.

738
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,850
Is he going to have a date with me?

739
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,250
I can't stand it.

740
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,250
Here you are. As usual.

741
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,630
Li,

742
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,590
your bar

743
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,790
should be redecorated.

744
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,630
Look at the plank.

745
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,590
It's so broken.

746
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,010
If I redecorate it,

747
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,830
will you still want to come here?

748
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:26,810
Right.

749
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,719
You guys drink first.

750
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,920
I'll come back later.

751
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,440
Is it your company's holiday tomorrow?

752
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,800
What's the matter?

753
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Make some time for me.

754
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,350
I'll take you to an important place.

755
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,020
You'll know when you get there.

756
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,030
You'd better tell me now,

757
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,150
and I'll decide whether to go or not.

758
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,280
If you don't tell me,

759
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,280
I won't go.

760
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,110
I surrender.

761
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,429
I've asked someone out for you, whom you want to date

762
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,690
but don't dare to date.

763
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,860
Do you have to be so excited?

764
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,020
Now you're not afraid he'll find out that

765
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,220
you are Hao Liang?

766
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,840
You're not afraid that he'll fall out with you?

767
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,460
Don't be so pessimistic.

768
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,470
What's wrong?

769
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,200
This is bad luck.

770
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
Ms. Chen has decided to tutor

771
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,190
the students who failed the Higher Mathematics exam.

772
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,400
Those who attend the class today

773
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,660
will get extra 10 points for the make-up exam.

774
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,480
Those who don't attend the class will fail the exam directly.

775
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,220
Thunderbolt Woman is so kind that

776
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,550
she wants to tutor us for the make-up exam.

777
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,920
If I don't go,

778
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,980
I guess I won't be able to graduate.

779
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,820
Indeed.

780
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,000
But he's still waiting for me.

781
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,680
So?

782
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,510
Aunt Yibai.

783
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,880
Aunt Yibai.

784
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,440
I'll go.

785
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,060
I'll go, okay?

786
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,420
Just focus on your studies for the make-up exam.

787
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,810
I'll go meet him for you.

788
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,590
I'll also take this chance

789
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,620
to explain everything to him clearly.

790
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,060
Great.

791
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,680
There's really a win-win solution in the world.

792
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,670
Luckily, I have a good aunt.

793
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,170
By the way, Aunt Yibai,

794
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,540
don't scare him.

795
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,650
I won't go if you keep nagging.

796
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,550
But I have to go back to the company first.

797
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,600
I left my Higher Mathematics textbook there.

798
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,260
I have to go.

799
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,280
Aunt Yibai, I love you.

800
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,090
Take it.

801
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,600
Thanks.

802
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,830
Isn't he supposed to be in the Duoxia Restaurant?

803
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,250
Who are you?

804
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,520
How did you come inside?

805
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,860
I've asked someone out for you, whom you want to date

806
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,950
but don't dare to date.

807
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,480
Who is it?

808
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,860
Firstly, I won't go.

809
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,430
Secondly, deal with

810
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,920
your own mess by yourself.

811
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,580
Thirdly, don't do it again.

812
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,490
As your good friend, I've

813
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,830
helped you to this degree.

814
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,100
If you still pretend that you don't care,

815
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,500
it'll be inappropriate.

816
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,590
I pretend that I don't care?

817
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,680
Well,

818
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,570
if you have no feelings for her,

819
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,460
why did you put that paper slip

820
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,120
with her room number in your pocket?

821
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Littering

822
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,500
isn't a good habit.

823
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,280
Indeed.

824
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,240
That's a big misunderstanding.

825
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,040
But I meant well.

826
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,360
You understand, right?

827
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,490
I understand, but I can't forgive you.

828
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,510
So what do you want?

829
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,570
You can go.

830
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,190
Qixiu's studio is across from our company.

831
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,110
I'm afraid if we stand her up this time,

832
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,260
she might come to our company

833
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,060
and pester us.

834
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,090
Fine.

835
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:21,930
Besides,

836
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,560
I have a piece of sincere advice for you.

837
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,490
When you go tomorrow,

838
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,440
keep a low profile with your dressing style.

839
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,410
You've never seen her before.

840
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,000
Why do you think she's a material girl?

841
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,110
How come you're just like my father?

842
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,310
I believe in statistical probability.

843
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,800
I'm sincere to my friend,

844
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,750
but my friend doesn't care about my sincerity at all.

845
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,720
8818.

846
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,740
You've seen Han?

847
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,480
Who?

848
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,220
I apologize to you

849
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,510
for his behavior.

850
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,180
All of this

851
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,780
is just his prank.

852
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,530
You mean that

853
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,430
at the backstage of the live stream room...

854
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:02,830
Yes.

855
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,990
He was the one who sent you all those messages.

856
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,520
He registered the account under my name

857
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,620
and contacted you privately.

858
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,350
He also gave you a gift in my name

859
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,460
and pretended to be me to ask you out.

860
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,010
If you hadn't given me the paper slip

861
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,420
with your room number that day...

862
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,830
If it had not been a coincidence that

863
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,940
I couldn't find a trash can,

864
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,950
which made me have no choice but to take it back to the office to discard it...

865
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,490
If it had not been a coincidence that

866
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,480
my friend saw it,

867
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,610
then all these misunderstandings

868
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,010
wouldn't have happened.

869
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,190
Let's not talk about him.

870
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,380
What about you?

871
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,720
Me?

872
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,750
Don't you

873
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,620
have any feelings for me?
