[Episode 18]

4
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,850
Let's go.

5
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,040
Be reserved. What are you doing?

6
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,230
You'll regret what you did just now.

7
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,620
Come on.

8
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,400
No need to rush.

9
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,650
You'll know soon.

10
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,170
Hudu University is the best.

11
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,660
All right.

12
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,860
I'll send it to the group chat after photoshopping it.

13
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,920
I'll send it later.

14
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,070
Three, two, one.

15
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,010
Panpan, the sponsor is here.

16
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,600
I...

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,120
I just posted a location on my Moments

18
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,860
and he came here from Suzhou.

19
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,980
Suzhou?

20
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,850
Is he on a business trip?

21
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,740
Yes, he's very busy.

22
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,550
He has no time

23
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,740
to reply to my WeChat messages.

24
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,640
He did it on purpose.

25
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,300
He prepared a surprise for me.

26
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,560
But as soon as he came,

27
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,890
he went to see Hao Liang.

28
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,700
Yes.

29
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,860
He also let Hao Liang take his clothes.

30
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,200
It's okay. Hao Liang was his subordinate.

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,230
They knew each other before. It's normal.

32
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,490
Am I pretty? Look at me.

33
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,220
Do I look good?

34
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,110
Very beautiful.

35
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,920
Let's go.

36
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:20,840
Come on.

37
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,600
Give it to me.

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,829
I'll take it. Thank you.

39
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,150
I'll take it.

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,690
Why did she take it over?

41
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,590
It's returned to me.

42
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,010
Let's watch the game.

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,870
Each controls four times.

44
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,470
The one who scores more wins.

45
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,690
Start the first shot.

46
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,500
Stand up.

47
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,570
Come on.

48
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,430
Mr. Gu, come on!

49
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,160
Come on!

50
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,390
Come on! Come on!

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,960
Isn't he handsome?

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,120
Come on.

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,670
Mr. Gu, come on!

54
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,570
Mr. Gu, come on!

55
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,750
Mr. Gu, come on!

56
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,030
Isn't he handsome?

57
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,780
Okay.

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,610
Second shot.

59
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,620
Go! Go! Go!

60
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,010
So cool!

61
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,110
Amazing.

62
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,060
Yeah.

63
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,020
With me here,

64
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,940
of course, he'll perform well.

65
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,800
As expected from your boyfriend.

66
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,470
Jealousy!

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,510
The third shot.

68
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,030
Serve!

69
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,770
Serve!

70
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,240
Fourth!

71
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,020
Go! Go! Go!

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,430
Go! Go! Go!

73
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,850
Mr. Gu is amazing, right?

74
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,010
It must be because you're here.

75
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,430
Yes.

76
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,300
The power of love.

77
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,990
With me here, of course.

78
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,470
To the right.

79
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,900
Come on.

80
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,220
So handsome!

81
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,340
Bring him water.

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,340
Excuse me.

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,790
Your girlfriend is here.

84
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,159
So handsome!

85
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,880
Your girlfriend is here.

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,740
Jiuli. You must be thirsty.

87
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,140
I prepared water for you.

88
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,990
Why do you have my clothes?

89
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,300
I saw Hao Liang holding it.

90
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,500
I wouldn't want to bother her.

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,260
So I took it.

92
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,980
It's natural for my girlfriend

93
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,040
to take my clothes.

94
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,690
Girlfriend? Are you kidding?

95
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,560
Hao Liang?

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,450
Didn't she tell you?

97
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,140
She's telling the truth?

98
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,110
I sponsored the drama club because of her.

99
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,300
I replaced her high heels because of her.

100
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,100
I did everything because of her.

101
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,930
Impossible.

102
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,360
What about recruiting me to the company?

103
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,890
It was a misunderstanding.

104
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
Your clothes.

105
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,140
Throw it away.

106
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,520
How could this happen?

107
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,160
Alright, stop looking.

108
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,090
Panpan, we're leaving.

109
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,760
Don't be like this.

110
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,620
Go away.

111
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,980
It's just a game.

112
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,540
Are you serious?

113
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,430
Look at you.

114
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,920
You're acting like it's the end of the world.

115
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Let me ask you.

116
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,040
Who is more important

117
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,050
to you, me or him?

118
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,380
Well...

119
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,230
You hesitated.

120
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,690
You actually hesitated

121
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,650
between a man

122
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,860
you've only known for only a few months

123
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,010
and me.

124
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,760
I'll give you another chance.

125
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,700
Who is more important, me or him?

126
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,660
You two are different.

127
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,390
Of course.

128
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,220
Your mom and my mom are good friends.

129
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,340
We grew up together.

130
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,450
Since I came here

131
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,610
and went to college,

132
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,740
besides my aunt,

133
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,960
you've been the closest person to me.

134
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,420
That's good.

135
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,610
I've only known Mr. Gu

136
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,270
for less than half a year,

137
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,020
so naturally, our time together

138
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,420
doesn't compare to the time I've known you.

139
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,060
But he...

140
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,860
He is the first person

141
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,520
I've ever fallen in love with.

142
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,020
Are you crazy?

143
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,460
You'd go for a guy

144
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,640
who makes confessions like that?

145
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
No, I...

146
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,280
Are you going to tell me

147
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,920
you still like him?

148
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,700
We are together now.

149
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,550
When did this happen?

150
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,910
Last week.

151
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,510
Last week?

152
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,240
And you're only telling me now?

153
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,900
Can you keep it a secret for me?

154
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,420
I don't want to talk to you.

155
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,130
Leave.

156
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:21,980
Well.

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,810
Let's go.

158
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,550
You're leaving just like that?

159
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,909
Didn't you ask me to leave?

160
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,510
Do you leave when I ask you to leave?

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
What are you laughing at?

162
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,060
Can't I laugh?

163
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,720
He's in a bad mood.

164
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,520
Stop talking.

165
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,530
True, he lost the game.

166
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,140
It's natural to feel down.

167
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,580
What are you boasting about?

168
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,840
I'm just stating the facts.

169
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,980
Also,

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
since Dan already mentioned it,

171
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,170
I'll make it clear too.

172
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,580
You and my girlfriend

173
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,100
are just friends.

174
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,300
You can hang out as usual,

175
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,740
but no physical contact.

176
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,640
Let's go.

177
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,590
Dan.

178
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,850
Don't forget this Friday night.

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,770
Friday night?

180
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,800
You know, that...

181
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,520
I know.

182
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,680
I won't forget.

183
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
Do you have plans?

184
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,420
Yes.

185
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:50,900
What plans?

186
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,270
None of your business.

187
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,870
Nothing.

188
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,100
Nothing important.

189
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,110
The door is open.

190
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,120
You're back so early.

191
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,220
The door is closed.

192
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,830
I smell

193
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,380
a hint of dissatisfaction.

194
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,710
Something is wrong with Hao Liang.

195
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,040
What's the deal with you and him going out on Friday?

196
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,920
Is it not convenient to say?

197
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,990
No.

198
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,080
It's Zhu Yi's mother's birthday.

199
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,870
I'm going to accompany him to buy a gift first,

200
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,880
and then we'll have dinner with his mother.

201
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,290
Does she and Zhu Yi have an affair?

202
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,060
Then what's wrong with my niece?

203
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,030
She's hiding something from me.

204
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,740
What is it?

205
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,520
I don't know.

206
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,360
This is groundless.

207
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
It can't be wrong.

208
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,270
Where is the evidence?

209
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,250
I don't have any.

210
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,750
My sixth sense told me that.

211
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,410
They say people in love

212
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,140
lose their intelligence.

213
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,340
Didn't expect you'd

214
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,280
be the same.

215
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,970
Okay, cheer up.

216
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,620
Here.

217
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,230
Take a look.

218
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,660
What is this?

219
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,220
Ms. Hu gave it to me before she left.

220
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,640
The company's team-building video is ready.

221
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,300
Take a look.

222
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,010
I'm not in the mood.

223
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,620
Fine.

224
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,860

234

Why does this voice

235
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,790
sound so familiar?

236
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,050
Both Jiuli

237
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,620
and birthday.

238
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,210
I didn't know Gu liked this type.

239
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,050
Let me help you.

240
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,640

♫To draw concentric circles together♫

250
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,260
Dai, to reward your fans, please show your face.

251
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,870
It's getting dark.

252
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,260
It's going to rain.

253
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,510
Even Heaven is crying for me.

254
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,590
It's seven o'clock.

255
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,520
It's normal that the sun goes down.

256
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,050
Who is it?

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,530
Who?

258
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,450
Why are you here

259
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,670
eavesdropping on me?

260
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,120
I was sleeping here.

261
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,590
But then I heard you saying, "It's going to rain.

262
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,250
Even Heaven is crying for me."

263
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,370
Are you trying to take advantage

264
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,630
of my heartbreak?

265
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,700
Am I right?

266
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,510
Are you crazy?

267
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,210
You are the one who's crazy.

268
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,450
He's also a pitiful person.

269
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,020
Why can't I cry?

270
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,070
I feel so bad.

271
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,290
The environment must be wrong.

272
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,180
I need to change to a more sorrowful environment

273
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,040
to fully experience the sadness.

274
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,130
Let me change to another environment.

275
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,040
Let me do it.

276
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,710
This is the wine list.

277
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,440
-Take a look and see what you want to drink.
-Okay.

278
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,120
I'll have a...

279
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,320
I'll have a vodka.

280
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,980
I'll have a Mojito.

281
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,790
I don't want ice. I want it neat.

282
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,270
Can I not add alcohol?

283
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,550
This is a bar.

284
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
We serve alcohol.

285
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,100
Do you need green tea?

286
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,620
No, I want it neat,

287
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,660
the kind that can make people drunk.

288
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,870
OK, this one.

289
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,670
OK.

290
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,150
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

291
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,720
Ask him to go.

292
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,450
Ask her to go.

293
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,880
Ask her to go.

294
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,890
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,110
This is the only table left.

296
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,260
We'll go get the drinks first.

297
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,920
We'll go get the drinks first.

298
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,970
Zhu Yi.

299
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,760
Did you follow me here?

300
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,700
Stop assuming, Missy.

301
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,740
First come, first served. I came first.

302
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,780
Do you like me?

303
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,290
You didn't drink at the bar.

304
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,420
Why are you here

305
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,460
if not to track me?

306
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,260
I've had a heartbreak, I'm here to drown my sorrows.

307
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,140
Heartbreak?

308
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,470
You haven't even started dating,

309
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,430
where does the heartbreak come from?

310
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm the one who's heartbroken.

311
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,660
Don't flatter yourself.

312
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,170
When did Gu Jiuli like you?

313
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,540
When did he ever look at you?

314
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,820
When did Hao Liang like you?

315
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,860
When did he ever look at you?

316
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,440
You know nothing about love.

317
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,190
I know.

318
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,140
You don't know.

319
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:13,570
I know.

320
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,040
You don't know.

321
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,490
I know.

322
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,450
Why doesn't he like me?

323
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,580
Who are you talking about?

324
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,020
Gu Jiuli.

325
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,740
Why doesn't Gu Jiuli like me?

326
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,710
He likes Hao Liang.

327
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,620
Hao Liang?

328
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,800
Between me and Hao Liang,

329
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,210
he likes Hao Liang.

330
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm a princess.

331
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,990
Everyone dotes on me.

332
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,970
Do you know what a princess is?

333
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,420
The princess is adored by thousands.

334
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,180
Isn't that good?

335
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,380
Since I was young,

336
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,609
people call me a princess.

337
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,210
No matter where I go,

338
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,750
everyone says I'm cute and pretty

339
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,619
and am a princess.

340
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,620
The princess is the prettiest.

341
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,170
How am I worse than Hao Liang?

342
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,510
I...

343
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,790
I'm a princess.

344
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,590
He doesn't even like a princess.

345
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,580
Is he stupid?

346
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,370
What kind of ugly princess is that?

347
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,700
I'm ugly?

348
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,020
After I reapply my makeup,

349
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,610
I'll still be a princess.

350
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,300
Reapply it for me. Hurry.

351
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,210
Reapply it for me.

352
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,690
Yibai.

353
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,220
Yibai.

354
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,540
Yibai.

355
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,380
Let's have breakfast together.

356
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,680
What are you doing so early in the morning?

357
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,340
I want to talk to you about Dai,

358
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,670
or, Hao Liang.

359
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,540
You know everything?

360
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,600
What about Gu Jiuli?

361
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,750
I didn't tell him.

362
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,550
But I want to know

363
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:57,980
why.

364
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,920
Let Dan tell him herself.

365
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,420
Just because of this,

366
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,910
you kept being a live streamer

367
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,770
from everyone?

368
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,460
Jie,

369
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,010
please help me

370
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
keep this secret.

371
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,850
Dan.

372
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,360
It's not necessary.

373
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,660
But if you say so,

374
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,540
I'm definitely on your side.

375
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,500
Although Gu and I are good friends,

376
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,320
you and I are relatives.

377
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,940
I can tell

378
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,200
who is an outsider.

379
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,680
Jie, thank you so much.

380
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Don't call me Jie.

381
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,590
Don't be so distant.

382
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,580
Are you planning to keep hiding it from him?

383
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,070
Of course not.

384
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,660
When will you confess?

385
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,130
Don't force her.

386
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,860
Fine.

387
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,150
But you have to promise me

388
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
when you confess,

389
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,540
you must tell me.

390
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,960
Let me tell you.

391
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,220
Gu

392
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,180
has always been

393
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,660
more intelligent than me.

394
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,740
No one

395
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,090
set such a big trap for him.

396
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,380
I really want to know

397
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,170
what Gu's expression and reaction

398
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,150
will be after he knows about it.

399
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,680
It must be a huge explosion.

400
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,860
The door is open.

401
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,070
Xiaojiu, turn on the light.

402
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,170
The door is closed.

403
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,860
You're back.

404
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,240
Are you crazy?

405
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,610
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

406
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,410
What are you looking at outside?

407
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,580
Hao Liang

408
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,940
is going to

409
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,700
celebrate Zhu Yi's mother's birthday with him.

410
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,810
Hao Liang is going

411
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,560
to celebrate Zhu Yi's mother's birthday?

412
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,690
Isn't she going to be with Zhu Yi?

413
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,140
How about you go with her?

414
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,990
I suggested it.

415
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,240
She turned me down.

416
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,970
No wonder you are

417
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,790
so depressed.

418
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,740
You're about to be cheated on.

419
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,470
Of course, you can't smile.

420
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,040
But

421
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,410
if she doesn't let you go,

422
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,660
you can stop her.

423
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,730
Just tell her

424
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,450
you're sick

425
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,140
and no one takes care of you.

426
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,670
You're miserable and bitter.

427
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,710
She will definitely reject

428
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,780
Zhu Yi's mother's birthday party

429
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
to accompany you.

430
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,140
That's a lie.

431
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,040
This is not a lie.

432
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,350
This is called a temporary measure.

433
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,610
A lie out of love.

434
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,010
I'm different from you.

435
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,270
I never lie.

436
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:50,680
Fine.

437
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,500
Great.

438
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,420
"I never lie."

439
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,290
What are you doing?

440
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,910
I'm going to get myself sick.

441
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,010
Are you crazy?

442
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,370
After taking a shower, you're staying here with the air conditioning on

443
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,570
and without clothes.

444
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,220
You said if I were sick,

445
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,100
Hao Liang wouldn't go

446
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,900
and would come to take care of me.

447
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,030
This is good.

448
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,430
Are you sick?

449
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,120
Is it so obvious?

450
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,190
Did you really

451
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,590
have the air conditioner on all night here?

452
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,830
Oh my god.

453
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,410
It's not scientific.

454
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,410
Is it broken?

455
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,630
No.

456
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,930
36.7 degrees.

457
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,560
No.

458
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,100
I need to take another cold shower.

459
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,040
You...

460
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,550
Seven, eight.

461
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,400
Okay.

462
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,000
How about this?

463
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,180
Let's take a ten-minute break.

464
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,900
Okay.

465
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,980
You danced well.

466
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,480
Apart from the previous moves,

467
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,090
are there any new moves

468
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,680
to teach me?

469
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,140
Come on.

470
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,810
One, two, three, four.

471
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,490
[Your man is sick.]

472
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,810
Yes.

473
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,650
Yes, let's do it again.

474
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,960
One, two, three, four.

475
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,670
I've told Hao Liang

476
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,740
you're sick.

477
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,030
So,

478
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,220
she'll be here soon.

479
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,030
You lied.

480
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,410
Don't worry.

481
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,850
You didn't lie.

482
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,130
I'm the one who lied.

483
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,100
Just put the blame

484
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,980
on me.

485
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,470
Don’t do it again.

486
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,710
Hao Liang will be here soon.

487
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,750
Are you going to see her like this?

488
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,460
You're right.

489
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,260
I'll talk to you later, Yibai.

490
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,440
If you dress like this,

491
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,510
when Hao Liang comes,

492
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,380
she will leave immediately.

493
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,380
Do you believe me?

494
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,680
What should I wear?

495
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,050
I have a piece of clothes

496
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,630
that suits you very well.

497
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,530
Isn't it good?

498
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,300
You need to be less energetic.

499
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,520
Okay.

500
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,070
She's here.

501
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,580
Go.

502
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,680
I'll go over there.

503
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,620
I'll leave the space to you.

504
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,750
You go open the door.

505
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,470
Are you Mr. Gu Jiuli?

506
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,370
Yes.

507
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,650
This is a fever reducer

508
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,130
bought for you by Miss Hao.

509
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,010
Thank you.

510
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,640
Where is she?

511
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,090
Gu, listen to me.

512
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,130
You can't do this.

513
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,210
Gu!

514
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,560
Gu, listen to me.

515
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
You can't do this.

516
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,320
Dan.

517
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,550
Bad news.

518
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,370
I think

519
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,030
Gu is going to hit someone.

520
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,750
Hudu University.

521
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,020
What department do you want to visit?

522
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,190
Internal Medicine.

523
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,570
When people turn 30,

524
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,820
there will always be various problems.

525
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,200
But your body

526
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,360
is very healthy.

527
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,460
I know

528
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,440
your life is under great pressure.

529
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,160
But you're perfectly fine.

530
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,240
Congratulations.

531
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,650
Thank you.

532
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,540
You have good eyesight.

533
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,880
Very healthy.

534
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,460
[ECG Room]

535
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,670
Good teeth.

536
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,900
Should we inform the security department?

537
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,870
He is emotionally stable.

538
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:13,670
No need.

539
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,010
I just asked

540
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,960
all the departments he went to see.

541
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,720
He's fine.

542
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,490
I suspect he's up to something.

543
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,150
Excuse me.

544
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,070
Hello.

545
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,960
Which other department is there?

546
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,370
Zhu Yi.

547
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,130
Zhu Yi, are you okay?

548
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,290
What's wrong?

549
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,070
Jiuli...

550
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,730
Did Jiuli come to you?

551
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,430
Why?

552
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,750
I can't explain it to you now.

553
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,400
He got angry with me

554
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,620
because I lied to him.

555
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,160
It's good that he didn't come to you.

556
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,930
Angry?

557
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,610
I'm not happy, either.

558
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,210
Is he looking for me? Come on.

559
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,790
[Mr. Gu]

560
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,380
What should I do? I...

561
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,490
Gu Jiuli, you are a violent person.

562
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,030
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

563
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,050
Does Dan still need to report to you

564
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,920
what she's doing at night?

565
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,660
Let me tell you.

566
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,030
I'm at the basketball court of Hudu University.

567
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,940
Are you looking for me?

568
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Hit me if you want.

569
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,950
Zhu Yi, what are you doing?

570
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,300
I'm taking it out for you.

571
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,740
You...

572
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,420
How could this happen?

573
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,080
