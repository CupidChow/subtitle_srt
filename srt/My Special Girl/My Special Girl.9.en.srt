Can you let me go now?

Xiaojiu.

Yes, Master.

20
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,610
Mr. Gu, let me get you a glass of water.

Come here.

22
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:36,990
Sit.

23
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,030
I'm going to tie your hair into a bun for you.

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,670
Don't move.

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,430
No, no, no.

26
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,230
No need.

27
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,950
Sit down.

28
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,740
Let me see.

29
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,710

31
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,830
Calm down.

32
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,680
You can't push him down.

33
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,870
You just can't.

34
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,120
Alright. Come on.

35
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,830
Let me take a photo and show it to Yuan and the others.

36
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,680
No, no, no. Don't do this.

37
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,070
Just let me take a photo.

38
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't move. Let me just take one photo.

39
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,330
Let me take...

40
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,680

Of course.

Do you really...

132
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,450
have no feelings at all?

133
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,560
Last night,

134
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,850
you drank a lot of Sake.

135
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,110
Do you remember that?

136
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,760
How dare you mention that?

137
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,150
You know I can't drink Sake.

138
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,740
You still ordered it?

139
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,440
I wasn't the one who ordered it.

140
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
Your subordinates wanted to drink it.

141
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,050
I just couldn't tell them

142
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,830
"No, no, no".

143
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,510
"Your Mr. Gu can drink anything

144
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,470
but Sake."

145
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,910
"He will get drunk after drinking one cup of Sake."

146
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,830
Besides,

147
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,480
if you had not been drunk,

148
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,540
you wouldn't have had the guts to hook up with Hao Liang.

149
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,710
Hao Liang sent me back home?

150
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,140
Where is she?

151
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,280
You asked me? How would I know?

152
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,400
Could it be that

153
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,360
after you got drunk last night, you blacked out

154
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,290
and did something inappropriate?

155
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,250
Go away.

156
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,600
It's okay.

157
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,120
It was inevitable after drinking some wine.

158
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,270
When you get to the company,

159
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,620
explain it to Hao Liang carefully,

160
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,620
and it'll be fine.

161
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,480
I did black out,

162
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,680
but I wasn't a vegetative patient.

163
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,710
Nothing happened

164
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,430
between Hao Liang and me yesterday.

165
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,110
How boring.

166
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,490
But let me tell you.

167
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,190
Though you're sure that nothing happened,

168
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,110
it doesn't mean that

169
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,570
you didn't talk nonsense.

170
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,430
What would I say?

171
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,540
I wasn't at home.

172
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,010
How would I know

173
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,810
what you two were talking about?

174
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,910
Do you like me?

175
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,000
Did you tell the truth after getting drunk?

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,800
Did you confess your love to her?

177
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,110
Gosh.

178
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,390
Did you really confess your love to her?

179
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,660
I'm so curious about

180
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,390
how Hao Liang answered you.

181
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,930
Just recall it now.

182
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,790
I want to know, too.

183
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,840
This is not okay.

184
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,870
My purpose will be too obvious in this way.

185
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,710
If Jie and the others see this,

186
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,350
they will gossip again.

187
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,380
Perfect.

188
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,030
Littering?

189
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,500
This is not like Mr. Gu's style.

190
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,350
It's not good to peep at

191
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,110
his privacy secretly.

192
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,440
I'll just take one look.

193
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,430
I'll take one look.

194
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,960
No matter what secret it is,

195
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,480
I promise I won't tell anyone about it.

196
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,130
[Weighted Matrix of Romantic Love]

197
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,070
A psychological test?

198
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,020
He's also

199
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,730
that inquisitive in private?

200
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,150
January 1, 2000.

201
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,630
Oh my god.

202
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,520
Isn't this my birthday?

203
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,030
Could it be...

204
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,190
Three points?

205
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,580
Am I Ugly Betty?

206
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,780
At least,

207
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,220
I should be above the passing score.

208
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,750
I'm just not good at Higher Mathematics.

209
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,480
My grades in other subjects are excellent, okay?

210
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,220
Does Mr. Gu also think that

211
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,510
a person's IQ is embodied

212
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,040
in his performance in math?

213
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,470
Is that why he only gave me two points?

214
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,270
36 points.

215
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,510
Am I that bad

216
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,790
in your heart?

217
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,790
Hao Liang.

218
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,070
Hao Liang!

219
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,150
Hao Liang!

220
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,430
Lend me a pen.

221
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,980
What's wrong with you?

222
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,240
You look listless.

223
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,570
I'm fine.

224
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,210
Thank you for your concern, Mouth.

225
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,430
Mr. Gu.

226
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,360
-Mr. Gu. -Mr. Gu.

227
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,870
He really doesn't like me.

228
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,430
He doesn't even want the gift I gave him.

229
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,150
What's wrong with you?

230
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,950
Give it to me.

231
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,070
You want it?

232
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,310
It's okay.

233
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,950
It doesn't matter if you want it.

234
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,390
You're right.

235
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,920
Mr. Gu likes you so much.

236
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
You can ask him for it.

237
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,820
Don't talk nonsense.

238
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,500
Words are but wind, but seeing is believing.

239
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,130
How was it going between

240
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,530
you and Mr. Gu last night?

241
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,980
C.

242
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,760
There's nothing between Mr. Gu and me.

243
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,670
Please

244
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,150
don't make fun of us again.

245
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,230
But you two were like that last night.

246
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,700
Last night...

247
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,750
Last night, Mr. Gu was drunk.

248
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,120
Good morning, everyone.

249
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,670
Good morning.

250
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,930
Good morning.

251
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,800
We'll soon finish assembling the new engine

252
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,530
for Xiaojiu.

253
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,910
Do you feel excited and happy?

254
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,470
Yes!

255
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,090
Of course.

256
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,310
Alright.

257
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,930
Let's get ready and begin.

258
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,230
Everybody!

259
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,600
Before the historic

260
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,140
assembling for our Jiuqian,

261
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,390
let me show you something first.

262
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:39,870
No!

263
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,560
I want to see the engine.

264
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,750
What I want to show you

265
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,110
is related to our work.

266
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,000
Hurry up.

267
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,950
Hasn't Mr. Gu always criticized me that

268
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,580
the sensitivity of the program is not enough?

269
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,930
I finally found the reason.

270
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,260
Just tell us the reason.

271
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,550
Dan, you were...

272
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,070
Have you noticed that

273
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,410
this photo

274
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,190
contains abundant expressions?

275
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,869
Dan,

276
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,079
you like the beverages of a certain brand.

277
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,420
But why did you

278
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,500
have that unfathomable expression?

279
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,950
You put the gift which Hao Liang had given to you

280
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,280
in the pantry and shared it with everyone?

281
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,950
I found that all the beverages had been consumed,

282
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,510
so I felt a little depressed.

283
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,910
You were not just depressed.

284
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,530
You looked grief-stricken.

285
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,070
Really?

286
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,710
Yes.

287
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,330
Maybe I...

288
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,700
I just like them so much.

289
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,450
You like a box of beverages

290
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,850
so much that you feel sad?

291
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,270
Just ignore me.

292
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,760
I was just too bored.

293
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,790
It's funny to see it now.

294
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,870
Right?

295
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,000
Since you like it,

296
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,910
let's ask Ms. Hu to replenish these beverages.

297
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,780
No need.

298
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,710
They've all been consumed.

299
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,550
We must replenish these beverages.

300
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,410
Look at you. You were about to cry.

301
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,540
Mr. Gu, right? We have to replenish these beverages.

302
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,110
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,160
I don't feel quite comfortable wearing these contact lenses.

304
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,490
Go take a look at her now.

305
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,430
Go take a look.

306
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,750
What's going on?

307
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,470
They displayed their affection towards each other yesterday, didn't they?

308
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,680
Today, they look as if they didn't know each other.

309
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,350
They displayed their affection towards each other?

310
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,350
Who are you talking about?

311
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,310
Are you an idiot?

312
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,870
Can't you sense that Mr. Gu and Hao Liang...

313
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,380
Well, yesterday, at the karaoke bar, I...

314
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,860
You made Mr. Gu lose a chance

315
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,310
to kiss a girl openly and justifiably.

316
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,110
No, no, no.

317
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,150
Keep your voice down.

318
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,430
I didn't know that.

319
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,430
Mr. Gu, I'm fine.

320
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,830
My contact lenses are just a bit slippery.

321
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,560
I'm okay now.

322
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,380
Come with me.

323
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,180
That box of beverages I gave him is still here.

324
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,300
So that box of beverages in the pantry

325
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,630
wasn't put there by him?

326
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,190
He didn't give my gift

327
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,730
to others.

328
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,340
Mr. Gu.

329
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm bringing you the pressure relief straws.

330
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,740
So you've got some of them

331
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,310
from me?

332
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,560
Then I'll put them here for you first.

333
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,670
Actually, I...

334
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,330
Mr. Gu, we're waiting for you.

335
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,230
Let's go there first.

336
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,080
Yuan.

337
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,070
Are you very nervous?

338
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,830
If we fail,

339
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,910
what will happen?

340
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,700
Nothing serious will happen.

341
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,760
The company will go bankrupt at most.

342
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,230
Then Mr. Gu will have to go back home to inherit the family business.

343
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,230
But if we succeed,

344
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,790
we'll be rich.

345
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,590
If we succeed,

346
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,830
it means he'll fill the gap in this field

347
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,030
or create history.

348
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,430
He's so brilliant.

349
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,470
No wonder he only gave me 36 points.

350
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,870
The system is being updated.

351
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,310
The system is being updated.

352
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,790
The system is being updated.

353
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,120
The system has been updated.

354
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,010
Alright. Let's start testing it.

355
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,230
Hao Liang, just do it.

356
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,870
How should I test it?

357
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,960
Give it an order.

358
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,190
I'm hungry.

359
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,320
Are you a pig?

360
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,030
All you know is eating.

361
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,550
Miss, are you hungry?

362
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,830
You look a bit pale.

363
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,330
You must have stayed up late again recently.

364
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,070
-It could even perceive that? -Amazing.

365
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,730
You're the one who looks pale.

366
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,650
This is indeed the program

367
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,390
which Jie participated in developing.

368
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,590
It's so annoying.

369
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,440
I've placed the order for you.

370
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,790
In 15 minutes,

371
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,440
pay on delivery of the food.

372
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,240
It placed the order directly?

373
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,070
It placed the order automatically.

374
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,670
Go on.

375
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,870
Well, I also want a cup of soft drinks.

376
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,310
Miss,

377
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,210
if you want to drink juice,

378
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,250
I recommend

379
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
the New Fruits Snow Tea here.

380
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,990
They have this soft drink of

381
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,200
kiwi and aloe juice.

382
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,080
It suits people like you

383
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,360
who suffer from the problem of hair loss.

384
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,510
Hair loss?

385
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,210
No, I don't have this problem.

386
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,930
No soft drinks.

387
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,990
Change them to strawberry milkshakes.

388
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,650
Okay.

389
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,910
Young man,

390
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,000
if you drink strawberry milkshakes right after a meal,

391
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,110
you'll suffer from diarrhea easily.

392
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,390
I want to drink it.

393
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,460
Then I'll order a portion of

394
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,510
full-sugar strawberry milkshakes for you.

395
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,150
Okay?

396
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,300
This was the dessert

397
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,560
which you ate most frequently last year.

398
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,310
We did it! We did it!

399
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,070
Good.

400
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,750
Mr. Gu,

401
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,880
Xiaojiu can not only

402
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,510
identify genders through voices,

403
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,490
but also give dietary advice to human beings.

404
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,670
It has greatly improved

405
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,270
in interactive activities.

406
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,200
Why don't you think about who developed it?

407
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,990
It was Jie who developed it.

408
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,300
Jie, teach me.

409
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,870
No.

410
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,490
You're much better than C.

411
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,460
Hurry up.

412
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,070
Cut the power!

413
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,390
Jie, cut the power!

414
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:32,940
Hurry up!

415
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,860
Cut the power!

416
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,150
Mouth!

417
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,780
I've taken out the hard disks

418
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,710
and the interfaces which have been burnt.

419
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,790
Let's try again.

420
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,230
No need.

421
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,430
The result will still be the same.

422
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,150
The problem lies in the new system.

423
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:17,830
Look here.

424
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,590
When it deals with

425
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,720
the third question,

426
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,350
there will be the problem of memory overflow,

427
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,180
which will lead to these two

428
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,380
logical loop errors.

429
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,620
If there are more than three questions,

430
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,950
Xiaojiu will collapse.

431
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,570
But I've obviously repaired

432
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,410
all the bugs.

433
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,670
It's not a bug.

434
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,160
The problem is that the configuration of the program and the hardware

435
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,620
isn't compatible enough.

436
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,290
When we developed

437
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,990
the first generation of Non Human Engine,

438
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,920
it was based on

439
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,080
PC hardware design.

440
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,980
When we developed the second generation,

441
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,800
in order to pursue the goal of

442
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,600
high-IQ AI,

443
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,910
we ignored the hardware environment

444
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,840
which it needed.

445
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,220
Xiaojiu's computing capabilities and internal storage

446
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,850
can't reach

447
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,590
the computing power requirements of the 2.5 version at all.

448
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,660
What if we upgrade its CPU,

449
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,670
expand its internal storage,

450
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,670
and install a larger and faster

451
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,530
hard disk in it?

452
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,790
It'll still be quite difficult.

453
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,780
Xiaojiu is a program

454
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,950
driven by batteries.

455
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,340
No matter how much you upgrade it,

456
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,950
it can't be

457
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,750
compared with those personal computers

458
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,410
with high power consumption.

459
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,390
Bro,

460
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,910
I have to say something that you don't want to hear.

461
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,510
You're a genius programmer.

462
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,210
But Xiaojiu

463
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,340
can't accommodate your imagination.

464
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,030
No.

465
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,290
There must be a way.

466
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,990
Here are 20 cups of

467
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,350
strawberry milkshakes ordered by Mr. Gu.

468
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,230
Thank you.

469
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,350
I'll just give up.

470
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,880
What are you talking about?

471
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,870
I already said that

472
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,070
it was impossible to make a self-created engine.

473
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,560
But Mr. Gu insisted on doing it.

474
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,090
Fine. We just put up with it.

475
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,840
But what happened in the end?

476
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,900
You all saw it, too.

477
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,120
How did Mr. Gu react to it?

478
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,720
He only casually said that

479
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,990
we could modify it, and it would be fine.

480
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,510
How should we modify it?

481
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,710
How should we do that?

482
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,590
Alright.

483
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,310
You all trust him.

484
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,470
I'll give up.

485
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,960
What about you guys?

486
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,620
Just forget it.

487
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,360
Master Ka,

488
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,430
aren't you just making things difficult for us by asking this question?

489
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,030
Big Mouth.

490
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,300
You don't trust Mr. Gu as well, do you?

491
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,430
But you also saw what happened just now.

492
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,360
It's not that we don't trust Mr. Gu.

493
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,590
But after we had worked hard for so long, was it useful?

494
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,590
What is trust?

495
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,630
Trust means that even if the whole world

496
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,800
thinks that Mr. Gu can't do it,

497
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,860
we'll still trust him

498
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,900
and support him.

499
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,390
Before I joined Jiuqian,

500
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,960
I was in a miserable condition.

501
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,270
In order to make money,

502
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,130
I became a surrogate exam-taker.

503
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,450
The school found out about it,

504
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,310
and I was fired.

505
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,870
During that time,

506
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,300
my grandma was still in hospital,

507
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,030
waiting for money for surgery.

508
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,200
In this case, I made a fake resume

509
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,810
and came to Jiuqian for an interview.

510
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,150
Mr. Gu saw through my tricks with just one look.

511
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,350
But he still hired me.

512
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,950
If it weren't for him,

513
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,990
I might still be a webmaster

514
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,790
at an Internet cafe at this time.

515
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,350
So he helped me

516
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,760
in my most difficult times.

517
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,030
You know very well

518
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,430
how Mr. Gu treats you.

519
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,360
Doesn't Mr. Gu treat you guys well?

520
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,470
So,

521
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,490
no matter what decision

522
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,750
Mr. Gu makes finally,

523
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,080
I'll still work for him.

524
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,710
Actually, there's one more thing

525
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,590
which I haven't told you guys all the time.

526
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,050
Last time when we had a gathering at the Bund,

527
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,200
Mr. Gu promised to give us bonuses.

528
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,150
But did any of you know that

529
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:02,910
our company

530
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,640
was on the verge of bankruptcy?

531
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,340
The investors withdrew their investment,

532
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,470
because Xiaojiu didn't pass the test.

533
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,950
But he still gave you the bonuses on the next day.

534
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,210
Who offered the money?

535
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,730
Mr. Gu paid for the bonuses himself.

536
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,330
This is called trust. This is called a promise.

537
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,000
What about you guys?

538
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,790
Nearly all of you

539
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,190
want to give up now,

540
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,200
Just like you guys,

541
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,650
I don't understand the decision Mr. Gu has made this time.

542
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,830
I even feel dissatisfied.

543
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,990
But I trust him.

544
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,010
Because I've worked for him for five years,

545
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,870
and I know him and understand him.

546
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,670
I believe that he must have

547
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,140
his own reason to do this.

548
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,660
Mr. Fei,

549
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,670
what should we do now?

550
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,220
The Infinity Team.

551
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:00,710
Yes.

552
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,020
The Infinity Team

553
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,350
is our last hope.

554
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,750
But they've been hiding themselves so well.

555
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,150
Where can we find them?

556
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,070
Let's go on looking for them.

557
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,190
I don't believe that

558
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,120
they can disappear from our Earth.

559
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,870
Right.

560
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,990
Let's go on looking for them.

561
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,960
My father

562
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,240
called me two days ago.

563
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,010
The Hua's Group

564
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,390
held a quarterly meeting.

565
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,060
He said they also wanted to get involved

566
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,630
in the field of artificial intelligence.

567
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,030
No.

568
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,140
I didn't say anything special and you already said no?

569
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,250
Mr. Fei suggested this to me many times,

570
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,650
but I refused every time.

571
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,070
The stubbornness of an old man

572
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,600
is really a tricky problem.

573
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,960
Just give me three days.

574
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,050
I'll definitely find a solution.

575
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:39,770
Gu.

576
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,950
You have a love rival.

577
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,000
Let's go now.

578
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,080
Let's go.

579
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,120
Are you in a bad mood?

580
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,710
I'm fine.

581
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,260
I won't tell you then.

582
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,750
What?

583
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,350
Nothing. Let's eat.

584
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,810
Come on.

585
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,110
Say it.

586
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,400
Actually, I'm here today

587
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,440
to see Swede.

588
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,360
Qixiu's technical maintenance engineer?

589
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,870
The ranking list of this month has been announced.

590
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,570
Have I fallen out of the Top Three?

591
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,980
Forget it. Let's talk about it another day.

592
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,180
I beg you, Zhu Yi.

593
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,900
Jut tell me.

594
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,390
I can bear it.

595
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,430
You rank 13th.

596
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,670
I've fallen out of the Top Ten?

597
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,510
It's okay.

598
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,800
Swede also said that

599
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,430
this time,

600
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,710
in your online interaction with Cute Mengmeng,

601
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,230
you lost,

602
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,550
so the number of your fans decreased so rapidly.

603
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,530
But it's all right.

604
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,510
You'll have an online interaction with her again in three days.

605
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,200
As long as you defeat her,

606
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,080
you'll be fine.

607
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,550
How can I defeat her?

608
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,560
How can you defeat her?

609
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,870
Just take measures according to the actual situation.

610
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,010
What if she asks me to bark

611
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,690
like a dog?

612
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,550
Then just do it.

613
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,190
What if she asks me to crawl like a dog?

614
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,800
Then just do it.

615
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,660
What if she asks me to eat dog shit?

616
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,340
Just eat it.

617
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,660
The webmaster won't agree.

618
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,550
Well, what's wrong with you?

619
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,330
Normally, Ms. Dai

620
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,860
isn't so cowardly like you.

621
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,150
Our company's new project

622
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,230
hasn't been going well recently.

623
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,960
What does it have to do with you?

624
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,070
That's our company.

625
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,770
Look at you. You should care more about

626
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,830
your own business.

627
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,870
Don't cry by that time.

628
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,590
I won't.

629
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,150
If you don't drink it, just give it to me. Don't waste it.

630
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,150
It became deformed after you bit it.

631
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,450
There's something wrong with her.

632
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,050
Do you think...

633
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,710
Do you think Hao Liang

634
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,760
truly likes me?

635
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,080
Even blind people can sense it.

636
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,710
According to my feelings

637
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,890
and my ongoing dating experience

638
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
in romantic love,

639
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,470
Bro, let me tell you.

640
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,990
Hao Liang definitely has feelings for you.

641
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,560
However,

642
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,650
there is positive and negative feedback about everything.

643
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,870
If Hao Liang has to devote herself to the relationship

644
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,400
unilaterally all the time,

645
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,070
she might change her mind.

646
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,310
Just go say hello.

647
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,850
Mind your own business.

648
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,510
Excuse me.

649
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,090
A gentleman

650
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,490
ordered two cups of milkshakes for you two.

651
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,310
Someone ordered milkshakes for us?

652
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,940
Could it be that someone

653
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,750
is coveting my beauty,

654
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,630
so she gave them to me as a gift?

655
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,950
You're thinking too much.

656
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,810
I'll treat you to this milkshake.

657
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,750
You've paid the bill.

658
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,230
You've also sent the gifts to them.

659
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,930
Why didn't you go over there

660
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,230
and say something to them?

661
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,430
What's your purpose?

662
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,970
Those are staff benefits.

663
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,440
Alright. Let me tell you.

664
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,290
One day, you'll have to beg me.

665
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,760
Just go on pretending.

666
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:28,950
Dan.

667
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,570
Mr. Gu wants to see you.

668
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,950
Mr. Gu, are you looking for me?

669
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,600
Where were you just now

670
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,790
during working hours?

671
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,630
I...

672
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,270
I'm sorry.

673
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,030
Why are you apologizing?

674
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,910
I spent some of my working time

675
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,830
meeting a friend.

676
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,710
Mr. Gu, I won't do it again.

677
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,960
What kind of friend?

678
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,240
Just a good friend.

679
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,670
How close is the relationship between you?

680
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,110
From now on, don't spend your working time

681
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,909
dealing with personal matters.

682
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,770
I'll get back to work then.

683
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,440
Wait.

684
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,469
Is there anything else?

685
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,469
Don't leave after work.

686
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,290
Have you forgotten it?

687
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,080
I'll tutor you in your studies.

688
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,670
Mr. Gu, if you're busy with something else,

689
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,370
-you don't have to tutor me in...
-I don't have anything else to do.

690
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,330
I promised you that

691
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,110
I would help you so that you could

692
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,060
get more than 100 points in your make-up exam.

693
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,260
I'll keep my promise.

694
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,630
It's something that he has promised me.

695
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,219
It turns out that he'll tutor me in my studies

696
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,670
because he has to keep his promise.

697
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,280
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

698
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,420
I'll study hard.

699
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,950
I have to go.

700
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,230
Coming.

701
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,270
What's wrong?

702
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,000
Jie,

703
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,710
can you

704
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,900
tell us the truth?

705
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,210
What's wrong with the new engine?

706
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,470
Gu doesn't allow me to tell you.

707
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,450
How can I tell you the truth?

708
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,280
You still have to trust your Mr. Gu.

709
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,800
We trust him.

710
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,060
The new engine isn't reliable, is it?

711
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,510
Is this your attitude towards trusting him?

712
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,890
I believe that Mr. Gu can definitely

713
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,070
develop a new engine.

714
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,550
Look.

715
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,090
Hao Liang's attitude

716
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,790
is the correct way of supporting him.

717
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,030
Dan doesn't even understand

718
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,550
the basic programming language.

719
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,360
Her suggestions can be ignored.

720
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,980
Right.

721
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,670
So we must

722
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,010
take action at once.

723
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,120
So what should we do?

724
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,780
Do you know the Infinity Team?

725
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,130
What do you guys want to do?

726
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,490
If Mr. Gu could really

727
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,840
develop this engine,

728
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,690
we wouldn't have

729
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,840
waited till now.

730
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,430
Throughout the history of the Internet world,

731
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,500
things have been changing rapidly for decades.

732
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Now the only possible

733
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,510
new engine

734
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,100
for our Xiaojiu is

735
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,750
the Non Human engine.

736
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,630
You're using it now.

737
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,330
You idiots.

738
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,470
What do you want to do?

739
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,020
Firstly,

740
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,070
we should go on looking for the Infinity Team.

741
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,750
Secondly,

742
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,470
we hope that

743
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,550
you can persuade Mr. Gu.

744
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,820
According to the news provided by a reliable informant,

745
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,550
the Infinity Team graduated from

746
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,470
the Computer Department of Stanford University in America

747
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,200
12 years ago.

748
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,390
If I remember it correctly,

749
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,550
you and Mr. Gu

750
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,280
also graduated from Stanford.

751
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,680
Yes.

752
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,120
We've asked a friend

753
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,680
to set up an extensive network

754
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,770
near them.

755
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,430
We must arrest them

756
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,340
this time.

757
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,190
If you don't know how to use idioms properly, just don't use them.

758
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,790
Jie.

759
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,320
You're a graduate from Stanford, aren't you?

760
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,190
Use your resources

761
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,310
to help us find them.

762
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,280
Right.

763
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,390
I have no resources.

764
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,230
Well, you...

765
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,430
The relationship between your classmates is that bad?

766
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,070
Jie,

767
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,600
your mission is that

768
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,990
once we find them,

769
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,640
you'll be in charge of

770
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,950
persuading Mr. Gu.

771
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,630
I want to ask you.

772
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,520
Why do you think that

773
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,080
Gu Jiuli can't create a new engine?

774
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,000
Yes, why?

775
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,700
Your Mr. Gu doesn't treat you well in vain.

776
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,230
Love can really make a person become so blind.

777
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,560
It's not like that.

778
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,270
Are you admitting that

779
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,710
you and Mr. Gu are in love?

780
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,940
Don't always make jokes about

781
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,910
Mr. Gu and me.

782
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,860
This is not good.

783
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,440
I mean,

784
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,200
Mr. Gu can do it.

785
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,970
When you guys tutored me in math,

786
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,170
I didn't understand.

787
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,750
But when Mr. Gu tutored me,

788
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,910
I understood.

789
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,320
You compared creating a new engine

790
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,710
to your studies in Higher Mathematics.

791
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,030
How shameless you are.

792
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,670
Don't be so rude while you're talking.

793
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,740
I trust him.

794
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,030
But we don't have much time now.

795
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,830
Right.

796
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,870
Mr. Gu promised the investors that he would spend

797
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,620
two months developing the new engine.

798
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,830
Half of the time has passed.

799
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,630
So, Jie,

800
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,150
you must say yes to

801
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,110
our request.

802
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,750
Okay.

803
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,690
Then you guys should go find the Infinity Team first,

804
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,210
and then we can talk about it.

805
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,040
Okay. Let's start taking action.

806
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,700
No problem.

807
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,440
Let's go.

808
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,640
It's impossible that you guys can find the Infinity Team.

809
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,430
Could you please help me investigate

810
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,470
this team called...

811
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,230
Mr. Fei.

812
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,430
Is it true that we really don't have much time now?

813
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:25,920
Yes.

814
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,040
But your job

815
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,550
should still be done according to the original plan.

816
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,350
What if...

817
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,240
I mean it's just a possibility.

818
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,870
What if the final result isn't good

819
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,980
after the investors check it?

820
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,010
Actually, to Mr. Gu,

821
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,080
Xiaojiu is not just a career,

822
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,690
but also his dream.

823
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,030
Stop being obsessed with him.

824
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,830
He doesn't like you.

825
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,310
In his heart,

826
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,030
you're only worth

827
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,610
such a low score.

828
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,110
What are you thinking about?

829
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,270
Nothing.

830
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,810
I made a phone call just now,

831
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,670
so I'm late.

832
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,230
It's all right.

833
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,150
Mr. Gu, if you're busy with something else,

834
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,430
you don't have to tutor me.

835
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,620
This is my promise.

836
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,870
I was drunk last night.

837
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,070
Did I...

838
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,270
say anything special to you?
