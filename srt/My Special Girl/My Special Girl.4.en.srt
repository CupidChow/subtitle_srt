[My Special Girl]

00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,039
[Episode 4]

4
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,720
You mean,

5
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,490
in the control room of the live broadcast...

6
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:12,970
Yes.

7
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,010
It's all him.

8
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,690
He registered an account under my name

9
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,720
and contacted you in private.

10
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,350
He also gave you a gift

11
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,300
and asked you out in my name.

12
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,090
If you hadn't given me

13
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,530
the room number that day,

14
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,770
if it weren’t

15
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,120
that there was no trash can,

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,079
so I could only take it back to the office and throw it away,

17
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,630
and if it weren't that my friend

18
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,690
happened to see it,

19
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,600
all the misunderstandings

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
wouldn't have happened.

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
Forget about him.

22
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,520
What about you?

23
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,820
Me?

24
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,870
Don't you

25
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,950
have any feelings for me?

26
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,290
I admit

27
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,800
compared to your colleagues,

28
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,950
you're indeed more tactful.

29
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,660
But I have no interest in you.

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,420
During the fire drill,

31
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,950
you were lazy and wanted to take the elevator.

32
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,150
What a coincidence.

33
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,740
You like this shop's soufflé too?

34
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,020
I happened to buy two more boxes.

35
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,730
One for you.

36
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,970
You don't like sweet food,

37
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,750
but you pretend to like it.

38
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,740
You put on heavy makeup

39
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,510
and sing in front of the camera.

40
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,079
All your actions

41
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,579
make me feel

42
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,230
you're pretentious.

43
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,079
I am not interested in internet celebrities like you,

44
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,920
who wear heavy makeup under the spotlight,

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,079
sing strange songs,

46
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,970
and are still adored by fans,

47
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,930
neither in the past, nor now,

48
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,510
nor in the future.

49
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,250
What is this?

50
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,250
I don’t like owing others.

51
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,970
Is it the access card of Jiuqian

52
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,970
that Han gave you?

53
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,700
I admit

54
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,360
I fell in love with you at first sight.

55
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,269
I like you.

56
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,550
I tried my best to chase you.

57
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
If this bothers you,

58
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,780
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,040
From now on,

60
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,540
I won't do it anymore.

61
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,120
But

62
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,890
what do you mean by saying that I'm an internet celebrity

63
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,020
who wears heavy makeup under the spotlight,

64
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,330
sings strange songs,

65
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,409
and is adored by fans?

66
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,210
Is this

67
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,140
how you perceive my job?

68
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,360
Do you believe

69
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,590
we depend on using our appearance

70
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,320
to win favor for personal gain?

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,350
Just last month,

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,280
a second-year graduate student

73
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,340
was in agony from conducting experiments.

74
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,800
He was depressed and wanted to kill himself.

75
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,040
He came to my live stream room and said goodbye.

76
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,750
In the end, I used my voice

77
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,830
to stop him from committing suicide.

78
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,820
You don't have to like me,

79
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,930
but you can't belittle my job.

80
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,330
Although I like you,

81
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,510
we are equal.

82
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,450
The class is over.

83
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,780
What are you doing here?

84
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:31,780
Also,

85
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,330
where are your books?

86
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,930
Where are the books I asked you to bring?

87
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,070
I just had to persuade Thunderbolt Woman a lot,

88
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,620
and finally, she agreed to stay for an extra ten minutes.

89
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,260
But what time is it now?

90
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,790
What's the use of apologizing?

92
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,830
You're the one who failed.

93
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,130
It's you who can't graduate.

94
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,659
It has nothing to do with me.

95
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,450
Li..

96
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,260
Hello.

97
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,430
You can't reach Dai?

98
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,130
She's with me.

99
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,420
What?

100
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,410
I...

101
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:11,750
This...

102
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,140
This...

103
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,920
The big boss invited Cute Mengmeng

104
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,740
to battle with you.

105
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,140
Only the winner

106
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,200
can attend the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,840
Who's Cute Mengmeng?

108
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,060
Who else?

109
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,880
The top female streamer on Doumao.

110
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,370
Her number of fans is 3.5 million.

111
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,890
Mr. Niu just recruited her.

112
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,820
They already signed the contract.

113
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,210
We must battle with her.

114
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,090
I only have hundreds of thousands of fans.

115
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,700
Do you want to give in?

116
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,340
It should have ended.

117
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,840
I shouldn't

118
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
fantasize about things

119
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,780
that don't belong to me at all.

120
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,380
A person like me, who is both cowardly and foolish,

121
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,530
why should I go...

122
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
Fight for?

123
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,380
Sorry, Zhu Yi.

124
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,720
Sorry for the trouble.

125
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,850
I'm leaving.

126
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,650
Do you need a ride?

127
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,490
Gu.

128
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,170
I have

129
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,610
a big secret to announce.

130
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,340
Beg me.

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,190
Have you been wanting me to beg you for a long time?

132
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,500
Yes.

133
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,659
I won't beg you. I'll let you suffer from keeping the secret.

134
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,970
Aren't you bored?

135
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,960
What kind of attitude is that?

136
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,220
Just tell me.

137
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,300
I met my next girlfriend.

138
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,670
Please come in.

139
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,070
Have a seat.

140
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,690
Excuse me,

141
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,260
are you Jiuli?

142
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,260
Dai?

143
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,670
Sorry, I'm late.

144
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,460
Actually,

145
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
it's my honor

146
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,580
to wait for a beautiful lady.

147
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,630
Slowly.

148
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,320
Sorry.

149
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,500
So you're really Jiuli?

150
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,510
My friends call me Owen.

151
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,010
What would you like to drink?

152
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,280
Warm water. Thank you.

153
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,810
Okay, please wait a moment.

154
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,220
Dai,

155
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,040
you seem a bit different from how you look

156
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,840
on the screen.

157
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,800
The four illusion techniques in Asia.

158
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,600
You know them.

159
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,160
I know.

160
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
The beauty camera popular in China.

161
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,490
But how can the beauty camera

162
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,220
even change your temperament?

163
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,230
It's hard to park around here.

164
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,470
How did you get here?

165
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,940
I walked here.

166
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,330
You walked here?

167
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,780
You live nearby?

168
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,720
The house price in this neighborhood is expensive.

169
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,250
I live at my friend's house.

170
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,060
He doesn't have a car or a house.

171
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,320
What kind of boss is he?

172
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,420
Is his business just a shell company?

173
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,180
Humph.

174
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,300
Gu guessed right.

175
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,650
She's beating around the bush trying to find out

176
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,960
about my financial situation.

177
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,860
You are not cunning enough yet.

178
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,750
Owen.

179
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,090
What're your

180
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,690
hobbies?

181
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,100
Clubbing,

182
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,870
playing games,

183
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,460
riding motorcycle,

184
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,780
and diving.

185
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,290
A playboy.

186
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,040
A gold digger.

187
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,050
Although most employees in technology companies

188
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,080
are male,

189
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,650
there are also female employees, right?

190
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,090
Yes.

191
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,770
I think so.

192
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,400
It's fine there are.

193
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,650
What do you mean by you think so?

194
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,370
Girls from a tech company.

195
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,240
You know them.

196
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,090
Their appearance is forgettable.

197
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,150
Forget about them.

198
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,430
Let's talk about you.

199
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,310
I'm more interested in you.

200
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,060
You mean

201
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,920
you have no interest

202
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,770
in your company's female employees?

203
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,880
Strictly speaking,

204
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,630
I'm not sure whether

205
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,820
they can be considered as girls.

206
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,500
How could I

207
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,450
like them?

208
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,670
I prefer girls with personality.

209
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,400
Dear customers,

210
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,440
our afternoon tea time

211
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
will be over soon.

212
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,400
Are you going to have dinner here?

213
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,940
You spoke ill of my Dan.

214
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,390
I'll fleece you.

215
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,730
This one.

216
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,820
I think

217
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,680
this is not bad.

218
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,100
You have good taste.

219
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:40,780
This

220
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,250
is our best set.

221
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,260
Do you think I'm a fool

222
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,580
that you can exploit at will?

223
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,540
In your dreams.

224
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,700
Do you know Jennifer, the gourmet?

225
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,500
I already paid, boss.

226
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,210
Okay.

227
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:03,960
Take care.

228
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,230
See you next time.

229
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:05,850
Uncle Ma.

230
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,100
Jie.

231
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,400
Long time no see.

232
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,180
As usual.

233
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,510
Okay.

234
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,750
I've prepared it for you.

235
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,610
How can he treat a girl street food when he's courting her?

236
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,250
No.

237
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,270
I have to dump this miser

238
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,360
for Dan.

239
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,120
See what you want to eat.

240
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,060
I'm not used to

241
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,000
the food here.

242
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,890
You don't like it?

243
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,300
No.

244
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,170
Of course not.

245
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,790
You're right.

246
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,660
Eat more later.

247
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,770
Okay.

248
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,040
Gold digger. You miscalculated.

249
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,730
Here's the seasoning.

250
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,500
Boss,

251
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,190
there is white sesame

252
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,220
in the minced coriander?

253
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,720
Yes.

254
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,590
My white sesame

255
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,970
was soaked in salt water.

256
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,120
It tastes good and has a strong taste.

257
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,850
Great idea!

258
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,120
It smells good.

259
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,670
Do you often eat at street stalls?

260
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,530
Of course not.

261
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,810
Miss, what would you like to order?

262
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,320
Paste-like soup noodles.

263
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,770
Chicken crown dumplings.

264
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,830
And some tofu skin.

265
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,340
Jie.

266
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,930
Just like what you would usually order.

267
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,800
Okay, I'll serve them right away.

268
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,900
You're good at ordering.

269
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,100
Here comes the tofu skin.

270
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,580
You think it's dirty?

271
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,060
Look, she is professional.

272
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,760
When the temperature of the paste-like soup noodles

273
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,880
is left at 80%, they taste the best.

274
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,310
Chicken crown dumplings and tofu skin are best

275
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,510
when left at 60% heat.

276
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,700
Boss.

277
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,300
The ratio of tofu skin, sticky rice,

278
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,530
and braising sauce in this

279
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,770
is just perfect.

280
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,190
There's a rule when eating tofu skin.

281
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,520
You must pair it with...

282
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,780
Green bean soup.

283
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,690
Okay, I'll serve it right away.

284
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,990
How could a playboy

285
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,290
be so down-to-earth?

286
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,430
Looks like Gu was wrong this time.

287
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,230
She is not a gold digger.

288
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,010
As a popular livestreamer,

289
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,570
you're here eating at a roadside stall.

290
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,600
If your fans find out,

291
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
would they be surprised?

292
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,700
There's never truly dark cuisine.

293
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,630
There's only dark culinary skill.

294
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Here, enjoy.

295
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,670
Is she your girlfriend?

296
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
What do you think?

297
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,140
Great.

298
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,220
I think so too.

299
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,830
In this day and age, a girl who looks beautiful

300
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,600
and is willing to accompany you

301
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,000
to eat at roadside stalls

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,240
is someone you should cherish.

303
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,900
You don't have to tell me that.

304
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,050
Boss, pack it for me.

305
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,080
Okay.

306
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,660
Did something happen?

307
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,680
It's packed.

308
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:12,920
How much?

309
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:13,970
Let me.

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,360
42.

311
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,450
Ma.

312
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,080
Thanks.

313
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,040
Okay.

314
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,790
Your girlfriend?

315
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,060
Yes, my girlfriend.

316
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,190
I guess she has something to do at home.

317
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,130
Would a girlfriend go Dutch with you?

318
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,030
I don't even have her WeChat account.

319
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,790
8818.

320
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,850
Of course.

321
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,780
So,

322
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,210
after I scolded her,

323
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,310
she went to see you again?

324
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,800
Shouldn't you ask me

325
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,830
about her height, weight,

326
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,160
what she looks like,

327
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,910
what her hobby is,

328
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,110
what she likes to eat,

329
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,410
and whether I can give you some advice

330
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,810
to help you take her down?

331
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,970
How about you help me plan

332
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,700
my wedding and honeymoon trip?

333
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,510
I've never thought about those, but it's okay.

334
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,570
You really have nothing better to do.

335
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,210
Do you think what you gave up

336
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,670
was just a simple meeting?

337
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:17,980
Gu Jiuli,

338
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,100
what you gave up

339
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,380
is an opportunity to live a happy life.

340
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,710
Fine.

341
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,700
Okay, end of conversation.

342
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,140
I want to say hello

343
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,710
to my sweetheart.

344
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,780
No way.

345
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,290
She blocked me.

346
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,750
Well done.

347
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,810
Dan.

348
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,690
You're home.

349
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,090
Let me tell you.

350
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,720
Luckily, you didn't go today.

351
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,950
Otherwise, he'll scam you

352
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,900
so thoroughly.

353
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:53,700
That man

354
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,920
is obviously a playboy.

355
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,070
And he's not

356
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,060
very smart.

357
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,940
Resign tomorrow. Resign right away.

358
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,140
Aunt Yibai.

359
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,240
What you saw is not him.

360
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,690
Well.

361
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,089
What happened?

362
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,270
Please don't ask anything.

363
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,869
Okay, baby.

364
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,520
I won't ask anymore.

365
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,200
Here.

366
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,360
This is not right.

367
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,270
Why is it wrong?

368
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,250
You still can't solve it?

369
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,770
I've taught you three times.

370
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,200
I won't teach you anymore.

371
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
I gave you all the signed photos from

372
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,000
the idol handshake event.

373
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,410
Let me take a break.

374
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,010
Here, Mouth.

375
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,510
Okay.

376
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,340
Thank you.

377
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,850
Let's switch seats.

378
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,930
Are they having a fight?

379
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Probably.

380
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,240
Mr. Gu,

381
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,740
we still want to

382
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,600
discuss with you

383
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,180
about Xiaojiu's sensitivity.

384
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,170
Our R&D department thinks

385
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,230
although Xiaojiu Engine's assessment

386
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,970
is not good,

387
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,790
innovating it

388
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,930
is like replacing

389
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,630
a bad plan

390
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,120
with another bad one.

391
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,040
What do you think

392
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,870
is the biggest problem now?

393
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,470
Language.

394
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,830
Yes.

395
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,570
In Chinese, each character or word

396
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,980
is the smallest processing unit.

397
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,770
But every character

398
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,770
can't be divided.

399
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,900
It's easy to

400
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,230
lead to semantic ambiguity.

401
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,030
So, when communicating,

402
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,410
there is a tendency for delays.

403
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,580
At present, modifications to the engine

404
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,440
are of no avail.

405
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,210
Can innovating the engine address the root cause?

406
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,940
I don't know.

407
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,360
But the existing engine is definitely not suitable.

408
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,630
What's wrong with the engine I made?

409
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,160
Tell me.

410
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,580
The assessment results

411
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,580
are not targeted at you personally.

412
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,350
I am responsible for compiling the main program.

413
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,010
Now, you...

414
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,290
Don't pull me.

415
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,350
I'm not afraid of him like you all are.

416
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,190
I am responsible for compiling the main program.

417
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,910
Listen.

418
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,960
If you go against it,

419
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,560
it's against me personally.

420
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,180
I will take full responsibility

421
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,830
for all the negative impacts

422
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,300
caused by this plan.

423
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,510
This issue will not be discussed any further.

424
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,260
Dismiss.

425
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,900
Make it clear.

426
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,090
C.

427
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
Calm down.

428
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,840
Why are you pulling me?

429
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,190
Do you know computer language?

430
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,690
Do you know

431
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,840
what we were talking about?

432
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,640
You know nothing.

433
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,480
Why are you helping him?

434
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:25,950
C.

435
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,710
There's no need.

436
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
You go back first.

437
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,300
You two stay.

438
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,540
I've always

439
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,010
refrained from interfering

440
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,740
in employees' personal lives.

441
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,710
So I'll only say this once.

442
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,540
Don't let work emotions

443
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,530
affect your love life.

444
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,020
What... What do you mean?

445
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,330
If he does this to you again,

446
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,270
just tell me.

447
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,990
Why did you nod?

448
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,050
He thinks we're a couple.

449
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,500
I don't care.

450
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,370
You have to make it clear to Mr. Gu

451
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,650
that we're not a couple.

452
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,540
What's the matter?

453
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,740
Mr. Gu, actually,

454
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,930
C and I

455
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,340
are not in a relationship.

456
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,050
Did he ask you to come to me?

457
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,500
C.

458
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,180
Come in.

459
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,930
Don't be a coward if you're a man.

460
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,750
Office romance is allowed in the company.

461
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,640
Mr. Gu, you misunderstood.

462
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,830
What did you tell Mr. Gu?

463
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,100
Why did you have to latch onto me?

464
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,570
I...

465
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,390
C.

466
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,530
Mr. Gu said

467
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,630
office romance is allowed.

468
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,330
Don't be so fierce.

469
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,480
Apologize to your baby.

470
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,050
Baby?

471
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,910
No, no, no.

472
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,890
It's okay.

473
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,650
Liang, don’t be afraid.

474
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
We’re on your side.

475
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,310
Yeah.

476
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,340
Yeah, don't spoil his temper.

477
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,900
What are you talking about?

478
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,890
Which eyes of yours

479
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,720
see us dating?

480
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,850
You two were together every noon.

481
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,910
Isn't that dating?

482
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,260
We were...

483
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,260
A soldier can be killed but not humiliated.

484
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,590
Everyone is here today.

485
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,090
You have to make it clear.

486
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,740
What exactly did we do

487
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,980
together?

488
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,370
Tell them.

489
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,850
He was tutoring me.

490
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,620
Tutoring?

491
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:13,940
For what?

492
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,420
Everyone,

493
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,050
this woman

494
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,110
got 69 points in Higher Mathematics test.

495
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,120
She bribed me with my idol's merchandise

496
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,520
and asked me to tutor her.

497
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,100
69?

498
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,450
Is it out of a perfect score of 100 points?

499
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,660
150.

500
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,650
You can question my aesthetics,

501
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,050
but you can't

502
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,980
insult my IQ.

503
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,280
I will never

504
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,640
be with

505
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,770
such a stupid woman.

506
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,180
Never. Ever.

507
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,990
You don't have to like her,

508
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,900
but you can't insult her.

509
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,500
How did I insult her?

510
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,850
69 points.

511
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,510
Isn't she stupid?

512
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,870
It's okay.

513
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,060
It's okay.

514
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:01,750
Apologize.

515
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,450
I didn't do anything wrong.

516
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,050
I was just stating the truth.

517
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,650
It's a misunderstanding.

518
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,250
It's a misunderstanding.

519
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,330
Hao Liang

520
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,700
doesn't feel anything.

521
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,870
Apologize.

522
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,390
I won't.

523
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,940
Mathematics is a test of intelligence.

524
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,180
She couldn't learn it on her own,

525
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,790
and even if I taught her, she still couldn't understand.

526
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,900
As long as any of you can teach her,

527
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,710
I will not only apologize

528
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,710
but also livestream eating a mouse.

529
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,840
Come on, Liang.

530
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,010
When tackling a problem,

531
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,260
should our initial step be to figure out

532
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,060
what the question is assessing?

533
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,730
Let's start from the simplest

534
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,390
direction.

535
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,470
To find out this question's...

536
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,570
main focus.

537
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,800
Let me help you analyze the question.

538
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,220
Okay?

539
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,820
In a bag,

540
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,340
there is one red, one black,

541
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,510
and one white ball.

542
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,980
You can randomly pick one ball at a time,

543
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,690
and after picking, put it back.

544
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,050
Well.

545
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,060
-Hao Liang’s so stupid.
-You will pick three times.

546
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,940
I said it.

547
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,190
Calculate the probability of having no black ball or no red ball

548
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,050
in the bag.

549
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,580
After analyzing this question,

550
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,920
how many important points

551
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,940
have we found?

552
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,010
Here.

553
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,300
Every time we pick one randomly.

554
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,180
That's right.

555
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,150
The second point.

556
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,420
Three times in a row.

557
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,100
That's right. You're smart.

558
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,040
The last point.

559
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,160
I won't give you any hint.

560
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,690
You figure it out yourself.

561
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,100
Hao Liang.

562
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,800
Listen carefully, okay?

563
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,300
This is an independent case.

564
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,370
You know that, right?

565
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,170
An independent case.

566
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,700
An independent case is that

567
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,730
this...

568
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,090
If you go now, you're not helping her,

569
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,020
but hurting her.

570
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,260
It's separate, so...

571
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,100
What is the probability

572
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,560
of not picking a black ball

573
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,140
for the third time in a row?

574
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,040
Dismiss.

575
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,140
You should change your name to Hao Stupid.

576
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,280
I can't do anything about it.

577
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,770
I said she was not capable.

578
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,030
I'm afraid she'll infect me, you know?

579
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,790
Listen.

580
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,180
She's so stupid.

581
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:09,940
Mr. Gu.

582
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,260
I need to export the materials.

583
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:13,880
Wait.

584
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Is this the correct answer?

585
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,260
Before you,

586
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,100
Shi Fei and I interviewed

587
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,940
37 people.

588
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,960
Everyone

589
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,140
graduated from a 985 university.

590
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,860
So,

591
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,980
whether you can answer this question

592
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,270
is not important to me.

593
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,330
What matters is that I hired you.

594
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,410
So,

595
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,380
you are

596
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,470
the most suitable person.

597
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,580
Wait.

598
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
I'm sorry.

599
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,060
Why do you always apologize

600
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,690
for what you didn't do wrong?

601
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,600
Thank you.

602
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,030
Address.

603
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,400
No, thanks.

604
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,050
I'm going to my aunt's house. It's close.

605
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,490
I can take the bus.

606
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,490
Get in.

607
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,650
I'm sorry.

608
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,820
Why do you always

609
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,580
act so stupid

610
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,320
in front of him?

611
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,610
You said something wrong and did something wrong.

612
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,990
You even exposed the worst side

613
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,430
in front of him.

614
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:38,890
Red light.

615
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,040
There's no surveillance

616
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,060
or pedestrians.

617
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,380
Can we go?

618
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,350
Pause on red, and proceed on green.

619
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,710
This is the rule.

620
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,250
When you first joined the company,

621
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:56,960
C lied to you

622
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,240
that I like spicy food.

623
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,830
Why didn't you expose him?

624
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,070
He meant no harm.

625
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,900
Many people know right and wrong.

626
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,230
But few people can persist in doing the right thing.

627
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,630
And you're one of the few.

628
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,130
Is he praising me?

629
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,140
Aunt Yibai.

630
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,570
Is there anything delicious?

631
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,380
I'm hungry.

632
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,340
Get the chopsticks.

633
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,270
Beef noodles.

634
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,940
Is it good?

635
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,810
It's hot.

636
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,610
Are you in a good mood?

637
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,280
Life gives me pressure,

638
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,940
but I create miracles in life.

639
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,570
What did that gentleman

640
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,090
do to you?

641
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,930
He told me about

642
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,130
many of my strengths.

643
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,130
I didn't know many of them.

644
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,380
You're not mad at him anymore?

645
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,240
There were a lot of misunderstandings.

646
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,830
It's not entirely his fault.

647
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,980
Anyway, the matter between Gu Jiuli and Dai

648
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,690
is over.

649
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,810
So,

650
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,050
when will the story between Gu Jiuli and Hao Liang

651
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,700
start?

652
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,160
What are you talking about?

653
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,940
Don't go. Let's talk.

654
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,060
Gu Jiuli.

655
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,220
Are you watching TV?

656
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,570
Well, I'm watching the news.

657
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,840
[Empresses in the Palace]

658
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,670
Incorporate techniques with innovative methods.

659
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,530
Nice.

660
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,030
It's your style.

661
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,760
Mr. Gu.

662
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,010
Everyone, stop.

663
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,580
Let me introduce a new partner.

664
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,410
Han Yijie.

665
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,950
He is responsible for engine optimization.

666
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,910
He graduated from the software engineering major of Tsinghua University.

667
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,570
He finished his master's and Ph.D. in Stanford.

668
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,090
Welcome.

669
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,760
Welcome to join us.

670
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,800
I'm Master Ka.

671
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,160
Hello.

672
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm Yuan.

673
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,500
I majored in mechanical engineering.

674
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,830
Call me if you need help.

675
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:20,920
So cute.

676
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,200
Here. I'm Big Mouth.

677
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,820
Ms. Hu.

678
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,760
Complete the onboarding process for him.

679
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,150
Okay.

680
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:28,770
Thank you.

681
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,130
Hello.

682
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,210
I'm Hao Liang.

683
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,690
Nice to meet you.

684
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,210
Long time no see, Mr. Han.

685
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,760
Nonsense again.

686
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,350
I didn't expect Mr. Gu

687
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,010
to hire you.

688
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,420
Fei.

689
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,790
You don't

690
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,880
think I'm capable?

691
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,590
No.

692
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,680
I didn't mean that.

693
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,930
You think I am a former programmer

694
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,650
who has been engaged in

695
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,600
NGOs

696
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,530
for years.

697
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,410
You doubt

698
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,620
whether I can help Xiaojiu turn the tables.

699
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,930
I didn't mean that.

700
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,750
We haven't seen each other for years.

701
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,970
And you are still so honest.

702
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,450
Alright, stop it.

703
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,760
Is that girl

704
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,300
from the R&D Department?

705
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,330
Why did the R&D Department recruit girls?

706
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,670
This is not Gu's style.

707
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,610
Hao Liang?

708
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,179
Yes.

709
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,659
You think so too?

710
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,960
There's gossip.

711
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,300
Let me tell you.

712
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,090
This is very strange.

713
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,780
Let me tell you.

714
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,040
When I was recruiting,

715
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,050
I found that...

716
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,929
I'll hold their hands tightly.

717
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,460
Go away!

718
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,780
Could it be that

719
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,460
this girl's answer

720
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,040
hit your heart?

721
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,139
But Hao Liang is so common.

722
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,389
I don't think she's your type.

723
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,570
She can't be your type.

724
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:58,740
Are you done?

725
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,260
Gu Jiuli,

726
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,140
something's wrong with you lately.

727
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,480
You even watched Empresses in the Palace last night?

728
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,730
What's wrong?

729
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,140
Did you check my record?

730
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,620
No.

731
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,290
The cloud displayed the recommended program

732
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,750
for continuous playback.

733
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,300
I wanted to understand the culture of young people.

734
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,970
That's all.

735
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,700
Really?

736
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,220
Mr. Han.

737
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,450
Call me Jie or Owen.

738
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,320
Choose one.

739
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,290
Jie, the desk is ready.

740
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,330
Thank you.

741
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,770
I'll hold his hands tightly.

742
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,140
You like to watch Empresses in the Palace?

743
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,060
Which three characters

744
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,100
do you like?

745
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,220
I like Zhen Huan, Consort Hua,

746
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,510
and An Xiaoniao.

747
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,510
It's An Lingrong.

748
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,880
Let me ask you.

749
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,580
If the emperor needs to find someone to sleep with

750
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,580
for three nights,

751
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,730
what is the probability

752
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,280
that he will sleep with

753
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,840
An Lingrong and Zhen Huan

754
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,250
on the first night?

755
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,510
Two-thirds.

756
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,610
What is the probability

757
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,870
that he didn't sleep with her on the second

758
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
and third nights?

759
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,800
Still two-thirds.

760
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,290
What is the sum of the probabilities

761
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,660
of not sleeping with Consort Hua

762
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,570
for three consecutive days?

763
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,020
8/27.

764
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,110
Did I get it right?

765
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,160
Was I right?

766
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,500
Let's continue.

767
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,390
If the emperor treats

768
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,180
every concubine

769
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,330
equally,

770
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,100
every night, the arrangement

771
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,210
is the same,

772
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,350
then this is an independent case.

773
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,380
So the probability is the same.

774
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,170
That's right.

775
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,210
The probability of not sleeping with Zhen Huan

776
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,510
for three consecutive nights

777
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,360
is also 8/27.

778
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,750
Now tell me the sum of probabilities.

779
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,480
Twice the fraction of 8/27.

780
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,220
16/27.

781
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:48,460
Right.

782
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,330
I got it right.

783
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,720
So the answer to this question is

784
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,900
16/27.

785
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,460
Good job, Hao Liang.

786
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,270
You've improved a lot.

787
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,020
C.

788
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,820
What?

789
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,880
I remember someone called C said

790
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,990
he would livestream eating a mouse.

791
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:16,980
Really? Really?

792
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,840
When did I say

793
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,930
I would eat a mouse?

794
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,100
Our company

795
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,210
has 360-degree monitoring

796
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,410
without blind spots,

797
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,910
and the videos are not erased for 90 days.

798
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,900
Do you want to watch the replay?

799
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,610
It's just one question.

800
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,520
Maybe

801
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,690
she was lucky.

802
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,060
What if Hao Liang

803
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,310
can get more than 100 points in the make-up exam?

804
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,880
Then I'll be a follower

805
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,740
of Hao Liang

806
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,640
and call her Master.

807
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,060
Okay.

808
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,870
Remember your promise.

809
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,620
He's indeed Mr. Gu.

810
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,490
He can even taught Hao Liang.

811
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,140
Congratulations. You've become smarter.

812
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,320
Come on.

813
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,090
Where should we move? Over there?

814
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,450
Yes, put it back.

815
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,140
Move it properly.

816
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,850
Can you use some strength?

817
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,450
Poor girl.

818
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,120
Don't you get it?

819
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,950
Mr. Gu is going to

820
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,410
tutor you alone.

821
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,740
Special treatment.
