[Episode 7]

4
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,700
Oh no.

5
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,220
I really want to go to the toilet.

6
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,030
But...

7
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,150
it would be so awkward

8
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,680
if I go to the toilet in my boss's house.

9
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,480
Isn't it funny?

10
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,950
But I really want to go to the toilet now.

11
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,520
I really can't laugh.

12
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,660
Where is the bathroom?

13
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,730
I... I want to go to the toilet.

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,090
It's at the end of the corridor.

15
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,110
Hello, Dan.

16
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,450
Go downstairs of K11

17
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,430
to buy me a double-layered steamed milk pudding later, okay?

18
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,510
Not today.

19
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,240
I... am...

20
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,750
Hello?

21
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,390
Hello?

22
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,850
Hello? Is the signal not good?

23
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,900
Panpan,

24
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,110
if a man lives alone,

25
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,190
but there are a lot of skin care products

26
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,850
in his guest bathroom,

27
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,210
it means...

28
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,840
It means he doesn't live alone.

29
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,520
He has a girlfriend

30
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
living with him.

31
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,760
What's going on?

32
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,390
N-Nothing.

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,440
I can't buy you

34
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,590
a double-layered steamed milk pudding today.

35
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,650
I'll go live in my aunt's house today.

♫Memories gradually found their destination♫

37
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,520
♫They fell on the bottom of my heart and solidified gradually♫

38
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,340
♫Just like that♫

39
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,260
♫They stopped in the lost story♫

40
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,900
♫Who are you waiting for to understand it?♫

41
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,770
♫Just find the map for the answer♫

42
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,980
♫With those gifts from destiny♫

43
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,090
♫I'm imagining the scene of describing the fairy tale to you♫

44
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,390
♫But the reality is full of thoughts♫

45
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,170
♫It was a both complicated and simple♫

46
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,190
♫Conversation♫

47
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,880
♫How should I answer the question?♫

48
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,110
So

49
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,220
you don't have feelings for me.

50
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,980
Everyone misunderstood.

51
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,340
Right?

52
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,960
Something is wrong with the door lock.

53
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,420
Gu, you've changed the password?

54
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:42,630
I talked back

55
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,820
to you.

56
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,250
But is this necessary?

57
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,640
Now you won't let me live here.

58
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,630
Jie lives in Mr. Gu's house.

59
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,260
Could it be...

60
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,270
Something is wrong with the door lock.

61
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,510
You can't get in for the time being.

62
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,510
Really?

63
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,440
The lock went wrong when I came back.

64
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,770
It's too coincidental.

65
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,400
Are you... hiding a beauty in the house?

66
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,270
I asked someone to come to repair it just now.

67
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,470
Come back in an hour.

68
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,150
An hour?

69
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,400
Is it enough?

70
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,190
If you keep talking nonsense,

71
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,230
I'll throw your luggage

72
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,160
from the window.

73
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,350
Fine.

74
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,870
I'll give you... two hours.

75
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,310
No, no.

76
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,210
I won't come back tonight.

77
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,650
Enjoy yourself, Mr. Gu.

78
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,870
Han Yijie has a big mouth.

79
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,480
It will be troublesome if he knows.

80
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,120
Jie lives here?

81
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,040
Why... are you laughing?

82
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,310
Right, well,

83
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,310
when will the serviceman come?

84
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,710
It'll take a while.

85
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,670
Why don't you go enjoy some more TV time?

86
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,350
Gu,

87
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,290
for your happiness in the future,

88
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,890
I will have to sleep

89
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,320
on the street today.

90
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,150
Actually...

91
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,270
I bought the peanut brittle.

92
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,300
I didn't make it.

93
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,550
I know.

94
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,400
Are you...

95
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,550
hungry?

96
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,090
What do you want to eat?

97
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,600
You know how to cook?

98
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,030
Order.

99
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,440
My mom said eating an egg every day

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,730
can ensure sufficient nutrition.

101
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,530
Then... steamed eggs?

102
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,100
Just wait.

103
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,490
This tastes exactly the same

104
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,090
as what I ate in the Japanese restaurant.

105
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,900
Mr. Gu, you're amazing.

106
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,870
Eat this too.

107
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,370
Aren't you hungry?

108
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,520
Hello?

109
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,350
Yes.

110
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,910
Hey, you still remember, right?

111
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,520
Tonight,

112
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,030
we have a competition with Cute Mengmeng online.

113
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,150
Y-Yes.

114
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,070
Where are you?

115
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,070
I... I'm outside.

116
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,000
When will you come back?

117
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,640
Well... the serviceman said

118
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,400
his car was scratched halfway.

119
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,830
He can't make it here in a short time.

120
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,290
Then what should we do?

121
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,120
He said another serviceman

122
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,110
in Chongming

123
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,200
can't come either.

124
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,680
How about tomorrow?

125
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,670
Does he mean...

126
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,120
he wants me to spend the night with him?

127
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,710
Gosh.

128
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,620
Have I used up all my luck

129
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,880
in the next life?

130
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,390
Is it convenient for me

131
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,590
to live here?

132
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,910
It's fine if you don't mind.

133
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,930
Okay.

134
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,870
Thank you.

135
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,360
Okay, I... I got it.

136
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,330
That's it, bye.

137
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,730
It's... still early.

138
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,050
What should we do to kill time?

139
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,390
By the way,

140
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,440
your parents

141
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,710
have come back, right?

142
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,280
Yes.

143
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,270
They are still adjusting to the jet lag.

144
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,430
Then wait a few days.

145
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,410
Let's have a meal together

146
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,340
in a few days.

147
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,120
Have you arranged a place for them to stay?

148
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,540
Of course.

149
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,760
That's good.

150
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,070
I bought your mom a scarf.

151
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,630
She likes purple, right?

152
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,150
I bought her a purple one.

153
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,310
I think she'll like it.

154
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,990
I'm still picking a gift for your father.

155
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,350
I'm gonna take a look now.

156
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,090
Yibai.

157
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,180
I...

158
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,670
What's wrong?

159
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,490
Just say what you want to say.

160
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,550
That agent again?

161
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,910
Yes.

162
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,390
Call him back.

163
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,170
I'll talk to him,

164
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,550
so that he won't keep calling you.

165
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,400
He's just an agent.

166
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,520
Just ignore him.

167
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,020
This... This...

168
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,560
Did a tire burst?

169
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,310
Pull over.

170
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,430
I'm gonna call the insurance company.

171
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,790
No need for that.

172
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,220
It's going to rain soon.

173
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,750
If we wait for them,

174
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,740
it's gonna take a long time.

175
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,440
I can do this.

176
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,500
It won't take long.

177
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,710
Look, you're hurt.

178
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,810
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

179
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,150
I said we should call the insurance company,

180
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,280
but you insisted on doing it yourself.

181
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,440
It won't take long.

182
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,230
I'm almost done.

183
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,350
But I'm a man,

184
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,100
and I'm just

185
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,730
standing... standing here.

186
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,740
You are a woman, and you are working.

187
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,140
Do you think it's proper?

188
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,390
Zhao Dazuo,

189
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,690
what's wrong with you?

190
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,670
It's just a small problem.

191
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,360
Why do we have to wait for the insurance company?

192
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,240
Besides, I didn't ask you to do it.

193
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,260
I'm doing it myself.

194
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,750
And it's done now.

195
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,150
Have you ever considered

196
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,350
my feelings?

197
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,110
You want to do everything, right?

198
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,620
You want to do my things

199
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,230
and my family's things.

200
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,350
Then what am I?

201
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,820
I'm a man.

202
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,310
I'm useless in your eyes,

203
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,830
right?

204
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,550
What do you mean?

205
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,520
What do you think I mean?

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,180
I can't stand you anymore.

207
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,240
That's what I mean.

208
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,550
You have another woman?

209
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,550
You want to break up, right?

210
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:36,950
Yes.

211
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,990
I have another woman.

212
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,350
I want to break up.

213
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:40,950
Okay?

214
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:43,670
Sure.

215
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,270
Get lost.

216
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,190
Fine.

235

The online competition is at 9 p.m.

236
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,190
It's 8:45 p.m. now.

237
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,370
Where should I present the live streaming show?

238
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,830
Your... phone ringtone

239
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,710
is quite special.

240
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,830
That's a song of my idols.

241
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,380
The reverberation in the bathroom is good.

242
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,620
It should be a suitable place for singing.

243
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,780
But... what should I tell him?

244
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,780
Mr. Gu, I want to take a shower?

245
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,480
No, no.

246
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,150
It's so awkward.

247
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,320
What should I do?

248
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,340
It's already 8:50 p.m.

249
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,590
Are they popular?

250
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,720
Well, is this one...

251
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,780
a member of the Running Man program?

252
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,300
Of course not.

253
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,600
That's Song Yiren.

254
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,970
This is Li Jiajie.

255
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,990
Has his cross-race effect

256
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
surfaced again?

257
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:04,870
Mr. Gu,

258
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,350
it's late.

259
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,700
I want to wash up.

260
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,580
This early?

261
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,590
I'm used to washing up at this hour.

262
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,190
In the bathroom,

263
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,150
there are new personal hygiene products

264
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,480
and disposable towels.

265
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,860
Why did she take her bag with her?

266
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,210
Thank God.

267
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,470
I can still make it.

268
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:34,480
No.

269
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,870
What if he hears me

270
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,710
when we have a competition later?

271
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,510
Then my secret will be revealed.

272
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,380
Come on.

273
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,880
The hair dryer is so technologically advanced.

274
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,920
It's quiet.

275
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,730
It's almost time.

276
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,650
Whatever.

277
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,579
Good evening, Dai.

278
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,460
Aren't you gonna show yourself today?

279
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,390
It's not my live streaming day tonight.

280
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,089
Will it do if I just

281
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,839
sing a song?

282
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,140
Okay, let's start now.

283
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,590
W-What's wrong?

284
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,350
You didn't bring spare clothes.

285
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,350
I found a new set for you

286
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,200
and I'm putting it at the doorway.

287
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Okay, thank you, Mr. Gu.

288
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,330
Dai.

289
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,960
Dai, are you still there?

290
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,750
Yes.

291
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,190
Maybe

292
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,670
the signal here is not very good.

293
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,310
Let's start now.

294
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,000
For the sake of fairness,

295
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,940
you can tell us

296
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,850
what song you want to listen to through the bullet-screen comments.

297
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,290
Okay.

298
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,750
What do you think of this song?

299
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm fine with it. Let's do it.

300
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,150
Okay, I'll sing first.

Love you.

307
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,400
It's your turn, Dai.

308
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,550
Get started.

309
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,020

Dai is awesome.

314
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,680
Dai is beautiful and cool.

315
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,390
It's not the chorus yet.

316
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,060
She started with a high pitch.

317
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,100
I'm afraid she'll run out of energy later.

Hao Liang, are you alright?

330
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,770
Is there a problem?

331
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,150
N-Nothing.

332
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,360
What's going on?

333
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,430
She can't reach the high pitch at all.

334
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,760
There is no doubt she will lose.

335
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,890
Take care, Dai.

336
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,030
What happened?

337
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,320
Someone said you can't reach the high pitch

338
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,450
through the bullet-screen comments.

339
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,180
I also think so.

340
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,240
Now it seems

341
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,670
Dai will be punished.

342
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,550
Do you have any suggestion?

343
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,830
Smash a huge stone placed on her chest.

344
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,290
Eat grilled cicada pupas.

345
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,280
Here is my suggestion.

346
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,510
Wear swimwear to present a live streaming show.

347
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,070
You guys are so cruel.

348
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,440
I think we should give her

349
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,640
a lesser punishment.

350
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,550
How about

351
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,430
taking a video tour of your house?

352
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,150
No.

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How about removing your makeup now?

354
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,710
There's no makeup remover in my house.

355
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,460
Fine.

356
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,150
Dai is so insincere.

357
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,070
No makeup remover? Liar.

358
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,230
Anyway, not today.

359
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,790
When I present a live streaming show next time,

360
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,520
whatever punishment you want,

361
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,770
I'll satisfy you.

362
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,550
Okay.

363
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,160
Let me... think about it.

364
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,620
What's wrong with you?

365
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,050
You excel at performing that song,

366
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,850
right?

367
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,840
What's wrong with your voice?

368
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,820
Nothing. I'm... busy today.

369
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,450
I'll talk to you later.

370
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,320
Don't hang up.

371
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,350
What on earth happened to you?

372
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,670
Nothing. Really.

373
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,110
Hao Liang, are you talking to me?

374
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,040
N-No.

375
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,990
Why is there a man's voice?

376
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,730
Where are you?

377
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,590
What happened?

378
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,670
Hello?

379
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,820
This...

380
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,910
is too big.

381
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,370
It suits me well.

382
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,460
Mr. Gu, why are your cheeks red?

383
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,740
You have a fever?

384
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,660
I'm fine.

385
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,020
I'm fine.

386
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,810
You're sick. You can't drink cold water.

387
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,080
Give it to me.

388
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,720
Give...

389
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What does he want?

390
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,560
He looks so scary.

391
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,470
I just don't allow him to drink cold water.

392
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,020
Is he going to kill me?

393
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,040
What does he want?

394
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,400
Give it to me.

395
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,940
Han Yijie's bedroom

396
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,720
is a mess.

397
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,710
You...

398
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
You... You sleep in the living room.

399
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,360
He's... so weird tonight.

400
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,000
Yibai.

401
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,780
What happened to you?

402
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,660
Give me your ID card.

403
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,650
I've been locked outside the door.

404
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,510
I don't have anything with me now.

405
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,990
Hello, Ma'am.

406
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,010
-I want a king-sized bedroom.
-Okay.

407
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,130
Sorry, Ma'am.

408
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,370
Currently, we only have

409
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,230
an executive suite available.

410
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,830
Is that okay?

411
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,160
Okay.

412
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,840
Okay, please wait a moment.

413
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,010
How would you like to pay?

414
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,030
Okay, please take this.

415
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,700
This way, please.

416
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,300
Thank you.

417
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,960
What on earth happened to you?

418
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,490
No matter what happened, you can just tell me.

419
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,600
What's wrong with you?

420
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,910
Go upstairs to take a shower first.

421
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,910
Otherwise, you'll get sick easily.

422
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,000
Don't worry.

423
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,980
I'm not interested in you at all

424
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,310
considering how you look now.

425
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,790
I'm just worried if you catch a cold,

426
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,990
everyone will be infected by you at the meeting tomorrow.

427
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,640
Take a shower.

428
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,710
Give it to me.

429
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,150
Let me do it.

430
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,200
Who said

431
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,050
he's not interested in me

432
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,840
just now?

433
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,190
What on earth happened to your hand?

434
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,600
If you don't want to tell me,

435
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,640
I won't ask again.

436
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,930
Done.

437
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,910
Thank you.

438
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,520
I just hope it won't be that bad

439
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,680
because of my company

440
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,940
when you think of today

441
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,340
in the future.

442
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,140
So today,

443
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,830
what on earth happened to you?

444
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,190
I got kicked out

445
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,290
by my landlord cruelly.

446
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,210
In this world, is there actually someone

447
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,610
who can make you give in?

448
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,260
He's not the only one

449
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,710
who can make me give in.

450
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,290
Coming.

451
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,100
Hello.

452
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,560
Mr. Han, here's the set meal you ordered.

453
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:29,990
Okay.

454
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,610
Wait a moment.

455
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,450
Eating something delicious

456
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,580
will make you happy.

457
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,710
Miss, this is the ginger sugar water you asked for.

458
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,380
Please

459
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,030
help wash my friend's clothes.

460
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,560
She needs to wear them tomorrow morning.

461
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:57,940
Okay.

462
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,630
Thank you.

463
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520
Sir, enjoy your meal.

464
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,000
Okay.

465
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,080
Come on.

466
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,180
Be careful.

467
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,170
Eat.

468
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,810
Don't just sit there.

469
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,710
You haven't eaten much

470
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,910
the whole day, right?

471
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,810
Drink the ginger sugar water while it's hot.

472
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,870
Don't catch a cold.

473
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,120
I'm leaving.

474
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,000
Where are you going?

475
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,850
I'm going back to the company.

476
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,590
Let's eat together.

477
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,250
After eating,

478
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,910
you go take a shower.

479
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,910
Yibai,

480
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,650
so you mean...

481
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,350
You sleep on the sofa.

482
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,280
Aren't you worried

483
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,200
I'll knock at your door in the middle of the night and...

484
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,490
I practiced boxing for five years.

485
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,750
You can try if you're not afraid of death.

486
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,230
Okay.

487
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,820
Yibai,

488
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,310
were you...

489
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,060
worried about me just now?

490
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,830
Mr. Gu is still up.

491
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,150
I can't believe

492
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,190
we're sleeping under the same roof.

493
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,390
It's like a dream.

494
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,160
I'm thirsty.

495
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,760
Forget it.

496
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,830
Xiaojiu, turn off the light.

497
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,020
The light is off.

498
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,280
Can you sleep comfortably on the sofa?

499
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,650
Yes.

500
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,490
Good night.

501
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,580
Good night.

502
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,540
Good night, Mr. Gu.

503
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,930
I must wake up before Mr. Gu.

504
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,850
I can't let him see

505
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,230
the stinky me.

506
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,300
You are up. Let's eat.

507
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,230
W-Who am I?

508
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,800
W-Where am I?

509
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,680
It's already 7:30 a.m.

510
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,710
Why didn't my alarm clock go off?

511
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,350
Oh no.

512
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,190
I set the alarm time incorrectly last night.

513
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,550
I'm so stupid.

514
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,610
Mr. Gu hasn't woken up yet.

515
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,750
Thank goodness.

516
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,120
Gosh.

517
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,590
Who is this female ghost?

518
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,670
She has puffy eyes, dark circles, and a puffy face.

519
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,510
No.

520
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,770
I must make myself look better

521
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,050
before he wakes up.

522
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,929
What should I do?

523
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,750
What should I do?

524
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,650
I'm so smart.

525
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,760
What are you doing?

526
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,380
I have a little puffiness.

527
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,130
I was trying to relieve it after getting up.

528
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,310
Just... a little?

529
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,750
The door has been fixed?

530
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,030
You just went out?

531
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,060
At 6 a.m.,

532
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,830
the serviceman came to fix the door.

533
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,900
I went for a run.

534
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,510
Isn't it good to stay in your bed?

535
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,100
Isn't it good to sleep late?

536
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,980
Why did you go for a run so early in the morning?

537
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,780
It's good. It's good for health.

538
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,430
Then I'm... going to take a shower.

539
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,270
Gosh.

540
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,870
He saw me

541
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,970
like this.

542
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,420
Which one is Mr. Gu's?

543
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,580
This is the smell. This is it.

544
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,910
Let's eat.

545
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,910
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

546
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,880
He has smelt it?

547
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,310
He knows

548
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,880
I used his facial cleanser.

549
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,580
This is so embarrassing.

550
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,020
What's wrong?

551
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,010
Is something wrong... with my face?

552
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,560
N-No.

553
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,060
I... I just think

554
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,030
Mr. Gu can be cool and cute.

555
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,140
You can handle all kinds of styles.

556
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,860
T-Thank you.

557
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,270
Mr. Gu,

558
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,320
do you go for a run every day?

559
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,110
Yes.

560
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,670
I would go for a run whenever I have time.

561
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,360
You should've woken me up.

562
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,980
I like exercising too.

563
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,110
I wanted to wake you up,

564
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,590
but...

565
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,420
What?

566
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,080
Forget it.

567
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,900
Go ahead. It's okay.

568
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,960
But you were sleeping

569
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,790
very soundly.

570
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,100
You were drooling,

571
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:58,850
talking in your sleep,

572
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,810
and snoring.

573
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,200
What... What...

574
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,520
What did I say?

575
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,240
Are you sure you want me to tell you?

576
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,420
Did I...

577
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,710
say

578
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,870
I have a crush on you?

579
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,780
You said I abused my employees

580
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,240
and I'm inhumane.

581
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,780
Is my image in your eyes

582
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,890
that bad?

583
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,570
No... No.

584
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,110
Mr. Gu, let me explain.

585
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,090
You're the best boss in the world.

586
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,790
R-Really.
