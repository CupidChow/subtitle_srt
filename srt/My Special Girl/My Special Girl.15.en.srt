[Episode 15]

4
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,479
Guess who sponsored us.

5
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,420
Who?

6
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,360
Just say it.

7
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,910
-Don't keep us guessing.
-Would it be

8
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,790
some alumni

9
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,420
who used to be

10
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,450
members of the Drama Club too?

11
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,170
Come on.

12
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,550
They're all corporate slaves.

13
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,920
How would they be able to afford to sponsor us?

14
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,350
Right.

15
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,400
There's a message attached to the remittance slip.

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,680
"To the only female lead,

17
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,060
Yang Panpan."

18
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,190
Awesome!

19
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,250
How much did they sponsor us?

20
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,810
20,000 yuan.

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,720
20,000 yuan?

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,030
Who is it? Panpan.

23
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,870
Tell us.

24
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,130
Who's the sponsor?

25
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,320
How would I know?

26
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,660
There are so many people pursuing me.

27
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,060
How would I know which one it is?

28
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,720
This one is different.

29
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,070
This one has his mind on you and is rich too.

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,840
Panpan,

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,450
your Mr. Right has appeared.

32
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,050
Yes.

33
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,910
It's only 20,000 yuan and you already consider him rich?

34
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,630
Girls

35
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,380
should have a broader horizon.

36
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,480
Seriously.

37
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,920
Also, tell Zhang to keep a low profile.

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,270
Don't keep giving out my personal information

39
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,250
to other people.

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,930
So annoying.

41
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,010
Got it.

42
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,420
Don't worry.

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,180
All the actors. Go to the theater.

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,230
Hurry up and get the lights checked.

45
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,980
Check the lights.

46
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,540
Hurry up.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,150
Let's go!

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,850
Get moving. Get moving.

49
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,750
All actors, hurry up.

50
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,320
Okay.

51
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,590
Hurry up, all actors.

52
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,300
Watch your step.

53
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,600
Girls, watch your step.

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,500
Hurry up. Line up.

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,100
Good luck!

56
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,950
Panpan.

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
Good luck today.

58
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,740
-We'll wait for you on the stage, okay?
-Okay.

59
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,740
Hurry up.

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,530
Is it a little wrinkled?

61
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,400
Dan, do you have a minute?

62
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,570
Can you help me iron my dress?

63
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,850
It's a little wrinkled.

64
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,340
Sure.

65
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,290
Thank you.

66
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,150
Thank you, Dan.

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,770
Thank you.

68
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,630
We're leaving.

69
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,370
Good luck.

70
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,140
See you later.

71
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,700
I'm Cinderella.

72
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,100
My prince

73
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
is waiting for me in the palace.

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,800
It's okay to put it on for a while, right?

75
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,220
No.

76
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,930
If someone comes in,

77
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,500
it will be embarrassing.

78
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,050
Don't look at me like that.

79
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,970
If you keep looking at me like that,

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,980
I'll wear you.

81
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,450
Are you here for me?

82
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,890
Prince.

83
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,930
I am your Cinderella.

84
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't want to keep hiding

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,200
in the silence of the mottled tree shadows.

86
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,160
I want to stand by your side

87
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,580
above board

88
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,760
and be your princess.

89
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,020
In fact, from the beginning, I…

90
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,430
I don't want to hide

91
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,580
in the silence of the mottled tree shadows.

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,820
I hope one day

93
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,780
I can stand by your side

94
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,430
above board

95
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,460
and be your princess.

96
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,710
In fact, I fell in love with you

97
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,100
a long time ago.

98
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,970
Dream comes true.

99
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,540
Dan, are you done ironing…

100
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,040
Ironing my dress?

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,750
Yes.

102
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
I just want to try it on

103
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,050
and see if it's still wrinkled.

104
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,290
I'll take it off now.

105
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,170
Dan.

106
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,540
We ordered 20 cups of milk tea at Little East Gate.

107
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,430
Go get them.

108
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,900
Okay, I got it.

109
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,990
Mr. Gu,

110
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,230
are you here to see me?

111
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,820
I was rehearsing outside.

112
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,360
I'll wait for you outside.

113
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,550
In the afternoon,

114
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,990
you were sitting at the…

115
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,920
So handsome.

116
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,030
Why did Mr. Gu

117
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,580
suddenly come to our school?

118
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,380
What?

119
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,180
Mr. Gu went to see you directly?

120
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,090
You're done for.

121
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,940
Don't scare me.

122
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,940
Jie has said

123
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,110
that since you rejected Mr. Gu,

124
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,630
he has become perverted.

125
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,260
P-Perverted?

126
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,050
He has a tendency to take revenge on society.

127
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,680
No way.

128
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,550
Then why do you think

129
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,550
Mr. Gu went to your school to see you?

130
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,440
Have you got

131
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,060
your stamped internship certificate?

132
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,070
Let it go if they don't give it to me.

133
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,530
I'll figure it out myself.

134
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,270
Then Mr. Gu must have gone to complain

135
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,310
to your school

136
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,700
that you have no regard for superiors.

137
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,550
As stupid as a pig.

138
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,310
Yes, as stupid as a pig.

139
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,900
So silly.

140
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,650
And so silly.

141
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,780
Alright, alright.

142
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,910
I have to hang up now.

143
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,580
Hao Liang.

144
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,940
I've been looking for you.

145
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,710
You're the only one

146
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,510
who hasn't turned in the internship certificate.

147
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,780
Ms. Zhang,

148
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,330
I'll give it to you later.

149
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,910
You're here.

150
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,910
Let's go.

151
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,330
Go to Little East Gate with me to get the milk tea.

152
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,590
Don't forget about it.

153
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,490
Here, have some milk tea.

154
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,340
There are more here.

155
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,500
Okay, thank you.

156
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,020
Milk tea.

157
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,780
Thank you.

158
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,409
Thank you.

159
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:33,920
Come down.

160
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,050
Come down. Let me fix your hair for you.

161
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,760
This dress…

162
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,210
Do you feel comfortable down there?

163
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,870
Be careful.

164
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,280
Thank you.

165
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,940
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

166
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,560
Mr. Gu gave me a cup exclusively.

167
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,540
He's so nice to you.

168
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:51,990
Yes.

169
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,140
After we got the sponsorship,

170
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,670
Zhang has become generous.

171
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,140
He's even willing to add milk foam in our milk tea.

172
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Of course.

173
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,330
We should thank Panpan.

174
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,760
If it weren't for her,

175
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,620
how would the sponsor

176
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,900
give us the sponsorship?

177
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,070
Thank you, Panpan.

178
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,380
Thank you, Panpan.

179
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,350
You're welcome.

180
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,580
We're all friends.

181
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,380
I heard from Zhang

182
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,810
that the sponsor will come this afternoon.

183
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,490
I think it's the CEO

184
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,160
of a pretty big company

185
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,020
called something like Jiuqian Technology, right?

186
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,940
Just follow the previous plan.

187
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,960
Okay.

188
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,330
I got it.

189
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,500
Mr. Gu.

190
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,180
So it was you

191
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,710
who sponsored our troupe.

192
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,830
He really fell in love with me at first sight.

193
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,140
Yet that day he pretended to

194
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,470
refuse to give me a ride.

195
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,020
So he was playing hard to get.

196
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,020
Hao Liang.

197
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,500
Come here.

198
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,549
Hurry and take a look.

199
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,870
The crystal shoes are broken.

200
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,590
You either

201
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,400
quickly fix it now

202
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,300
or go buy a new pair.

203
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,740
Hurry up and get it done.

204
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,090
Okay?

205
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,180
Hurry up. Hurry up.

206
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,040
Crystal shoes.

207
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,540
Hurry up.

208
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,540
Dear Dan, I'm counting on you.

209
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,610
Your shoe size is the same as mine.

210
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,460
Be sure to buy a better looking pair

211
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,780
of shoes for me.

212
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,430
Besides,

213
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,380
Mr. Gu came here today

214
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,260
to see my play.

215
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,260
I'm the female lead.

216
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,560
I can't be absent, right?

217
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,480
So, please.

218
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,340
Hurry up.

219
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:04,930
Okay.

220
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,880
Thank you, Dan.

221
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,780
Don't worry.

222
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,930
I'll drive you there.

223
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,290
No need, Mr. Gu.

224
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,850
She will take the subway, which is quite fast.

225
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,370
Mr. Gu is like this.

226
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,420
For my affairs,

227
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,060
he certainly does them himself.

228
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,500
Right?

229
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,860
That's right.

230
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,540
Yes.

231
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,460
Right.

232
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,170
I finally saw a tall, rich, and handsome man

233
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,430
with my own eyes today.

234
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,020
I also think he's great.

235
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Sorry to trouble you.

236
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,310
And thank you for driving me to buy shoes.

237
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,180
No need to be so polite to me.

238
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,380
After I went back that day,

239
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,850
I was in a low mood.

240
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,480
The team building.

241
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,340
Why is Mr. Gu bringing up the past again?

242
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,900
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,020
But

244
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,660
after I went home, I found…

245
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,460
T-Turn right.

246
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,840
T-The small goods market.

247
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,150
Where are you going?

248
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:06,950
Hello.

249
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,980
The shoes over here

250
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,380
are all featured designs of our designers.

251
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,840
Which pair do you like?

252
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,500
You can try it on.

253
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,490
It's too expensive.

254
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,830
We only have a budget of 200 yuan.

255
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,240
I'll pay for it.

256
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,580
There's a message attached to the remittance slip.

257
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,030
"To the only female lead,

258
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,420
Yang Panpan."

259
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,330
So,

260
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,580
Mr. Gu is so willing to spend money

261
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,340
because of Yang Panpan?

262
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,000
His turnaround

263
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,930
is rather too fast, isn't it?

264
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,380
Lady.

265
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,630
This is our designer's

266
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,340
featured design.

267
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,800
Would you like to try it on?

268
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,980
I'll try it on for Panpan then.

269
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
What's your size?

270
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,150
Thirty-six.

271
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,150
Okay. Please wait for a moment.

272
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,690
Miss, your skin is so fair.

273
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,260
This pair of shoes

274
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,100
sets off your temperament very well.

275
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,360
Sir, what do you think?

276
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,650
We want two pairs.

277
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,580
No password.

278
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,600
I don't want it.

279
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,100
Two pairs of the same shoes?

280
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,530
Yes.

281
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
Okay. Just a moment, please.

282
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,140
I'll pack them up for you.

283
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,530
I said I don't want it.

284
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
You don't like it?

285
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,830
I like it.

286
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
That's good then.

287
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,900
No, this pair of shoes is too expensive.

288
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,580
I have money.

289
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,420
And you like it.

290
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,980
And I want to give it to you.

291
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,040
Is there a problem?

292
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,910
Aren't you afraid that Panpan will get angry?

293
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,860
"To the only female lead,

294
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,660
Yang Panpan."

295
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,610
That was what you wrote

296
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,690
on the sponsorship remittance slip.

297
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,860
I've never written

298
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,990
such boring words.

299
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,280
Are you being jealous?

300
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,740
No, I'm not.

301
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,780
Hao Liang.

302
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,660
Born on January 1, 2000.

303
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,940
160 cm in height.

304
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,070
The weight

305
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,100
hovers between 40 kg and 45 kg throughout the year.

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,780
A graduating senior

307
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,600
from the Department of Preschool Education at Hudu University.

308
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,940
A marginal member of the Drama Club.

309
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,140
The weakest debater in the Debate Club.

310
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,960
Likes spicy food.

311
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,920
Favorite food is Hot Chicken Flavor Ramen.

312
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,520
Likes singer-songwriters.

313
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,660
Favorite actor is Zhang Yunlong.

314
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,210
Likes cats and is afraid of dogs.

315
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,090
Tried to run at night

316
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,760
but gave up soon.

317
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,580
Last night,

318
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,740
I read over all the posts in your Moments

319
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,440
from the past five years.

320
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,060
W-Why?

321
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,810
You tell me why.

322
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,810
I…

323
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,460
I…

324
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,680
From beginning to end,

325
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm here to pursue you.

326
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,430
I sponsored the Drama Club because of you.

327
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,320
I came out to buy shoes because of you too.

328
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,390
But…

329
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,540
B-But that day,

330
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,480
I made it clear, didn't I?

331
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,330
Your family

332
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,990
doesn't approve of you being in a relationship.

333
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,250
Do you still remember

334
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,090
what you asked me

335
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,220
when you sent me home

336
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,210
on the day that I was drunk?

337
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,020
Of course I remember.

338
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,250
The problem is you probably don't.

339
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,400
You said you like me.

340
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,290
Now,

341
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,380
let me tell you my answer.

342
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,340
Hao Liang.

343
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,210
I like you too.

344
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,950
It's okay if your family doesn't approve.

345
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,150
I can wait.

346
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,860
I have enough patience.

347
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,230
You already knew all about it?

348
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,250
I never thought I…

349
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,130
I would be foolish sometimes.

350
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,910
If I had realized it earlier,

351
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:41,610
we wouldn't have to

352
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,870
take a roundabout way.

353
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,060
But…

354
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,180
There's no "but."

355
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,660
I'm so awful.

356
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,790
Thirty-six points for your score?

357
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
A negative score.

358
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,940
I have a negative score in love relationships.

359
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,570
Are you willing to accommodate me?

360
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,730
♫That kid is afraid of love♫

383
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,620
Mr. Gu paid for it.

384
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,150
So beautiful.

385
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,260
These are the most famous crystal shoes.

386
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,220
The well-known Dream Wedding Shoes.

387
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,540
That's because Mr. Gu

388
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,370
is so sweet and kind to Panpan.

389
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,120
Right.

390
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,190
Don't say that.

391
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,950
Mr. Gu is just nice and attentive.

392
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,270
If any other girl played the role,

393
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,690
he would have treated her so well too.

394
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,330
Right, Mr. Gu?

395
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,330
Not necessarily.

396
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,580
Hao Liang.

397
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,230
I'll wait for you outside.

398
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,060
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

399
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,940
Thank you.

400
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,390
You want to keep a low profile.

401
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,480
I'll totally cooperate with you.

402
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,360
Lucky you.

403
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,170
It looks so nice.

404
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,510
Alright, stop talking.

405
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,860
The show will start soon.

406
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,830
Get ready.

407
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,650
Get ready.

408
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,120
Hurry up.

409
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,850
Hao Liang. Hao Liang.

410
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,130
Why did Mr. Gu give me

411
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,430
such expensive shoes?

412
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,850
Originally, I was going to

413
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,650
buy them at the small goods market.

414
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,900
He insisted on going to the big mall.

415
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,830
And then?

416
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,840
Then…

417
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,900
He confessed his love to me.

418
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,050
Then I told him it was too expensive.

419
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,020
Too expensive.

420
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,150
What did he say then?

421
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,390
He said he's rich. He doesn't care.

422
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,540
He's rich. He doesn't care.

423
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,240
Y-You two…

424
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,460
The prince gives crystal shoes to Cinderella.

425
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,540
And today I'm Cinderella.

426
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,730
I know what he means.

427
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,490
Panpan, he actually…

428
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:53,930
I know

429
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,220
Mr. Gu is a low-profile person.

430
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,220
There were so many people just now

431
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,400
that it wasn't convenient for me to express myself.

432
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,270
Tell him on my behalf later.

433
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,690
Let him treat everyone to dinner

434
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,270
after the show.

435
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,730
It's okay.

436
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,270
Don't be shy.

437
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,330
That's what I said.

438
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,150
Just relay the exact words to him.

439
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,510
OK?

440
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,770
But…

441
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,660
Don't be shy.

442
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,100
Alright. Attention, everyone.

443
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,890
Attention, everyone.

444
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,840
The show will begin soon.

445
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,690
Come on.

446
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,120
Everyone, go backstage and get ready.

447
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
I'm going to get busy now.

448
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,040
Remember to relay the words for me.

449
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,100
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

450
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,560
Hurry. Help me up.

451
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,330
Be careful.

452
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,290
Well…

453
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,140
Hao Liang.

454
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,600
Go to the backstage area now

455
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,550
and check all the props for me

456
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,410
one more time, okay?

457
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,490
Hurry up.

458
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,300
The show is about to start.

459
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,390
Why don't you go in?

460
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,090
I'm waiting for you.

461
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,650
Panpan asked you to treat everyone to a meal

462
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,130
after the show.

463
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,740
We always have dinner together

464
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,620
after the show.

465
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,280
I'll go too.

466
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,340
I don't have time.

467
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,850
Because

468
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,730
I want to have dinner with my girlfriend.

469
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,250
Watch your step when you're walking.

470
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,580
What are you looking at?

471
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,540
Ice cream shop.

472
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,380
You just finished eating something hot and you want to eat something cool.

473
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,700
Don't you care about your health?

474
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,230
I won't have a stomachache.

475
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,470
Let's go.

476
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,040
Mr. Gu, do you want some?

477
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,390
What did you call me?

478
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,240
M-Mr. Gu.

479
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,490
Change how you address me.

480
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,950
Boss.

481
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,880
Another one.

482
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,160
If you get it wrong again,

483
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,290
I'll punish you.

484
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,270
B-Boss Gu.

485
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,580
H-How are you going to punish me?

486
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,040
Uncle.

487
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,780
Hello.

488
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,190
Hello, what do you like?

489
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,250
Please take a look.

490
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,760
What a great variety of scrapbook journals here!

491
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,030
Yes.

492
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,730
These are all our new designs.

493
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,570
Excuse me.

494
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,730
Do you still

495
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,640
have the Peanuts comic series

496
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,610
here?

497
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,060
I think so.

498
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,900
Please wait here.

499
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,100
I'll help you find it.

500
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,670
Thank you.

501
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,320
You're welcome.

502
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Let me have a look.

503
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,290
No.

504
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,690
You can't look at it.

505
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,820
You can't look at it.

506
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,730
Who is it you're writing about?

507
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,180
What about the Tang Monk's attribute?

508
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,070
T-That means

509
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,320
you make others drool over you

510
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,920
and it's easy to "bully" you.

511
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,220
What does "Jiang Zhishu of the City of Magic" mean?

512
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,630
Well…

513
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,430
T-That means you're so smart

514
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,220
and helped me with my study

515
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,390
so that I could pass the make-up exam.

516
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,780
But

517
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,720
it has been a while

518
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,600
since I tutored you in Higher Mathematics.

519
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,050
Just stop looking at it.

520
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,740
When did you

521
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,690
start to like me?

522
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,010
I'll continue reading if you don't tell me.

523
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,840
No, no, no.

524
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,300
I… I've liked you

525
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,990
since the first time I saw you.

526
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,540
What?

527
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,020
I didn't hear you.

528
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,840
Louder.

529
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,070
Miss.

530
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,640
The whole series you want is here.

531
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,460
Please take a look.

532
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,660
Which one do you want?

533
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,810
All of them.

534
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,250
Okay. I'll pack them up for you.

535
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,780
So many?

536
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,500
Then

537
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,060
when will I be able to finish writing on all of them?

538
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,460
We still have a lot of time

539
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,590
to get to know each other

540
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,720
and to write on them.

541
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,110
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

542
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,640
Bye-bye.

543
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,660
I'll say goodbye here.

544
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,900
You'll say goodbye here.

545
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,740
I'm going upstairs.

546
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,440
Do you like this doll we bought?

547
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,670
Yes, I like it very much.

548
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,930
Thank you, Babe.

549
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,030
You're welcome.

550
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,550
Should we do that…

551
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,520
Hao Liang.

552
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,980
Hello, Ms. Chen.

553
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,530
You went to buy supper?

554
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,130
Hao Liang.

555
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,740
You

556
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,330
did so well on the exam this time.

557
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,840
Your grade has suddenly jumped

558
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,650
from 69 to 101.

559
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,990
Since I started teaching,

560
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,230
you're the first one

561
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,300
who has made such great progress.

562
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm so surprised.

563
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,280
Next time, go to my class

564
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,750
and pass on your wisdom

565
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,420
to the underclassmen.

566
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,500
Tell them

567
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,430
how to work miracles

568
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,070
through

569
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,490
their own effort.

570
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,750
You are…

571
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,400
No, no, no.

572
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,090
Ms. Chen, no…

573
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,980
You…

574
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,090
Hao Liang's uncle.

575
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,100
I remember you.

576
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,340
It seems

577
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,460
Hao Liang's great improvement

578
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,140
in her grade recently

579
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,770
is due to

580
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,790
the great support

581
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,800
of parents and guardians like you.

582
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,780
Hao Liang.

583
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,640
Come on.

584
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,700
Keep it up.

585
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,240
Okay, Ms. Chen.

586
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,910
Well, Uncle.

587
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,990
I'm going upstairs now.

588
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,280
My teacher is here.

589
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,160
Ms. Chen, bye-bye.

590
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,190
Have a good rest.

591
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,950
Uncle.

592
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,860
Wait a minute.

593
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,810
Hao Liang promised

594
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,850
to go to my class next time

595
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,050
and pass on her wisdom

596
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,970
to my students.

597
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,340
You must come then.

598
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,060
You

599
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
need to talk to the kids

600
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,330
from an elder's perspective

601
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,050
about

602
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,770
how to improve their grades

603
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,660
and keep them up.

604
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,260
We'll see.

605
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,190
I'll wait for you, Uncle.

606
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,990
You must come.

607
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,100
Dan.

608
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,880
Why didn't you

609
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,860
keep Mr. Gu there for me?

610
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,570
I was waiting backstage for a long time.

611
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,500
Where did you go?

612
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,750
What a bummer!

613
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:40,990
Panpan.

614
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,450
Really!

615
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,630
Well, I don't blame you.

616
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,160
Next time, I'll ask him out on my own initiative.

617
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,930
Actually…

618
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,170
Actually, Mr. Gu and I

619
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,630
are in a relationship now.

620
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,220
Alright.

621
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,570
You're not angry?

622
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,820
It's poor that you've never been in a love relationship.

623
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,060
If imagination

624
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,930
can make you

625
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,560
taste the sweetness of love,

626
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,800
then I support you.

627
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,820
Always imagine.

628
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,510
Being happy is above all else.

629
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,990
Come on!

630
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,770
Come on!

631
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,910
Panpan.

632
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,460
Alright.

633
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,020
This is the last class meeting

634
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,260
you all will be attending.

635
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,300
Wish you all the best

636
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,140
and a bright future

637
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,830
after graduation.

638
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,360
[Graduation Season]

639
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,170
Let's give ourselves applause

640
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,590
and cheer for ourselves.

641
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,470
Now,

642
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,530
please take a look

643
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,960
at the form in your hands

644
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,220
and check it.

645
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,390
Are you busy?

646
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,180
No, I'm not.

647
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,830
Otherwise, you won't be able to graduate.

648
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,810
Do you have any plans tomorrow?

649
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,240
If not, let's go on a date.

650
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,910
Hao Liang.

651
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,650
Is there a mistake in your credit calculation?

652
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,890
No, no.

653
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,570
I don't have any plans.

654
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,490
I can go out.

655
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,280
Looking forward to the first date

656
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,760
with my boyfriend.

657
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,800
But

658
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,870
what should I wear?

659
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,250
How young I am!

660
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,550
Why did she call me uncle?

661
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,570
This is fun.

662
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,230
It can measure your age based on your skin type.

663
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,380
My skin condition is only that of a 17-year-old.

664
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,780
For me, it's 20 years old.

665
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,580
How boring!

666
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,580
It's indeed a trashy app.

667
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,610
I guess

668
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,980
girls like this kind of app better.

669
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,020
Hao Liang. Ms. Hu.

670
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,940
What's the age that each of you get?

671
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,100
Hao Liang, come on.

672
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,490
What's yours?

673
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,700
Seventeen years old.

674
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,330
Do I really

675
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,160
look that childish?

676
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,920
He has a successful career.

677
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,610
Do I really look out of place

678
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,790
when I stand by his side?

679
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,780
Dan,

680
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,540
you should change your style.

681
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,210
This app isn't accurate in its measurement.

682
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,190
Everyone got an age

683
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,190
that is younger than their real age.

684
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,980
Aunt Yibai.

685
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,110
Lend me a coat.

686
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,660
Why?

687
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,750
I…

688
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,390
I'm going to meet my advisor,

689
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,810
and I need to dress smart.

690
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,770
You're going to meet your advisor,

691
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,870
not going on a blind date.

692
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,270
Is it really called-for?

693
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,090
Let me try this one.

694
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,610
This one is ugly.

695
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,690
It's so ugly that I don't even wear it.

696
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,130
Jie, you're awesome.

697
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,270
Jie

698
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,360
looks just like us.

699
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,140
He's the same age as us.

700
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,620
How did you fool the app

701
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,230
and make yourself

702
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,630
look like a 22-year-old?

703
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,860
How about you? What's the age you got?

704
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,630
Let me see.

705
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,000
That's impressive, Gu.

706
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,030
If you

707
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,600
had even more hairspray on your hair,

708
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,739
it would be a cinch to detect you

709
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,610
as a 50-year-old entrepreneur

710
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,070
with an elegant demeanor.

711
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,140
Aunt Yibai.

712
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,710
What's the matter again?

713
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,630
T-This cross-body bag.

714
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,580
May I borrow it?

715
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,630
Tell me the truth.

716
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,080
Are you really going to meet your advisor?

717
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,630
You're going to attend a banquet, aren't you?

718
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,630
Yes.

719
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,570
I… I am going to a banquet.

720
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,850
Our department is going to invite the advisors to the banquet.

721
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,890
The alumni are all successful people.

722
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,810
I can't dress too shabby, right?

723
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,230
Aunt Yibai.

724
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,060
Now that

725
00:35:59,090 --> 00:35:59,890
it's all said,

726
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,010
why don't you

727
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,490
lend me the high heels too?

728
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,130
Don't you walk unsteadily

729
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,540
in high heels?

730
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,420
Right, I walk unsteadily.

731
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,720
But we have to grow up.

732
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,190
As I wear them, I'll be able to walk steadily.

733
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,550
I'll take this pair.

734
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,380
Get lost.

735
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,970
Thank you, Aunt Yibai.

736
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,860
Look at how she dressed up.

737
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,990
Going to a banquet to meet her advisor?

738
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,780
It's actually easy to look young.

739
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,220
Look.

740
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,060
Solid color. Floral. You name it.

741
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,180
Get rid of

742
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,090
all your suit jackets, vests,

743
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,440
and three-piece suits.

744
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,340
Change the leather shoes to board shoes.

745
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,570
Ankles.

746
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,890
Show your ankles too.

747
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,700
It's cold.

748
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,490
Only old people are afraid of the cold.

749
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,210
This is it.

750
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,700
OK!

751
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,890
The finishing touch.

752
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,940
You must change your hairstyle.

753
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,490
Don't you dare.

754
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,660
Dear all.

755
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,090
I highly recommend

756
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,910
this dessert.

757
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,560
It's moderately sweet.

758
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,330
What's the number?

759
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,100
What in the world

760
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,300
are you all wearing today?

761
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,980
Don't move.

762
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,750
Don't move.

763
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,470
Is this Mr. Gu?

764
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,210
Why is he dressed like this?

765
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,930
What would you like to drink?

766
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,090
Soy sauce latte

767
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:28,950
is our signature drink.

768
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,080
It tastes very good.

769
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,410
This coriander ice cream

770
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,220
is a new product of the season.

771
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,220
It sells well too.

772
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,800
There's also

773
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,060
Meteorite Mineral Smoothie

774
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,210
that is a must-order.

775
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,770
Why don't you two have a try of all of them?

776
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,270
-Yes.
-No.
