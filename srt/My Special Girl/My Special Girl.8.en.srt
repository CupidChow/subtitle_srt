[Episode 8]

4
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,960
You said that I abused my employees

5
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,600
and I was ruthless.

6
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,870
Is my image that bad

7
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
in your heart?

8
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,670
It's not like that.

9
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,260
Mr. Gu, let me explain.

10
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,240
You're the best boss in the world.

11
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,950
I mean it.

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,360
Okay.

13
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,270
I'm just kidding.

14
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,350
You...

15
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,510
You're joking with me?

16
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,150
How could you do this?

17
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,550
Alright. You're too nervous.

18
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,280
I just wanted to make you relax.

19
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,890
Alright. I'll forgive you.

20
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,950
Yibai.

21
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,960
Yibai.

22
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,460
Mr. Han.

23
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,390
Call me Owen

24
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,700
or Jie.

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,370
What's the matter so early in the morning?

26
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,030
Where did you go so early in the morning?

27
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,090
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

28
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,180
Is this how you treat

29
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,120
your admirer

30
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,750
who spent the night with you?

31
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,510
She hung up on me.

32
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,030
Last night's good memories.

33
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,310
@Chen Yibai.

34
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:51,930
You saw it?

35
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,920
Delete it.

36
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,750
Okay.

37
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,400
Be my girlfriend.

38
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,920
I have a boyfriend.

39
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,160
From what I saw last night,

40
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,240
you don't have a boyfriend.

41
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,840
To be precise,

42
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,550
I think you have broken up with your boyfriend.

43
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,500
Is it that obvious?

44
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
What do you think?

45
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,070
Delete it for me.

46
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,080
Let me be your boyfriend.

47
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,780
Delete it for me.

48
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,270
I won't.

49
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,640
-Will you delete it or not?
-Let me be your boyfriend.

50
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,710
You've started?

51
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,560
Mr. Gong.

52
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,570
Yes, Mr. Gong.

53
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,430
I'm confirming

54
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,830
some details with Yibai.

55
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,430
Okay. Just continue.

56
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,280
According to the requirements

57
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,340
proposed by our client,

58
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,300
we have adjusted

59
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,920
the suppliers accordingly.

60
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,550
When will you and Hao Liang

61
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,350
make an official announcement?

62
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,540
Don't talk nonsense.

63
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,200
What official announcement?

64
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,280
You like her,

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,470
and she likes you, too.

66
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,670
Both of you are single.

67
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,580
Why can't you do that?

68
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,980
Stop being pretentious.

69
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,200
You're afraid.

70
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,600
Because you've never

71
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,520
liked someone,

72
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,160
so you're not sure

73
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,420
how you acutally

74
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,780
feel about Hao Liang.

75
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,510
Is this love?

76
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,880
What else could it be?

77
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,490
Is it possible that

78
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,090
there's another situation?

79
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,540
To me, she is just

80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,070
a distinctive subordinate,

81
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,280
or she's like a sister

82
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,930
who is ten years younger than me.

83
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,110
Now,

84
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,190
I'm not sure

85
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,950
whether this is love between men and women.

86
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,950
If you want to hug your subordinate,

87
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
it's admiration.

88
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,190
If you want to hug your younger sister,

89
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,360
it's family love.

90
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,920
If you want to hug a woman,

91
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,420
it's romantic love.

92
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
What's wrong?

93
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,290
Don't bite the pen.

94
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,960
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,820
This question is too difficult.

96
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,060
When I think carefully,

97
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,460
I like to bite something.

98
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,220
How about this?

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,530
If you solve this question,

100
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,420
I'll give you a reward.

101
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,110
Really?

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,880
What reward can I get?

103
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,870
You can ask for anything.

104
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll make a request arbitrarily?

105
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,690
For example?

106
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,110
Anything is fine.

107
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,570
Say it.

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,030
I...

109
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,720
I...

110
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,500
Say it.

111
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,300
You don't dare to say it?

112
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,380
I want you

113
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,220
to like me.

114
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,190
Forget it.

115
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,580
I don't want any reward.

116
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,790
Well,

117
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,610
I'll send you back to school tonight.

118
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,810
No, thanks.

119
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,480
I'm going back to my Aunt Yibai's house tonight.

120
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,200
It's not far.

121
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,920
It's just three to five kilometers away from here.

122
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,270
Whether you can solve this question or not,

123
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,600
I'll send you back home.

124
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,390
What does Mr. Gu mean?

125
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,720
He's so weird today.

126
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,470
[The elevator is under maintenance.]

127
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,470
[Danger. No entrance.]

128
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,300
Let's take the stairs.

129
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,040
Come on.

130
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,020
Behind you...

131
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,410
What's behind me?

132
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,520
I mistook it for something else.

133
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,450
It's just a lamp.

134
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,440
Let's go.

135
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,710
I'm... I'm sorry.

136
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,540
Mr. Gu.

137
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,350
It's my fault as I was so clumsy.

138
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,710
Oh no.

139
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,280
I've done something so embarrassing in front of Mr. Gu again.

140
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,610
There was a cat in front of the car just now,

141
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,310
so I stepped on the brake.

142
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,980
It turns out that

143
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,500
I didn't hurt him.

144
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,240
Thank goodness.

145
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,750
Mr. Gu,

146
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,650
are you in a bad mood?

147
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,340
We've met some difficulties in

148
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,940
developing the new engine recently,

149
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,480
so I feel stressed.

150
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,210
Let's go.

151
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,280
Who is he?

152
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,830
He's Mr. Gu from our company.

153
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,260
He has just finished tutoring me in my studies.

154
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,920
He also drove me home on his way back to his house.

155
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,590
On his way back to his house?

156
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,700
Is his house really not far from here?

157
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,380
Mr. Gu

158
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,140
cares about his subordinates.

159
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,710
By the way, Aunt Yibai,

160
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,040
do you know what stuff can

161
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,370
help to relieve stress?

162
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,650
Mr. Gu has been under a lot of pressure lately.

163
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,290
He's not my boss.

164
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,420
Please.

165
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,060
Beg me.

166
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,820
I beg you. I'm kneeling down.

167
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,050
Just wait.

168
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,480
Take it.

169
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,570
Pressure Straw.

170
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,020
It contains plenty of Vitamin C

171
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,980
and amino acids.

172
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,120
This is good.

173
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,130
It'll be useful.

174
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,850
Let me ask you.

175
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,910
What is the background

176
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,340
of Jie from your company?

177
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,890
Why did you suddenly ask about him?

178
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,820
He's chasing me.

179
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,550
The door is closed.

180
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,140
What are you doing?

181
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,630
I'm studying

182
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,030
my future girlfriend.

183
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,140
Come on.

184
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,800
I'll project her image on the screen of the television.

185
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,260
You can help me analyze it.

186
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,790
I'm not interested.

187
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,290
What are you angry about now?

188
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,810
Why can't I see this post

189
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,940
from Jie on Moments?

190
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,040
That jerk.

191
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,430
Surprisingly, this post on Moments

192
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,870
is only visible to me.

193
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,330
So when Mr. Gu and I

194
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,330
were locked up,

195
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,820
he went to ask you for help?

196
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,120
What?

197
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,200
Nothing.

198
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,880
Hao Liang.

199
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,210
Tell me the truth.

200
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,940
Actually, last night...

201
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,870
I... I accidentally

202
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,920
broke the electronic lock

203
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
in Mr. Gu's house.

204
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,730
Then we were accidentally

205
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,200
locked up there all night.

206
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,230
Then did you...

207
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,430
No, absolutely not.

208
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,960
Mr. Gu is a decent gentleman.

209
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,540
You swear?

210
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,340
I swear.

211
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,800
Alright.

212
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,870
Let's talk about you and Han Yijie.

213
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,100
He knows the relationship

214
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,820
between you and Dazuo, doesn't he?

215
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,300
He also knows that you'll get married soon.

216
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,700
I broke up with Dazuo.

217
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,630
When did that happen?

218
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,620
Last night.

219
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,240
It was also last night?

220
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,810
Wasn't that the 99th day

221
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,140
for you two being together?

222
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,250
Aunt Yibai.

223
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,410
Can you stop

224
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,550
breaking up with your boyfriend seasonally?

225
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,690
You should hang in there

226
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,220
till the 100th day at least.

227
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,460
Oh, come on!

228
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,860
He cheated on me.

229
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,760
He has an affair. Okay?

230
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,070
That's too much.

231
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,670
Right.

232
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,710
All these 99 days have been wasted.

233
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,560
Right.

234
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,590
You're not sad?

235
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm not sad.

236
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,610
Sometimes,

237
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,270
I just wonder

238
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,349
whether I was

239
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,790
so domineering that

240
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,950
none of them

241
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,329
could stand me.

242
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,329
No.

243
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,829
They are just too incompetent.

244
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,599
They don't deserve my good aunt.

245
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,829
The word "incompetent" is good.

246
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,490
Han Yijie said the same thing.

247
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,760
So will you

248
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,089
accept him?

249
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,160
Han Yijie?

250
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,900
How should I explain this?

251
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,950
Han Yijie is a

252
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,050
good-looking man.

253
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,350
He comes from a good family, too.

254
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,980
After working with him for some time,

255
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,140
I've found that he's also very responsible.

256
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,460
Most importantly,

257
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,640
he likes me very much.

258
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
It seems that

259
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,250
I don't have any reason to refuse him.

260
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,630
But...

261
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,510
But

262
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,510
if Han Yijie and I become boyfriend and girlfriend,

263
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,070
I don't think I can hide the truth that

264
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,470
you're Dai.

265
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,350
Then Gu Jiuli will...

266
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,660
I've never thought that

267
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,280
though we're relatives,

268
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,160
in my path of love,

269
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,790
I need to give way to your crush on a man.

270
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,220
No, no, no. It's not like that.

271
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,150
Aunt Yibai, that's not what I mean.

272
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,250
Aunt Yibai, I'm sorry.

273
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,600
I admit that

274
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,120
when you said that just now,

275
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,130
I did have a little bit of

276
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,110
such a thought.

277
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,510
But if you really want to

278
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,480
be Han Yijie's girlfriend,

279
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,050
I approve of this idea.

280
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,380
Aren't you afraid that the man whom you

281
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,440
have a crush on will know your secret?

282
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,910
Yes, I'm afraid.

283
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,840
But I want to make you happy.

284
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,910
What if

285
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,570
he gets angry and hates you

286
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,180
after he finds out about it?

287
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,250
I'll accept the reality.

288
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,080
Alright.

289
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,140
Now you two are so intimate that

290
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,300
he even drove you back home.

291
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,310
I don't want to be

292
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,990
an annoying person like that.

293
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,660
No, no, no.

294
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,270
Aunt Yibai, you don't have to do this for me.

295
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,130
I won't be Han Yijie's girlfriend.

296
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,900
Why?

297
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,240
He is a

298
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,010
frivolous, childish and pretentious man.

299
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,490
He's even younger than me.

300
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,900
It's impossible that I'll be his girlfriend.

301
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,830
What I said just now

302
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,870
was a lie to you.

303
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,940
How could you do this?

304
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,460
You can handle them yourself.

305
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,010
Come on.

306
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,720
Take a look.

307
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,710
Is there anything you like?

308
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,040
Take whatever you like.

309
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,800
Aren't all these things the gifts

310
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,860
given by Dazuo to you?

311
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,320
Yes.

312
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,020
He sent me a message just now.

313
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,020
He asked me to handle them as I liked.

314
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,310
Do you want them or not?

315
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,710
I'll throw them away if you don't want them.

316
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,610
Take your time.

317
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,090
I dare not say that

318
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,500
your boss has a crush on you.

319
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,560
But at least, he has feelings for you.

320
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,300
Walk inside gracefully

321
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,940
and give the straw to him.

322
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,380
Dan,

323
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,280
you have to believe that

324
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
you deserve to be loved.

325
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,440
The person I like

326
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,480
likes me, too.

327
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,150
Will such a good thing

328
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,120
happen to me?

329
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,680

347
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,430
[Gu Xiaoqing—When reality gets closer to imagination, we can foresee future research about education in the Artificial Intelligence Era.]

348
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,310
I know every Chinese character.

349
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,380
But when they're put together, what do they mean?

350
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,720
I don't understand.

351
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,560
How come there is no one giving likes to me

352
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,620
after I posted something on Moments?

353
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,980
You posted something on Moments?

354
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,360
Alright.

355
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,150
I'll give you a like.

356
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,100
Are you satisfied now?

357
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,060
Why didn't you give me any likes before?

358
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,620
Can you be reasonable?

359
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,830
You only posted something

360
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,030
on Moments every few months.

361
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,680
You're not an active user at all.

362
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,780
It was normal that I couldn't find your posts on my page.

363
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,840
So this is a bug?

364
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,440
Yes, I agree, too.

365
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,540
But for this problem,

366
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,200
you have to complain about it to Zhang Xiaolong.

367
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,250
If a girl

368
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,840
ignored your post on Moments

369
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,300
and didn't give you a like,

370
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
what does it mean?

371
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,220
Hao Liang didn't give you a like?

372
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,760
Alright.

373
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
Let me teach you.

374
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,220
For the first trick,

375
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,030
you need to learn to make up stories.

376
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,180
I wanted to send an article to Han,

377
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,300
but I sent it to somewhere else wrongly.

378
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,400
Do you mean

379
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,820
the article you've just posted on Moments?

380
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,370
You saw it?

381
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,560
It's quite profound.

382
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,870
Which part is profound?

383
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,170
Every part is profound.

384
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:46,970
Boss,

385
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,250
do you want to give me a lesson again

386
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,920
in the middle of the night?

387
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,010
I'm carefully studying the article now.

388
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,350
Mr. Gu, are you busy?

389
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,810
What's the matter?

390
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,160
This is for you.

391
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,050
Pressure Straw.

392
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,090
This straw contains

393
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,240
multivitamins.

394
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,060
You don't like it?

395
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,410
Then I'll take it to...

396
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,610
I like it.

397
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,630
I like it.

398
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,740
Why are you giving this to me?

399
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,740
Yesterday, you said that you were under a lot of pressure.

400
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,550
I hope that

401
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,710
this can help you relieve your stress.

402
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,390
Coincidentally, I also have something to tell you.

403
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,370
I printed out the document

404
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,170
we talked about last night.

405
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,280
If there's any part you don't understand,

406
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,080
highlight it.

407
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,080
I'll explain it to you.

408
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,030
Okay.

409
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,700
I knocked on the door this time.

410
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,070
Isn't this the article which you posted

411
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,330
on Moments last night?

412
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,270
Why did you print it out for her?

413
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,100
Mr. Gu, didn't you say that

414
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,280
Jie also needed to study it?

415
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
How about this?

416
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,770
Jie, you can take it first.

417
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,010
I don't want it.

418
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,440
Well, Hao Liang,

419
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,580
go out first.

420
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,470
I have something to discuss with Han Yijie.

421
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,950
Let me give you an idea.

422
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,900
The Weighted Matrix of Romantic Love.

423
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,800
Whether you love her or not

424
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
will be shown by the data.

425
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,940
According to the ten items about Hao Liang, such as her facial attractiveness,

426
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,420
IQ, personality and so on,

427
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,840
there are ten points at most to each item.

428
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,470
Then you can

429
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,580
distribute the proportions

430
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,380
according to your preferences.

431
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,720
There's a bug.

432
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,500
Just tell me.

433
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,920
What's the reference standard?

434
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
It's simple.

435
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,530
Compare her with

436
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,180
all the real people in the objective world.

437
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,910
For example,

438
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,120
in your heart,

439
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,920
what is the score for Hao Liang?

440
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,550
Three points.

441
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,020
Gu Jiuli,

442
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,160
should I call you a fool

443
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,620
or an idiot?

444
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,270
Fill it out yourself.

445
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,010
[Weighted Matrix of Romantic Love]

446
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,070
Mr. Fei, I have a suggestion.

447
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,630
Our Xiaojiu

448
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
is an intimate companion of children.

449
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,230
Shouldn't we take some photos of

450
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,330
the micro expressions of small animals?

451
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,260
What do you mean?

452
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,860
Now nearly every family

453
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,270
raises cats or dogs as pets.

454
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,900
A small animal like that

455
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,560
is also a member of the family.

456
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,350
Their data

457
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,420
should be collected and added to our facial expressions database.

458
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
That makes sense.

459
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,740
You can set about doing it first.

460
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,700
I'll ask Mr. Gu

461
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,850
to buy some basic data

462
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,980
from a data company.

463
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
What is the score?

464
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,660
Where's Hao Liang?

465
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,070
She's out taking photos today.

466
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,740
Mr. Gu, do you want to talk to her about something?

467
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,420
Nothing.

468
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,980
Mr. Gu,

469
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,730
you haven't forgotten tonight's plan, have you?

470
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,570
What plan is it?

471
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,580
It's your birthday.

472
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,980
You'll invite everybody to a karaoke party for team building.

473
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,970
Have you forgotten it?

474
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,770
Which venue should we go, Mr. Gu?

475
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,420
Hao Liang.

476
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,580
Mr. Gu's birthday party will be held tonight.

477
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,640
Come back quickly.

478
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,720
Isn't it the team building?

479
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,030
How come it's Mr. Gu's birthday party?

480
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,540
This is the tradition of our team.

481
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,070
Hao Liang, come back early.

482
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,680
It's his birthday?

483
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,310
I can't go without bringing him a gift.

484
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,280
♫All of them have been confiscated♫

485
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,910

Come on.

500
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,510
Today is Mr. Gu's birthday.

501
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,560
Let's wish Mr. Gu...

502
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,720
Happy birthday!

503
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,750
Happy birthday.

504
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,020
May you live a long life

505
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,220
and have a child soon.

506
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,980
What are you talking about?

507
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,310
Let's stop singing.

508
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,570
Let's play some games.

509
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,000
I suggest that

510
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,520
we should play this game of Guessing Words with Body Language.

511
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,820
Okay. Let's play this game.

512
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,250
Good.

513
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,740
How do we play it?

514
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,320
How about

515
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,370
asking Mr. Gu and Dan to demonstrate it to us?

516
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,490
Okay.

517
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:52,670
Right.

518
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,330
Demonstrate it to us, Gu.

519
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,630
Mr. Gu, do you know how to play this game?

520
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,690
I'll do it with you.

521
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,320
Has it begun?

522
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,180
Has it begun?

523
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,180
Has he shown the words to you?

524
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,700
Have a common beat in hearts.

525
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,430
I love you.

526
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,570
That's not right.

527
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,180
Heart.

528
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,360
You almost gave the right answer.

529
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,290
-Heart. -Heart.

530
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,400
Heart.

531
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,610
Two hearts merged together.

532
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,410
Wholeheartedly, right?

533
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,200
That's not right.

534
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,060
You almost gave the right answer.

535
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Four words.

536
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,830
Heart.

537
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,810
Make a finger heart.

538
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,860
Heart... Heart to heart...

539
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,470
Have a flourishing life.

540
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,010
Heart to heart collision.

541
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,010
That's not right.

542
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,620
Two hearts.

543
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,450
Link two hearts together.

544
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,730
Is it correct?

545
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,690
Bingo.

546
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,660
Those who didn't give the right answer should drink some wine.

547
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,910
Let's drink.

548
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,360
Let me drink with you guys.

549
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,120
Come on.

550
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,390
Come on, Mr. Fei. Let's drink.

551
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,120
Come on.

552
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,260
[A Kiss for Love]

553
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,100
How do we express this phrase with our body language? Well...

554
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,770
Bro,

555
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,620
don't say that I didn't create a chance for you.

556
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,940
One, one...

557
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,010
Keep kissing.

558
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,420
A lifetime.

559
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,880
One... One's whole life.

560
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,570
Mouth.

561
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,500
That's not right.

562
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:19,900
No, no.

563
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,770
One... One mouth.

564
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,630
Brother Mouth.

565
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,180
Brother Mouth hammers...

566
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,470
A Kiss for Love.

567
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Can you express it more accurately?

568
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,020
Mouth...

569
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,880
What he wants to express is...

570
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,280
One horse takes the lead.

571
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,390
Right. One horse takes the lead.

572
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,400
There's no horse at all.

573
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,030
Keep looking down.

574
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,590
Hurry up.

575
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,420
I'm about to count down.

576
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,110
You have to

577
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,770
express this phrase with your body language.

578
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:37,440
Just move your bodies.

579
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,430
Don't make gestures randomly. Interact with each other.

580
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,990
We won.

581
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,190
Gu.

582
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,330
Is it that diffuclt?

583
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,980
Hurry up.

584
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Move your bodies!

585
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,200
You have to use your body language.

586
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,930
Otherwise, how can we guess it?

587
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:07,910
Really?

588
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,360
Is Mr. Gu really going to...

589
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,000
This is my first kiss.

590
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,400
Am I going to...

591
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,200
It seems that

592
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,550
it's okay

593
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,990
to give my first kiss

594
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,970
to Mr. Gu.

595
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,610
A Kiss for Love.

596
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,370
Am I right?

597
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,460
You talked too much.

598
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,480
Am I right?

599
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,680
What are you doing?

600
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,470
My answer is right. Why are you hitting me?

601
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,570
It hurts.

602
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,730
Don't hit me!

603
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,710
Who hit me just now?

604
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,800
You guys hit me so hard.

605
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,120
It was Mouth. Mouth hit you.

606
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,150
It had nothing to do with me. Okay?

607
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,010
I think it was you.

608
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,770
Let's go.

609
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
You hit me. It hurts!

610
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,060
-I'm leaving.
-See you tomorrow.

611
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,659
Dan.

612
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,949
Are you going back to the dorm?

613
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,630
I can drive you there on my way back home.

614
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,510
She's not going back to the dorm.

615
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,110
It's so late now, and a girl like her...

616
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,580
Stop talking.

617
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,900
No one treats you as a dumb man.

618
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,150
Why are you going to hit me again?

619
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,750
Bye. Bye.

620
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,440
Well, Hao Liang,

621
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,290
you're in charge of

622
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,949
sending your Mr. Gu back home.

623
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,739
Jie, aren't you going back?

624
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,469
I have something to do.

625
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,600
Your Mr. Gu is drunk.

626
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,190
Please

627
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,420
take him home safely.

628
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,590
I'm fine.

629
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,570
He is a man

630
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,310
of strong self-control.

631
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,570
When he's drunk, he tends to be humble.

632
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,030
I'm entrusting him to you.

633
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,060
I called a taxi.

634
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,780
I'll send you back home later.

635
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,060
No need.

636
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,340
Let me send you back home first.

637
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,880
Jie said that he was drunk.

638
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,980
But

639
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,900
Mr. Gu seems to be still working.

640
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,310
Mr. Gu.

641
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,700
It seems that you're holding your mobile phone upside down.

642
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,730
Mr. Gu is really special.

643
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,050
He's drunk in such a distinctive way.

644
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,530
Mr. Gu.

645
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,150
You've got home.

646
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,790
My mission is completed.

647
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,630
Han

648
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,250
asked you to send me home.

649
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,050
This is the entrance door of my house.

650
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,060
It can't be considered as my home.

651
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,120
Open the door.

652
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,590
Why do you want me to open the door?

653
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,330
You know the password.

654
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,190
Mr. Gu.

655
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,290
The password is...

656
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
That's not right.

657
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,000
That's not right.
