[My Special Girl]

3
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,950
[Episode 19]

4
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,340
What are you doing?

5
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,170
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

6
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,510
You've just come back from dinner at the Taikoo Hui Mall?

7
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,360
Yes.

8
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,600
My mom, Dan and I

9
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,750
had dinner together.

10
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,350
We enjoyed the dinner very much.

11
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,150
After dinner,

12
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,750
we even went shopping at the Taikoo Hui Mall.

13
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,150
My mom is very fond of Dan.

14
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,230
Hao Liang said that

15
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,230
you had dinner at the International Commerce Centre.

16
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,590
We went to the International Commerce Centre first.

17
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,930
After dinner, we went to the Taikoo Hui Mall.

18
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,030
Besides, where we went is

19
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,290
none of your business.

20
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,810
I know there's nothing between you two.

21
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,580
But Hao Liang is hiding something from me.

22
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,910
During the daytime, you said that

23
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,770
you didn't want me to cause her

24
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,830
any trouble again.

25
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,170
What exactly did you mean?

26
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,060
Did I say that?

27
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,620
I forgot it.

28
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,450
It's okay if you don't tell me.

29
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,110
But I still want to thank you.

30
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,640
Bye.

31
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,350
You're already working so early in the morning.

32
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,670
What time did you come back yesterday?

33
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,660
It's so ugly.

34
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,410
What is ugly?

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,529
The combination of your clothes looks so ugly.

36
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,990
This is called a surprise.

37
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,430
I told Yibai that

38
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,140
we would go to the Mogan Mountains to work there,

39
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,670
so I need to dress formally.

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,070
These sunglasses

41
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,200
are for sunbathing.

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,230
The leopard-print swimsuit

43
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,430
will also be worn by you in the Mogan Mountains?

44
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,890
Shut up!

45
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,150
Don't say it.

46
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,220
I told you it would be a surprise.

47
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,950
Of course I couldn't tell her

48
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,680
at that time.

49
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,970
Are you sure

50
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,570
Chen Yibai likes surprises?

51
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,270
People make mistakes sometimes,

52
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,000
and horses stumble sometimes.

53
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,380
How dare you question me?

54
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,530
Your girlfriend is going to hook up with someone else soon.

55
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,570
Why are you still drawing a tree diagram here?

56
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,700
This is a tree diagram about Hao Liang.

57
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,300
I think she's hiding something from me.

58
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,900
I want to know more about her.

59
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,290
I'll go find Yibai first.

60
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,670
Wait.

61
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,960
In your eyes,

62
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,250
what kind of person is Hao Liang?

63
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,350
She's my eldest niece.

64
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,820
She's a good girl,

65
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,310
and a little Poor Baby.

66
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,910
What else?

67
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,350
She likes you.

68
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,760
She's your admirer.

69
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,730
I'm going to catch the train. Bye.

70
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,640
By the way,

71
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,940
are these sunglasses really ugly?

72
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,800
Just go at once.

73
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,790
Forget it.

74
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,640
[To be added. She likes me.]

75
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,640
[Admirer]

76
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,820
The door is closed.

77
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,250
Gu has started to suspect you.

78
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,210
Then... what should I do?

79
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,390
It's all right.

80
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,670
I found excuses for you.

81
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,470
Just be careful

82
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,600
in the next two days.

83
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,300
Got it. Thank you, Jie.

84
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,840
It's Han Yijie?

85
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,100
Is your Aunt Yibai at home?

86
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,360
Yes.

87
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,550
I have something important

88
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,210
to tell her.

89
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,870
Okay. Bye.

90
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,720
What did he tell you?

91
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,470
He said that

92
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,550
he had something important to tell you.

93
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,950
What is the important thing he wants to say?

94
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,670
Yibai.

95
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:24,850
Yibai.

96
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,930
Tell me. What's the matter?

97
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,150
There's something urgent.

98
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,030
The food supplier

99
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,750
in the Mogan Mountains

100
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,150
has some problems which need to be solved.

101
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,590
But now no one else is free to do this task during the holiday.

102
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,990
We have to go by ourselves.

103
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,670
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

104
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,270
I've just received the notice.

105
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,630
I already bought the tickets on the way here.

106
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,610
There are still three hours.

107
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,480
Go pack your luggage now.

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,210
Wait for me. It won't take long.

109
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,230
I've drafted the email.

110
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,790
Now I'm adjusting the Gantt chart

111
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,820
for the progress schedule.

112
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,310
After we confirm it with the new supplier,

113
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,110
we can send it.

114
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,380
Don't be nervous.

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,190
The weather in the Mogan Mountains is so nice.

116
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,650
Even the air smells sweet.

117
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,780
A lake-view room.

118
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
It really deserves its reputation.

119
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,790
Look.

120
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,480
What do you think?

121
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,680
This lake-view room

122
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,010
was also booked by you right before we set off,

123
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,070
and you were actually able to book it?

124
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,550
Yes.

125
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,610
I also thought that it was strange.

126
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,640
All the rooms of the business hotels were booked.

127
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,270
But the lake-view room was still available.

128
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,390
What was going on?

129
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,540
But it was too urgent at that time,

130
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,470
so I didn't think too much.

131
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,670
Then I just booked it.

132
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,720
Yibai, come and have a look.

133
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,140
Look.

134
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,870
There are mountains here.

135
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,330
There are lakes here, too.

136
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,760
It feels so comfortable.

137
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,500
Well, we've cooperated

138
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,790
with that supplier so many times.

139
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,390
There have been no problems.

140
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,430
Now Lucas wants to

141
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,590
change this supplier.

142
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,990
I'm just worried that the supplier found by him

143
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,650
can't meet our test standard.

144
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,190
Besides, in the backup plan,

145
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,790
there is a number

146
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,270
which I haven't finished calculating till now.

147
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,530
I'm totally unprepared for his changes.

148
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,660
Alright.

149
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,150
The supplier will definitely pass the test.

150
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,880
Don't worry.

151
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,030
You like eating snacks, don't you?

152
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,990
There are many kinds of snacks in the Mogan Mountains.

153
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,520
Let's go.

154
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,909
How come all that you think about is food?

155
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,030
What time is your appointment with Lucas?

156
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,230
One o'clock in the afternoon.

157
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,960
One o'clock.

158
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,120
That's good.

159
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,750
I think I can finish it in time.

160
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,330
I'll finish it soon.

161
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,510
I'm going to calculate the number.

162
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,830
Yibai, take a rest.

163
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Just take a rest.

164
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,820
Hello, are you Mr. Han?

165
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,790
Yes, I am.

166
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,510
Please sign here.

167
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,100
The car you booked

168
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,800
is already parked in front of the gate.

169
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,050
This is your car key.

170
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:03,970
Bye.

171
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,140
Why did you rent a car?

172
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,740
Isn't it very convenient

173
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,860
to take a taxi here?

174
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,470
Isn't it more convenient

175
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,630
if we rent a car and drive it by ourselves?

176
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,160
Let's go.

177
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:40,970
Come on.

178
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,390
Welcome.

179
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,210
A table for two. I've booked it.

180
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,140
-Okay. Please come in.
-Thank you.

181
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,470
This is the table for us, right?

182
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,330
Come on, Yibai.

183
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,830
Please sit down and wait a moment.

184
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,240
Okay.

185
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,430
This place is so remote.

186
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,560
Can Lucas find it?

187
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,060
Yes.

188
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,390
He said he would arrive soon.

189
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,420
He asked us to order the food first.

190
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,000
Why did you choose this place?

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,490
It's not a suitable place for talking about business.

192
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,120
Lucas suggested that we should come here.

193
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,590
I also don't know

194
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,510
why he chose this place.

195
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,840
This place is so remote.

196
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,880
I need to go to the toilet.

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,210
Just go. Come back soon.

198
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:46,940
Hello.

199
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,990
You two have booked

200
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,040
the most famous speciality in our restaurant,

201
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,710
the Mogan Mountains' Romantic Set Meal for Couples.

202
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,250
Please take a look at the content of the set meal.

203
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,180
Do you want to order any extra food?

204
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,290
A Romantic Set Meal for Couples?

205
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,430
Have you made a mistake?

206
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,030
This meal should be arranged for three people.

207
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,850
I'm not mistaken.

208
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,810
It says

209
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,550
"a set meal for couples ordered by Mr. Han".

210
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,070
It was booked on June 15.

211
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,180
On June 15,

212
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,830
Mr. Han booked

213
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,200
a romantic set meal for couples.

214
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,310
A meal for two people?

215
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,030
Yes.

216
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,230
Our executive chef Lucas

217
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,090
is very famous.

218
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,950
If Mr. Han had not made a reservation ten days in advance,

219
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,740
let alone the set meal,

220
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,510
you wouldn't have got any seats here.

221
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,140
What's the name of your executive chef?

222
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,970
Lucas.

223
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,350
He's very famous here.

224
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,830
Look. Do you need anything else?

225
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,940
There's something urgent.

226
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,850
The food supplier

227
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,540
in the Mogan Mountains

228
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,010
has some problems which need to be solved.

229
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,380
But now no one else is free to do this task during the holiday.

230
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,740
We have to go by ourselves.

231
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,370
What time is your appointment with Lucas?

232
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,030
One o'clock in the afternoon.

233
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,590
I don't need anything else. Just serve the food according to the set meal.

234
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,120
Okay. Please wait a moment.

235
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,910
Excuse me.

236
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,590
The dishes have all been served.

237
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,550
Yibai, look.

238
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,370
This is a must-have drink

239
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,630
for those who visit the Mogan Mountains.

240
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,480
Other people all say that

241
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,260
if you don't drink this

242
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,190
when you're in the Mogan Mountains,

243
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,320
it's like visiting this place in vain.

244
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,150
Taste it.

245
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,800
Two cups?

246
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,070
Yes, two cups.

247
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,150
Lucas called me just now.

248
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,390
He said he was about to reach the door.

249
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,180
But suddenly, there was

250
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,470
an emergency meeting at his company.

251
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,870
He said he couldn't come.

252
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,380
He said sorry.

253
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,070
But we can continue

254
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,120
to communicate with him

255
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,320
in the form of emails.

256
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,720
Just taste it.

257
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,740
We're already here after all.

258
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,710
There are so many types of delicious food.

259
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,510
What's wrong?

260
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,030
You eat.

261
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,280
I'm going back to the hotel.

262
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,030
Waitress.

263
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,000
Pack the food for me.

264
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,460
Okay.

265
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,060
Thank you.

266
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,690
Takeout boxes.

267
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,040
Okay.

268
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,190
Yibai.

269
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,520
Don't worry too much

270
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,550
about the project.

271
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,880
All the problems will be solved in the end.

272
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,040
It happens to be holiday now.

273
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,190
Don't be too nervous.

274
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,510
Although there are obstacles in this project,

275
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,190
we can

276
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,790
take this opportunity

277
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,660
to relax.

278
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,640
Yibai.

279
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,420
What's wrong with you?

280
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,430
If there's any problem, you can tell me.

281
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,510
We can communicate about it.

282
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,460
We can communicate?

283
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,190
Have you communicated with me?

284
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,430
What?

285
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,990
On the 15th, you knew that there would be a problem

286
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,630
with the supplier on the 25th.

287
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,470
Mr. Han,

288
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,820
your foresight

289
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,520
is good.

290
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,480
The supplier's name is Lucas.

291
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,710
The executive chef of the restaurant where we went to

292
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,910
is also called Lucas.

293
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,640
What a coincidence.

294
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,150
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

295
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,970
A surprise?

296
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,760
This is more like a shock, isn't it?

297
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,850
Since you told me that

298
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,180
there was something wrong with this project,

299
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,580
I've never been relaxed.

300
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,630
I kept revising

301
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,960
my backup plan.

302
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,750
Now you're telling me that

303
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,840
this is a surprise?

304
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,710
Yibai.

305
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,990
You're just too nervous.

306
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,840
Besides, I didn't do this on purpose.

307
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,280
I was worried that if I told you about it directly,

308
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,740
you might not come with me.

309
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,410
So you just lied to me?

310
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,420
Han Yijie,

311
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,530
how old are you now?

312
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,680
Has anyone ever told you

313
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,160
not to joke about

314
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,650
anything related to work?

315
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,620
I really didn't mean to lie to you.

316
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,800
I just thought that

317
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,670
you were usually too tense,

318
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,600
so I wanted to find a chance

319
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,020
to take you out to relax.

320
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,290
I was worried that you might have no time and say no.

321
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,550
Therefore, I had no choice but to do this.

322
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,430
I'm sorry.

323
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,030
I won't do this again.

324
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,590
Okay?

325
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,950
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,350
We're already here after all.

327
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,560
Just enjoy it.

328
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,610
Okay?

329
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,670
Hello?

330
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,550
What?

331
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,760
Mr. Gong suffers from cerebral infarction?

332
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,670
There's no ticket at all?

333
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,760
What about a standing-room ticket? A standing-room ticket is also okay.

334
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,630
Yibai.

335
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,900
It's raining heavily outside.

336
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,740
I can't book any tickets, either.

337
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,470
We are unable to go back to

338
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,870
Shanghai for the time being.

339
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,430
No.

340
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,370
No, I must go back.

341
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,830
Calm down, Yibai.

342
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,070
Could you please listen to me?

343
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,870
Just listen to me.

344
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,390
You're not a doctor, Yibai.

345
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,120
It's useless for you to go back.

346
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,430
Trust me.

347
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,150
Mr. Gong will be fine.

348
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,810
The car key.

349
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,120
You've rented a car, haven't you?

350
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,910
Give me the car key.

351
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,510
I'll drive back to Shanghai.

352
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,350
It's raining heavily outside.

353
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,030
You're telling me that you'll drive back to Shanghai?

354
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,780
I'm not asking you to

355
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,610
go back with me.

356
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,150
I'll drive back to Shanghai myself.

357
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,810
The car key.

358
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,830
[1K11 International Finance Center]

359
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,710
Print two copies.

360
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,720
Yang Panpan.

361
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,030
Come to my office.

362
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,920
He summoned me.

363
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,820
He took the initiative to summon me.

364
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,150
He's Hao Liang's boyfriend now,

365
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,070
isn't he?

366
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,700
Could it be that...

367
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,240
he has changed his mind and found that

368
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,080
I'm his Miss Right?

369
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,109
Mr. Gu, you want to talk to me?

370
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,849
Have a seat.

371
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,130
What kind of person

372
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,470
do you think Hao Liang is?

373
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,310
You mean Dan?

374
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,500
We're on good terms with each other.

375
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,180
She is

376
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,790
a kind-hearted girl.

377
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,520
We all like her.

378
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,590
For example, Zhu Yi.

379
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,580
Zhu Yi has dated

380
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,510
so many girlfriends.

381
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:36,950
But

382
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,210
Dan is the only girl who can stay

383
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,140
by Zhu Yi's side.

384
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,790
Last time, Zhu Yi's girlfriend

385
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
came to the dorm to get even with Dan.

386
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,220
Dan was so scared that she hid herself.

387
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,030
In the end,

388
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,550
I helped her solve this problem.

389
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,980
Does she have a dream?

390
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,610
Her dream is...

391
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,740
passing the Higher Mathematics exam

392
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,940
so that she can graduate successfully.

393
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:04,960
Okay.

394
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
You may go out now.

395
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,610
Help me ask C to come in.

396
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,660
Mr. Gu,

397
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,310
is there something you think

398
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,240
it's inconvenient to tell me here?

399
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,750
You can tell me about it in a low voice.

400
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,300
There's nothing.

401
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,030
Fine.

402
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:37,960
Wait.

403
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,510
I'm here.

404
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,740
You can leave

405
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,960
as soon as the internship is finished.

406
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,270
Thank you.

407
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,820
C, Mr. Gu wants you to go inisde.

408
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,070
What kind of person

409
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,260
do you think Hao Liang is?

410
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,160
Hao Liang?

411
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,310
Are you not

412
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,050
talking about Yang Panpan?

413
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,520
I'm asking you about Hao Liang.

414
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,250
What does it have to do with her?

415
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,280
Speaking of Hao Liang,

416
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,490
she's pretty good.

417
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,950
She's kind and ordinary.

418
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,090
She's bad at logic,

419
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,230
but she sings well.

420
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,490
[Outpatient Department]

421
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,990
Hello.

422
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,070
Could you please tell me

423
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,670
which ward Gong Mingqian stays in?

424
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,230
Yibai.

425
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,560
Why are you here?

426
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,750
How is Mr. Gong?

427
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,390
Don't worry. He's fine.

428
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,650
He's lying in the ward.

429
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,950
Fortunately, we found out about his disease early.

430
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,580
The doctor said that

431
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,390
after receiving one more course of

432
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:55,920
the Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber treatment,

433
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,150
he could be discharged from the hospital.

434
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,670
Well, I need to go pay the bill.

435
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,950
Mr. Gong is in Room 555.

436
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,670
See?

437
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,510
I told you Mr. Gong would be fine.

438
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,480
Why did you have to

439
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,440
come back so hurriedly and nervously?

440
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,100
You even risked your own life.

441
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,880
So you mean it's my problem?

442
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,150
I was too nervous

443
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,770
and I even risked my own life?

444
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,680
I don't mean to blame you.

445
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,060
Don't do this again, and it'll be fine.

446
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,270
If you had not tried to give me

447
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,520
a surprise,

448
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,160
we wouldn't have been

449
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,960
trapped in the Mogan Mountains.

450
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,770
I didn't casue the typhoon.

451
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,520
Nor did I make

452
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,730
those planes and high-speed trains halt.

453
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,010
Right. There are no problems with you.

454
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:34,680
You've done nothing wrong.

455
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,280
You are good in every aspect.

456
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,400
Han Yijie,

457
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,710
you never

458
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,530
have a plan for the things you do.

459
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,380
During holiday,

460
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,020
we're supposed to be happy.

461
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,880
I just wanted to

462
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,510
make you happier.

463
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,310
Alright. Stop talking about it.

464
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,910
Let's calm down respectively.

465
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,510
Okay?

466
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,730
Chen Yibai.

467
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,630
What do you mean?

468
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,230
The literal meaning.

469
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,480
Don't follow me.

470
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,290
Go back early and get some sleep.

471
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,940
Coming.

472
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:28,950
Ms. Yibai.

473
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,410
Can we talk?

474
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,110
If you're here

475
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,230
to intercede for someone,

476
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,630
you don't have to do this.

477
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,750
Someone?

478
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,710
Han Yijie?

479
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,170
You're not here for Han Yijie?

480
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,750
Then why are you here?

481
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,750
I'm here to talk with you

482
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,660
about Dan.

483
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,830
Hao Liang likes using an electric fan,

484
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,650
instead of an air-conditioner.

485
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,880
She likes drinking hot lemon tea.

486
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,010
She doesn't like the scent of jasmine.

487
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,560
What are these?

488
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,810
I want to know more about Hao Liang,

489
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,900
so...

490
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,890
Why do you want to know more about her?

491
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,690
She's hiding something from me.

492
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,020
You've worried too much.

493
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,190
Hao Liang told me that

494
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,130
she had dinner with Zhu Yi and Zhu Yi's mother

495
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,330
in the International Commerce Centre.

496
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,860
But Zhu Yi told me that

497
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,390
they had dinner at the Taikoo Hui Mall.

498
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,320
She grew up with Zhu Yi.

499
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,420
There's nothing special between them.

500
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,110
I know.

501
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,050
So I've never suspected them.

502
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,510
However,

503
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,750
it seems that there's something

504
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,510
which you guys know

505
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,270
but I don't know.

506
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,550
What is it?

507
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,330
What is the secret that

508
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,590
Zhu Yi can know

509
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,070
but I can't as her boyfriend?

510
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,750
I'll never regret my love

511
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,100
for Hao Liang.

512
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,510
She's very afraid of losing you.

513
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,670
Then she has worried too much.

514
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,900
One's afraidness

515
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,270
comes from

516
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,760
the fear deep in her heart.

517
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,880
As for what it is,

518
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,350
you have to find out about it yourself.

519
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,180
That's all I can say.

520
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,390
As for this stuff,

521
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,520
I'll give it to her when she comes back.

522
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,030
Okay.

523
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,880
By the way,

524
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,740
you had a quarrel Han Yijie,

525
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,300
right?

526
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,080
Previously, he told me that

527
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,450
he would give you

528
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,060
a surprise in the Mogan Mountains.

529
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,190
Is that it?

530
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,910
I told him that

531
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,350
it might be a shock.

532
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,710
But as you know,

533
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,440
he likes surprises

534
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,920
and creative ideas.

535
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,310
He's confident and unrestrained,

536
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,790
and he's always energetic.

537
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,550
Maybe this is why

538
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,630
you like him.

539
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,390
No.

540
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,830
I don't like these traits.

541
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,690
We are quite similar.

542
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,950
I like making plans for everything I do

543
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,910
so as to lower the error rate to the smallest degree.

544
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,540
I believe that preparedness ensures success.

545
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,510
But obviously,

546
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,470
you think that I'm boring

547
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,540
like this.

548
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,110
Aunt Yibai.

549
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,360
You know what?

550
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,110
Our choreographer

551
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,810
is just like a devil.

552
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,430
I'm exhausted.

553
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,510
I need to take a rest.

554
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,400
Then I'll get changed and do the live stream show.

555
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,110
Drink this.

556
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,280
Gu Jiuli came here today.

557
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,410
He didn't tell me about it.

558
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,430
He came to talk to me,

559
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,470
not you.

560
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,740
Why did he want to talk to you?

561
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,750
I'm afraid

562
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,930
your secret can't be hidden anymore.

563
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,910
Why?

564
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,600
Dan likes drinking hot lemon tea.

565
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,310
Once,

566
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,540
she drank five cups of it successively.

567
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,350
It seems that she doesn't like the wind from air-conditioners.

568
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,240
She never sits in front of

569
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,270
the air outlets of air-conditioners.

570
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,850
She is

571
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,410
a kind-hearted girl.

572
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,130
She's bad at logic,

573
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,310
but she sings well.

574
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,350
Are you really not going to tell him

575
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,830
why you did this?

576
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,920
If I tell him,

577
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,770
will he not like me?

578
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,350
At first,

579
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,630
I didn't hold an optimistic attitude towards you two indeed.

580
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,490
The gap between you two is too big.

581
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,500
But Gu Jiuli

582
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,120
let me see his efforts.

583
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,670
There were 100 steps ahead of you and him.

584
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,390
He already walked 99 steps.

585
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,600
There's only this short distance left.

586
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,930
You're not even willing to take this step?

587
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,550
You're about to do the live stream show?

588
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,980
You've said that you and Hao Liang are acquaintances.

589
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,000
Has she ever told you

590
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,630
what she's afraid of?

591
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,230
Why do you want to know

592
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,430
what she's afraid of?

593
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,270
I want to tell her

594
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,930
no matter what happens, don't be afraid.

595
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,100
I'll always be in front of her to protect her.

596
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,640
What if after you know it

597
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,070
and find that she's not like

598
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,670
what you have thought at all,

599
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,770
but she's someone else

600
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,590
whom you can't accept at all?

601
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,590
It doesn't matter.

602
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,590
I like her for whom she is,

603
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,950
not the person I imagine.

604
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,940
I want to know more about her,

605
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,010
because I want to love her in a better way.

606
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,630
However,

607
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,950
as her boyfriend,

608
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,610
I don't seem to be good enough.

609
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,300
So I want to make up the lessons.

610
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,870
What do you want to eat later?

611
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,090
Anything is fine.

612
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,900
If you know it,

613
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,270
I really hope that you can tell me.

614
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,040
We can make an appointment.

615
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,330
Let's do it after the live stream show

616
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,710
or when you're free.

617
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,930
It's okay if you don't know it.

618
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,230
It's just that you once told me

619
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,920
you two would chat with each other.

620
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,770
I know what she's afraid of.

621
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,520
After your live stream show is finished,

622
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
I'll wait for you.

623
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,210
You can talk to me anytime.

624
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,310
It won't take that long.

625
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,150
Watch my live stream show tonight.

626
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,550
I'll tell you the answer.

627
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,480
See you there.

628
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,400
Mr. Gu.

629
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,580
Good evening, everyone.

630
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,670
I'm a Siren female streamer

631
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,410
who is going to conquer you with my voice and beauty.

632
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,960
I'm going to sing the song,

633
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,760
It's Loading.

634
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,990
It's for

635
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,400
a special friend

636
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,230
♫Open my love manual♫

637
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,960

♫I'm waiting to watch♫

639

♫The rainbow with you♫

640
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,430
♫The little dots keep spinning♫

641
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,550
♫And eventually, they will connect with each other to form a line♫

642
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,850
♫Waiting for us to hold hands♫

643
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,990
♫Let's draw concentric circles together♫

644
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,870

♫Look at the screen♫

647

♫To see the circle that keeps spinning♫

648
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,190
♫The dots chase each other to connect together to form a line♫

649
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,290
♫And the line will turn into a circle♫

650
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,960

♫It's loading, where you are♫

656
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,430
Today, this is

657
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,280
a very special live stream show for me.

658
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,420
I have something

659
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,210
to tell you all.

660
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,620
Are you

661
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,800
watching this show?

662
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,510
In my life,

663
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,830
there have been two occasions where I felt very nervous.

664
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,310
One was the college entrance exam.

665
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,990
The other one

666
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,510
is probably now.

667
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,590
What is Ms. Dai talking about?

668
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,350
Is something wrong going to happen?

669
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,840
Where are the Quick-acting Heart-saving Pills?

670
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,600
I won't listen to it.

671
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,290
What do you want to say?

672
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,210
I'm in love.

673
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,070
That boy

674
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,090
asked me what I was most afraid of.

675
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,640
Mr. Gu.

676
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,860
Mr. Gu.

677
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,990
Mr. Gu.

678
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,870
Do you go running every day?

679
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,270
Mr. Gu, I'm fine.

680
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,660
Mr. Gu, let me explain.

681
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,950
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

682
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,830
Mr. Gu.

683
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,710
Mr. Gu.

684
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,720
Mr. Gu.

685
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,830
Mr. Gu.

686
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,750
Mr. Gu.

687
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,470
I'm most afraid that

688
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,940
after you know this different me,

689
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,260
you won't love me when I'm like this.

690
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,650
Hao Liang.

691
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,260
♫I'm trying so hard to look for♫

692
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,580
♫The answer that may not exist♫

693
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,130
♫I'm embracing♫

694
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,400
♫Those transient and wonderful moments♫

695
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,450
♫How extraordinary should I be♫

696
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,830
♫To look ordinary?♫

697
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,040
♫The lonelier I am♫

698
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,870
♫The more I look forward to a happy ending♫

699
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,130
Why?

700
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,760
It seems that in the end,

701
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,760
Mr. Gu can't forgive me for having lied to him.

702
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,890
Are you going to

703
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,130
-break up with me?
-Break up with me?

704
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,230
Okay.
