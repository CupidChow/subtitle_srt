00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,000
[Episode 10]

4
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,370
I was drunk last night.

5
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,470
Did I...

6
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,790
Say something?

7
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,640
You not only said things you shouldn't have said

8
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,840
but also did things you shouldn't have done.

9
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,390
However, after sobering up, you should feel regret

10
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,150
for those actions, right?

11
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,390
No?

12
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,640
But I remember

13
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,600
you sent me home.

14
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,470
Yes.

15
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,880
I left you at the door.

16
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,190
Should I tell you the truth?

17
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,520
Letting you know that you've done

18
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,500
so many boring things for a girl

19
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,740
you don't even like

20
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,760
will only make things awkward for both of us.

21
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,660
Tomorrow is the weekend.

22
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,320
Will you go somewhere with me?

23
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:18,950
So handsome.

24
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,870
His legs are so long.

25
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,050
Is he a teacher in our school?

26
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,050
He has a nice body.

27
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,400
He's so handsome.

28
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,079
Handsome.

29
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,130
Is the person next to him

30
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,130
his girlfriend?

31
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,960
He wore a suit to school.

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,020
It's quite formal.

33
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,270
So handsome.

34
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,430
So handsome.

35
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,400
I really want his phone number.

36
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,680
Are you afraid of being seen

37
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,230
walking with me?

38
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,070
No, not at all.

39
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:04,990
Mr. Gu.

40
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,070
What are we...

41
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,640
I want you to have the home-field advantage.

42
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,630
The factors affecting performance

43
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,020
include subjective

44
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,440
and objective factors.

45
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,550
In terms of subjective factors,

46
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,230
after this period of training,

47
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,709
I think you can achieve

48
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,690
a score of over 100 points.

49
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,110
So today, we're here

50
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,310
to eliminate objective interference.

51
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,990
How?

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,390
Where do you usually take exams?

53
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,370
The staircase classroom in the Red Mansion.

54
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,270
Let's go.

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,470
What's wrong with you?

56
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,630
You haven't handed in your homework for two days.

57
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,570
All of you are

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,270
taller than me.

59
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,710
And you still need me to watch over you?

60
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,159
What a trouble.

61
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,320
Thunderbolt Woman.

62
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,590
Hurry back, be quick.

63
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:53,590
What's wrong?

64
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,390
My Higher Mathematics teacher.

65
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,150
Are you trying to avoid her?

66
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,390
Hao Liang.

67
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:00,950
Yes.

68
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,470
It's really you.

69
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,190
How's your review going?

70
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,670
I'm...

71
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,940
I'm reviewing.

72
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,870
Your head teacher came to me two days ago

73
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,030
to plead for you.

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,710
But you only got 69 points.

75
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,830
Out of 150 points in total,

76
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,070
you got 69.

77
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,300
If I let you pass

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,840
with such a score,

79
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,750
it would be extremely

80
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,270
irresponsible of me.

81
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,150
Yes.

82
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,230
You're right.

83
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,230
Hao Liang.

84
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,580
Math

85
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,070
is a fundamental subject.

86
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,530
If you're not good at math,

87
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,830
it means your logical thinking is weak.

88
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,440
Someone without logic,

89
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,240
when they

90
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,190
encounter a slightly

91
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,600
complex situation

92
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,600
at work,

93
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,750
won't be able to figure it out

94
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,950
and will make mistakes.

95
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,630
By then,

96
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,030
no boss would dare to hire you.

97
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,960
Whoever hires you will be unlucky.

98
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,510
If I don't be strict with you now,

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,640
in the future,

100
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,350
you will become

101
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,830
a burden to society.

102
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,560
Hao Liang.

103
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,570
You've completely lost face.

104
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,170
Ma'am.

105
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,090
Can we talk in private?

106
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,480
Who are you?

107
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm her family.

108
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,280
-Family?
-Uncle.

109
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,990
Family.

110
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,570
Similar.

111
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,150
Handing me a low score isn't sufficient.

112
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,860
Do you two also need to discuss

113
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,840
my daily foolishness?

114
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,870
Here's the thing.

115
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,090
I'd like to ask

116
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,360
how you view Hao Liang's

117
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,450
math performance.

118
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,380
Let me put it this way.

119
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,310
She lacks a foundation.

120
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,060
Is there any possibility

121
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,080
of other factors?

122
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,980
For example...

123
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,590
For example, being in a romantic relationship.

124
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,060
Romantic relationship?

125
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,100
You

126
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
heartless and cruel adults,

127
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,150
have you said enough

128
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,800
bad things about me?

129
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,710
I haven't heard about that.

130
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,250
Hao Liang

131
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,630
seems to be quite close

132
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,010
to a guy from the Economics department.

133
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,050
Boyfriend?

134
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,950
You'll have to ask her about that.

135
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,230
Mr. Gu.

136
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,090
What did Thundering Woman

137
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,410
just tell you?

138
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,920
We were discussing

139
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,080
the issue of your academic performance

140
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,120
not improving.

141
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,560
Because I'm stupid.

142
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,780
She said your mind

143
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,409
isn't on your studies.

144
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,560
My mind isn't on studies?

145
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,960
Did Thunderbolt Woman

146
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,120
find out about

147
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,150
my live-streaming activities

148
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,070
and tell Mr. Gu?

149
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,590
Is that true?

150
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,750
I... I don't know.

151
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,460
Do you have a boyfriend?

152
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,580
Does having a relationship

153
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,830
affect your grades?

154
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,740
No, I'm not in a relationship.

155
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,070
Did Thunderbolt Woman say my mind

156
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,110
isn't on studies

157
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,320
because I'm in a relationship?

158
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,260
So,

159
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,040
is there or isn't there?

160
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
There isn't.

161
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,160
I work during the day and review at night.

162
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,559
I don't have time to date.

163
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,299
That makes sense.

164
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,309
So, you usually

165
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,240
take exams here?

166
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,510
The make-up exam is in three days.

167
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,840
Let's do

168
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,200
a simulation exam test.

169
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,860
The duration is 90 minutes.

170
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,130
Are you confident to get 100 points?

171
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,730
I...

172
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,200
Will you be disappointed

173
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,270
if I can't get 100 points?

174
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,560
You lack confidence even before the exam?

175
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,350
Mr. Gu.

176
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,750
Did I pass?

177
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,690
Guess.

178
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,230
Is it less than 100?

179
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,910
I...

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,500
I didn't go easy on you.

181
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,660
This is the first time

182
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,000
I've passed Higher Mathematics since I entered college.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,390
I'm so, so happy.

184
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,410
How are you going to thank me?

185
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,250
I...

186
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,120
Excuse me.

187
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,180
Hello?

188
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,670
Not tonight.

189
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,840
I have something to do.

190
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,910
Something?

191
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,150
Does that mean tutoring for me?

192
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,770
Am I holding him back again?

193
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:39,990
Mr. Gu.

194
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,200
Thank you for

195
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,750
tutoring me during this time.

196
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,600
From now on, you'll be free.

197
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,550
Free?

198
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,910
Yes.

199
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,710
The exam is in three days.

200
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,070
I won't trouble you anymore.

201
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,470
Mr. Gu.

202
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,150
Your mission is completed.

203
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,510
Are you happy?

204
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,510
Your knowledge of multiple integrals and differential equations

205
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,640
is still quite weak.

206
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,470
I'm not trying to get full marks.

207
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,660
I just need to pass.

208
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,670
Mr. Gu,

209
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,670
you have so many things to do.

210
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,810
Don't let me delay

211
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,070
your important tasks.

212
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,750
Please.

213
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,800
I finally made up my mind.

214
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,440
Don't look at me

215
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,160
like that.

216
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,310
I'll really regret it.

217
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,310
Dan, let me tell you.

218
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,310
Big gossip.

219
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,590
The one in the next class

220
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,120
broke up.

221
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,520
Is that the Mr. Gu

222
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,570
you mentioned?

223
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,390
Hello, handsome boss.

224
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,730
My name is Yang Panpan.

225
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,750
Well,

226
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,490
there's a newly opened taro stall

227
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,020
at the gate of the school.

228
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,870
It looks delicious.

229
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,790
Let's try it.

230
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,350
No need.

231
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,030
I have something to do. I have to go.

232
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,150
Dan.

233
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,040
I've been looking for you.

234
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,270
Why didn't you answer your phone?

235
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,310
What's up?

236
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,970
It's not convenient here.

237
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,910
About Dai?

238
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,830
Is he the person you like?

239
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,700
Shut up.

240
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,650
Mr. Gu, we have things to do.

241
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,510
We're leaving.

242
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,020
Is this really the last lesson?

243
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,870
Dan's matters are my matters.

244
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,710
You can come to me if you need anything.

245
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,750
I forgot to introduce myself.

246
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,370
I'm Zhu Yi.

247
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,190
I'm Dan's best friend, majoring in economics.

248
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,530
I'm more than capable of tutoring her in Higher Mathematics.

249
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,440
Hao Liang

250
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,950
seems to be quite close

251
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,230
to a guy from the Economics department.

252
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,910
I see.

253
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,700
I have something to do.

254
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,320
I have to go.

255
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,710
Bye.

256
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,210
They're gone.

257
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,820
Just say what you want to say.

258
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,190
I'm speechless.

259
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,800
I just saw the notice board.

260
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,550
She says she will punish you in tomorrow night's live broadcast,

261
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,950
which is eating mustard.

262
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,350
This woman is so disgusting.

263
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,100
You are both singers.

264
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,500
She's intentionally damaging your voice.

265
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,510
I'm talking to you.

266
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,150
I'm talking to you.

267
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,750
Don't just say "Huh".

268
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,310
I'm worried sick

269
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,510
about your situation.

270
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,170
Is your mind

271
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,250
completely occupied by that man now?

272
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,290
What about Cute Mengmeng?

273
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,760
I don't know.

274
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,390
You still don't know?

275
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,310
Do you still want to participate in the Qixiu Grand Ceremony?

276
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,290
Do you want your mom to find out

277
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,490
about your career as a streamer openly?

278
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,430
I really can't do it.

279
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,670
I'm so weak.

280
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,340
I can't do anything right.

281
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,060
I'll only cause you trouble

282
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,140
and make you worry.

283
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,110
I'm such a disappointment.

284
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,750
Alright.

285
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,310
What should we do?

286
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Zhu Yi.

287
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,590
I don't want to be punished.

288
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,870
But it's not good

289
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,710
not to acknowledge defeat.

290
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,230
Zhu Yi.

291
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,990
Why am I so unlucky?

292
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,600
Who is to blame?

293
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,830
During that showdown, you were singing your strongest song,

294
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,670
but you voluntarily admitted defeat.

295
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,710
Enough.

296
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,390
That was a special situation.

297
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,560
Special situation?

298
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,940
I think you were

299
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,820
with your boss.

300
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,170
Let me ask you.

301
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,810
If I ask you to give me a grade,

302
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
how many points will you give me?

303
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,510
Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?

304
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,060
Alright, I got it.

305
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,860
Stop talking.

306
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,540
Mr. Gu.

307
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,160
Is this your car?

308
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,720
Our dorm is far away.

309
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,060
Can you give me a ride?

310
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,620
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

311
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,510
Mr. Gu.

312
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,790
Well...

313
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,710
He's quite unique.

314
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,130
36 points.

315
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,180
What the hell?

316
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,490
If you want me, I'll give you eight...

317
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,300
Full marks.

318
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,930
Don't comfort me.

319
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,810
This month

320
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,760
is the happiest

321
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,630
of my life.

322
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,720
For the first time,

323
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,190
I met someone I liked.

324
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,440
And I got

325
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,620
a chance

326
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,510
to stay by his side.

327
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,070
At first, I thought

328
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,060
as long as I could see him every day,

329
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,550
I'll be happy.

330
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,980
But gradually,

331
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,270
he started to stand up for me in public,

332
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,390
caring about my subtle feelings

333
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
and even helping me with my studies.

334
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,520
So I became greedy,

335
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,040
wondering

336
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,030
if he might

337
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,680
have a tiny bit

338
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,930
of affection for me.

339
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
But he was drunk that day.

340
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,030
I took him home.

341
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,829
What he told me

342
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,480
and did to me...

343
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,770
What did he do to you?

344
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,280
What did he do to you?

345
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:19,950
Nothing.

346
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,349
You...

347
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,720
Nothing.

348
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,109
Actually,

349
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,349
I misunderstood.

350
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,950
All this time,

351
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,510
I misunderstood.

352
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,630
When I saw that note,

353
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,560
I came to my senses.

354
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,440
I am someone

355
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
who is not pretty, not smart,

356
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,320
and timid.

357
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,410
I even messed up the only thing

358
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,040
I'm good at, live streaming.

359
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
Who would like me?

360
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,480
Let me tell you.

361
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,630
He's definitely an abusive man,

362
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,520
stingy,

363
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,830
a Mama's boy,

364
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,760
and lazy.

365
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,600
Maybe he even has athlete's foot.

366
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,440
You should be glad

367
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,560
you've completely avoided a scumbag.

368
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,850
Don't talk about him like that.

369
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,060
He gave you 36 points.

370
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,860
And you're still defending him?

371
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,840
I don't deserve him.

372
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,430
This is my problem.

373
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,190
Zhu Yi.

374
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,120
Being dumped is so painful.

375
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,160
Why do you still

376
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
like dating so much?

377
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,010
How would I know?

378
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,040
Then tell me

379
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,590
how your ex-girlfriends

380
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,630
get through this.

381
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,440
I don't know.

382
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
Send a message to ask them.

383
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,160
No.

384
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,800
It's okay to ask.

385
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,780
Where's your phone?

386
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,390
Where is it?

387
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,220
It's okay to ask.

388
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,240
Send it via your phone.

389
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,770
Where's your phone?

390
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,570
Are you crazy?

391
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,380
Give it to me.

392
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,940
Send it via your phone.

393
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,080
Please.

394
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,950
No.

395
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,500
You won't even help me with this small favor?

396
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,060
[Han Yijie]

397
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,050
Hello? What's wrong?

398
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,880
Come out.

399
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,030
Is something bothering you?

400
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,840
Lend me money.

401
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,180
I've thought about Xiaojiu's problem.

402
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,510
First, build a cloud server

403
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,290
to connect the network.

404
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,630
The issue of computing power

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,600
can be solved using servers.

406
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
It should be fine.

407
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,880
Gu Jiuli,

408
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,580
I've been waiting for this statement for ten years.

409
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm done.

410
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,920
Let's switch positions.

411
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,150
What?

412
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,080
Is it about making the engine

413
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,040
write its own

414
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,260
program?

415
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,650
There's no precedent for this in the world.

416
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,960
Oh my god.

417
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,480
That's a miracle.

418
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,270
This is the engine of the ages.

419
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,650
Non Human

420
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,800
really has inhumane intelligence.

421
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,470
Okay, everybody, the time is over.

422
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,690
Please take the keyboard off the keyboards.

423
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,320
Thank you.

424
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,960
Congratulations to Infinite Team

425
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,230
for winning the championship of the year.

426
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,930
Thank you.

427
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,510
Good job.

428
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,100
Thank you.

429
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,160
Congratulations.

430
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,120
Thank you.

431
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,500
Ten years ago,

432
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,860
we could turn the tide.

433
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,370
Ten years later,

434
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,240
Xiaojiu will surely rise

435
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,180
to prominence.

436
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,760
Do you know?

437
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,340
In this world,

438
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,500
only two and a half people believe you.

439
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,750
The first one.

440
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,150
Master Ka.

441
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,560
He believes in you as a person

442
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,970
but not in your ability,

443
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
counting as half.

444
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,840
The other

445
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,190
is me.

446
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,880
And

447
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,860
there's also Hao Liang.

448
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,470
She

449
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,260
seems a little strange today.

450
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,770
What?

451
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,590
What's wrong with you two?

452
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,120
I was tutoring her.

453
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
She called it off.

454
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,790
Could she

455
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,320
be falling

456
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
for someone else?

457
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,850
The goals I set before

458
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,620
are never impossible to achieve.

459
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,320
But this time, it seems like

460
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,840
Hao Liang might withdraw first.

461
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,350
If the mountain doesn't come to me,

462
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,830
I'll go to the mountain.

463
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,560
Yibai, I like you.

464
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,260
Be my girlfriend.

465
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm willing to watch sunrise and sunset with you.

466
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,240
Girls like this?

467
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,190
Of course.

468
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,660
This is my secret weapon

469
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,560
for a successful confession tomorrow.

470
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,490
Watch and learn.

471
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,630
Let me watch it again.

472
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,930
Yibai, I like you.

473
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,700
Be my girlfriend.

474
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,720
I'm willing to watch sunrise and sunset with you.

475
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,130
These

476
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,760
are the budget details of our project.

477
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,610
If you

478
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,830
have no questions,

479
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,680
let's start looking into

480
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,740
the situation of the place of origin.

481
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,580
Isn't this

482
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,240
USB drive yours personally?

483
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,780
This is a department's shared USB drive.

484
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,580
What's wrong?

485
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,220
Nothing. I'm just asking.

486
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,390
Fire corals

487
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,580
contain highly toxic cnidocytes.

488
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,340
Contact with the skin

489
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,030
will cause a burning sensation

490
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,140
and lead to swollen lymph nodes.

491
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,820
During the full moon,

492
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,320
fragments of fire corals

493
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,720
float to the sea surface,

494
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,580
forming...

495
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,750
Yibai, I like you.

496
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,410
Be my girlfriend.

497
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,500
I'm willing to watch sunrise and sunset with you.

498
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,890
What's going on?

499
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,190
I don't know.

500
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,060
The USB drive belongs to Yibai.

501
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,560
Sorry, Mr. Gong.

502
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,670
But I'm not very clear

503
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,290
about the situation today.

504
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,330
What exactly is going on?

505
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,200
I don't know.

506
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,980
You don't know?

507
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,150
You gave the USB drive to Yongkang.

508
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,740
In this video,

509
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,080
somebody confessed to you.

510
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,360
You say you don't know?

511
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,360
Mr. Gong.

512
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,410
You know

513
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,360
what kind of person I am.

514
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,120
There's no way I can't distinguish between professional and personal matters.

515
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,890
But what happened today

516
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,040
is my fault.

517
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,550
I didn't check the materials well.

518
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,680
Okay, stop talking.

519
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,640
I know.

520
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,780
The situation with Dazuo

521
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,890
before your wedding

522
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,370
was a blow to you.

523
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,760
But I hope

524
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,720
you'll be cautious about such important matters as marriage.

525
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,360
Mr. Gong, I really didn't...

526
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,880
It's good

527
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,050
that someone likes you.

528
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,050
But I think this expression

529
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,330
is inappropriate.

530
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,360
Moreover, it happened in front of

531
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
such important business partners.

532
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,340
How will they see us now?

533
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,270
Look.

534
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,240
Owen hasn't been

535
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,840
affected by this little incident.

536
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,100
Look at your attitude.

537
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,540
Yes.

538
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,110
Later, apologize to him

539
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,920
in private.

540
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,630
What?

541
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,280
Okay.

542
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,270
Also,

543
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,880
the guy

544
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,480
who confessed to you,

545
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,680
I don't care who he is,

546
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,930
but you need to handle it properly.

547
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,810
I hope

548
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,520
it won't happen again.

549
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,390
Okay.

550
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,850
Owen.

551
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,010
Let's conclude our discussion here for today.

552
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,390
Okay.

553
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,050
Alright.

554
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,670
Owen.

555
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,760
Yibai has some details

556
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,910
to discuss with you.

557
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:03,690
Sure.

558
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,670
Okay.

559
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,160
You two talk.

560
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,700
Okay.

561
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,300
I apologize.

562
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,590
I'm sorry.

563
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,400
I apologize

564
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,410
because I thought

565
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,270
that the USB drive was your personal one,

566
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,800
not for the content inside.

567
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,180
Okay.

568
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,500
Do you want to know my answer now?

569
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,400
First,

570
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,520
I don't plan to date now.

571
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,390
Second,

572
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,760
I can't be a cradle snatcher.

573
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,490
Third,

574
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,250
I'm not interested in you at all.

575
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,800
Do you hear me?

576
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,180
Need me to elaborate?

577
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,950
Do you want to hear my answer?

578
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,800
First,

579
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,570
I have enough patience to pursue you.

580
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,680
You can take your time to think about it.

581
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,320
Second,

582
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,480
we're only three years apart.

583
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,550
What's the big deal with three years?

584
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,320
Third,

585
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,640
everything can be cultivated.

586
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,160
I'm confident

587
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,780
that I can win you over.

588
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,460
What do you like about me?

589
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,470
I'll change it, okay?

590
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,360
I like both your strengths and weaknesses.

591
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,390
How will you change it?

592
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,920
Strengths and weaknesses?

593
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,240
Do you know me?

594
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,160
Do you know what kind of person I am?

595
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,420
Do you know what I hate?

596
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,000
Do you know if I prefer sweet or savory tofu pudding?

597
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,280
Do I eat tangyuan or dumplings on the Winter Solstice?

598
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,410
Is my staple food rice or steamed buns?

599
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,830
You know nothing.

600
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,300
Yet you're acting like

601
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,820
I'm indispensable.

602
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,550
Han Yijie.

603
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,000
It's funny, you know?

604
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,910
Glutinous rice balls.

605
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,550
Rice.

606
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:43,790
Sweet.

607
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
This is my answer.

608
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,340
I don't know if it's the same as you.

609
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,310
But

610
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,320
it doesn't matter if it's not the same.

611
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,490
Love is not about cloning

612
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,350
an identical version of oneself.

613
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,050
Do you know what love is?

614
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,570
Love is even if our perspectives don't match,

615
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,340
even if I don't fancy your features,

616
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,140
I still insist on being with you.

617
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,240
I may not understand you enough,

618
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,030
but...

619
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,920
But I like

620
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,010
the way you light up

621
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,060
when facing street snacks

622
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,190
that others disdain

623
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,060
when sitting by the roadside.

624
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,880
I like that version of you.

625
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,070
But what I like even more

626
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,560
is the vulnerability you showed

627
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,030
on that rainy night.

628
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,120
Yibai.

629
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,920
I want to protect you.

630
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Give me a chance.

631
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,150
Okay?

632
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,470
I think my answer

633
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,760
has been clear enough.

634
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,110
Sorry.

635
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,770
Chen Yibai.

636
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,040
I won't give up.

637
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,480
M... Mr. Han,

638
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,160
I won't give up on this project.

639
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,750
Yes.

640
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,320
Happy cooperation.

641
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,490
Happy cooperation.

642
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,500
By the way,

643
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
are you free later?

644
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,470
I...

645
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,360
Auntie Yibai, you're back.

646
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,820
You're eating that again?

647
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:54,610
Hello.

648
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,200
Is this Dai's house?

649
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:56,790
Yes.

650
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,350
Hello.

651
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,980
This is a delivery

652
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,110
from Cute Mengmeng.

653
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,240
Sorry to bother you.

654
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,840
Thank you.

655
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,670
Aunt Yibai.

656
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,320
I don't want to go live later.

657
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,670
Okay.

658
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,560
Call Mr. Niu

659
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,920
saying you want to quit.

660
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,880
Tell him

661
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,970
that you are devastated due to a breakup,

662
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:26,920
the end of the world is coming,

663
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,780
and you don't want to do anything.

664
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,050
That's not true.

665
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,200
What should I do?

666
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,530
Alright.

667
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,520
I'll mix some green juice for you

668
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
with a taste and color

669
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,410
similar to fake wasabi.

670
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,600
Seasonal boyfriend?

671
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,300
Everyone on the team knows

672
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,360
that Yibai's every ex-boyfriend

673
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,950
lasts no more than a hundred days.

674
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,550
So,

675
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,740
she has a curse

676
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,170
of seasonal boyfriends.

677
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,590
Eat more of these river shrimps.

678
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,100
The river shrimps here are very famous.

679
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,880
Okay.

680
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,160
So strange.

681
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,540
Not strange.

682
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,830
Her former boyfriend

683
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,770
also ran away because

684
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,970
he couldn't stand it.

685
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,430
Doesn't she have any other hobbies?

686
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,480
Yi Bai

687
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,330
is a somewhat famous streamer.

688
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,010
Streamer?

689
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,320
Let me show you.

690
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,980
Although we

691
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,460
specialize in nutrition,

692
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,880
she specializes in live streaming dark cuisine.

693
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,830
I was as surprised as you

694
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,090
when I first found out.

695
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,830
Take a look.

696
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,430
Don't mind me. Eat more.

697
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,200
We can order more if it's not enough.

698
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,130
Scroll down. There is a lot behind.

699
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,410
Yes, the basic step of this dish

700
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,190
is like this.

701
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,480
Hello, Dai.

702
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,390
Hello.

703
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,320
Your background is so special today.

704
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,320
Today,

705
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,360
because I wasn't streaming

706
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
at a fixed time,

707
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,130
I chose to go live from home

708
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,190
to meet everyone.

709
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,100
My dear fans all know that today,

710
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,430
Dai is challenging herself

711
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,330
with wasabi

712
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,560
as a punishment.

713
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,440
I truly feel sorry for her

714
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,220
because I know wasabi

715
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,310
is very spicy.

716
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,200
I've tried it myself.

717
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,070
But

718
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,760
the fans are very persistent.

719
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,680
Dai.

720
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,660
I'm sorry.

721
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,610
Let's stick to the bet.

722
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,150
Have you received the wasabi

723
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:20,990
I sent you?

724
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,690
Good.

725
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,160
Now, let me share

726
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,670
a little secret with everyone.

727
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,940
Because

728
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,100
I was worried that Dai might cheat,

729
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,380
I secretly

730
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,630
added a little something

731
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,390
to the wasabi.

732
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,600
Dai.

733
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,460
Can you squeeze some out

734
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,450
and show it to us?

735
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:41,650
Alright.

736
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,850
I'll mix some green juice

737
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,260
for you with a taste and color

738
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,460
similar to fake wasabi, just to be safe.

739
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,090
If you haven't switched it out...

740
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,850
That one over there.

741
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,220
That one looked the same.

742
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,800
That's right.

743
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,090
Yes, that's the one

744
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,850
I sent.

745
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,940
I was afraid you'd find it too spicy,

746
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,670
so

747
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,230
I added a bit of sugar to it.

748
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,300
So,

749
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,969
I have a small request.

750
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,020
Well,

751
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,300
can you

752
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,719
sing while eating the wasabi?

753
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:27,670
Sure.

754
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,469
How much should I eat?

755
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,030
Two centimeters.

756
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,639
♫Like raindrops♫

757
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,270

00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,720
♫Only then is it a good dream♫

772
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:49,730
Dai

773
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,900
is really amazing.

774
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,870
Come on.

775
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,430
Dear viewers in my livestream,

776
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,690
go to her livestream,

777
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,680
follow her, and give her a like.

778
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,300
That's all

779
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,570
for today's livestream.

780
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,570
See you next time.

781
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,710
Wait.

782
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
I have something to say.

783
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:08,960
Go ahead.

784
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,870
The wasabi just now

785
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,630
is the punishment for losing the battle.

786
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,210
Thank you, Cute Mengmeng.

787
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,510
Your appearance

788
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,540
made me realize who I am.

789
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,440
In the past,

790
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,250
I used to think

791
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,950
I was the queen of Qixiu,

792
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,010
but it turns out

793
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,090
I just didn't encounter

794
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,150
strong opponents.

795
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,170
Your appearance

796
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,640
made me see

797
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
my shortcomings.

798
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,290
The second bite

799
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,720
is to apologize to my fans.

800
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,010
Before the livestream,

801
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,000
I wanted to be a deserter.

802
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,270
I even thought

803
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,220
about changing the wasabi Cute Mengmeng gave me.

804
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,640
But I thought of you guys.

805
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,760
For the past two years,

806
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:16,810
you've...

807
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,960
You've been with me,

808
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,820
supported me,

809
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,320
and transformed me from an unknown

810
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:26,850
into a somewhat

811
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,020
popular streamer.

812
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,990
I can't let you down.

813
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
From now on,

814
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,000
even if only one person

815
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,330
watches my livestream,

816
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,210
I'll continue to sing

817
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,460
and become a better Dai.

818
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,570
Come at me if you dare.

819
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,320
Go easy on Dai.

820
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,680
I will unfollow Cute Mengmeng.

821
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,270
Join me if you think the same.

822
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:48,930
Cute Mengmeng.

823
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,470
Please disappear immediately.

824
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,950
And in the end,

825
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,860
I want to punish myself.

826
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,990
In the last live competition,

827
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,940
I was distracted

828
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,120
because of something else.

829
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,180
I didn't do my best.

830
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,090
This is disrespect to my opponent,

831
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,080
my fans,

832
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,280
and myself.

833
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,830
From now on,

834
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,310
I won't give up on myself

835
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,650
and won't blame anyone anymore.

836
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,850
I want to cherish

837
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,650
everything I have now

838
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,930
and work harder.

839
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Enough.

840
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,190
No need to eat more. Dai.

841
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,260
It's okay.

842
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,110
Hao Liang must be

843
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,940
someone others look up to.

844
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,540
-Great! Great!
-Aunt Yibai.

845
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,660
I did it.

846
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,140
I'm about to cry. Great.

847
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,590
[Zhu Yi]

848
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,850
Hello?

849
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,720
You're awesome.

850
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,200
I have both good and bad news.

851
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,180
Which one do you want to hear first?

852
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,910
Just tell me.

853
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,080
We've overcome all the difficulties.

854
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,600
Okay.

855
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,880
The bad news is

856
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,310
Mr. Niu wants you

857
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,130
to extend

858
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,150
each livestream by thirty minutes.

859
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:32,730
Why?

860
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,410
Because of the good news.

861
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,230
You set an unprecedented

862
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,760
click-through rate today.

863
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,320
The backstage messages are overflowing.

864
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,780
Thousands of comments are cheering for you.

865
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,620
You've turned adversity into an advantage.

866
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,790
Mr. Niu finally understands

867
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,510
even a great outsider

868
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,640
can't compare to the loyalty of your fans

869
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,200
who have followed you for years
