Let go.

Once it's revised, send it to me.

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,840
Okay.

192
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,290

193
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,280

202
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,810
Good evening, everyone.

203
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,850
I'm A Dai.

204
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,280
An enchanting siren of a streamer,

205
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,640
captivating through voice and beauty.

206
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,300
Mr. Gu.

207
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,090
Here are the rules for the voting.

208
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,280
Since our Hua's Group

209
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,400
is the exclusive sponsor,

210
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,780
the streamer you choose

211
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,920
will receive

212
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,750
an additional 15% score.

213
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,920
The other four sponsors

214
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,950
are co-sponsors.

215
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,570
So their selected streamers

216
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,290
will only receive

217
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,690
an additional 10% score.

218
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,490
-Okay.
-Now,

219
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,040
Hua's Group

220
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,130
and Weixing Culture have yet to vote.

221
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,370
We have six and a half minutes left

222
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,490
before our live streaming channel

223
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,330
closes.

224
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040

225
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,610

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,370

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,370
This Cute Kitty

229
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,570
is actually quite good.

230
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,040
Now, I'll present everyone with a song,

231
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,970
"I Have Myself."

232
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,870

most of the judges' votes.

245
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,590
If you don't make a comeback soon, there won't be time.

Mr. Niu, I'm sorry.

00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,050

I'm sorry.

292
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,820
Your engine

293
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,500
didn't pass our test.

294
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,410
According to the contract,

295
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,090
we can only withdraw our investment.

296
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,620
But there was no such clause

297
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,800
in the contract.

298
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,490
The right to explain the contract

299
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,840
belongs to Party A.

300
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,070
I heard

301
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,440
you also invested in SmileTech,

302
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,570
a foreign company

303
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,440
with a similar research direction

304
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,390
to Jiuqian.

305
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,150
Yes.

306
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,220
SmileTech's official website claims

307
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,840
that their care robots

308
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,470
are using the Tianti Engine,

309
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,190
which was exposed

310
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,470
for having a backdoor

311
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,200
vulnerability in 2013.

312
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,140
We all know that.

313
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,980
And Tianti

314
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,860
swiftly fixed it.

315
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,200
But was it truly fixed,

316
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,690
or did they use one bug

317
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,050
to fix another?

318
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,560
Additionally, this is the competitive analysis

319
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,400
our company conducted

320
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,590
on SmileTech last month.

321
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,300
Their accompanying care robots

322
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,480
are developed for the European and American markets.

323
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,750
However, as widely known,

324
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,590
the emerging

325
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,620
global consumer market is in China,

326
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,170
where women and children

327
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,890
constitute the primary consumer groups.

328
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,360
Therefore, if you hastily reject us,

329
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,550
a tech company

330
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,910
with a local

331
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,810

332
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,000
believe me,

333
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
you'll be missing out on a gold mine.

334
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,130
Mr. Gu.

335
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,500
You only scored 56%

336
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,910
in the evaluation

337
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,600
of your product's operating engine.

338
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,790
Give me two months,

339
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,880
and I'll ensure this data

340
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,770
surpasses that of SmileTech.

341
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,850
Don't forget

342
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,250
that SmileTech scored

343
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,630
78% in the evaluation.

344
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,930
I'm confident.

345
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,220
Have you thought about the consequences of doing this?

346
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,280
The company's funding chain will be broken.

347
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,040
And according to the previously

348
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,280
signed wager terms,

349
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,970
we must redeem at a high interest rate.

350
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:44,820
Alright,

351
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,660
I'll wait for your good news

352
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,160
in two months.

353
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,050
This is absurd.

354
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,400
We moved

355
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,520
because we thought the second investment

356
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,360
would arrive,

357
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,570
and now they want to withdraw.

358
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,830
Is everything they said true?

359
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,610
If it escalates to

360
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,890
buying back investors' shares,

361
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,620
not only Jiuqian but I'm afraid

362
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,090
you'll be dragged into it as well.

363
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,150
You don't trust me?

364
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,410
How about we delay

365
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,930
the payment of salary and bonuses

366
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,000
for a while?

367
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,850
Just proceed with the payments.

368
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,320
Actually, several leaders from Hua's Group

369
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,350
have mentioned

370
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,900
that we're all family here, no need to be formal.

371
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,820
Actually, if they're willing...

372
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,940
During this time,

373
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,990
help me with two things.

374
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,600
Go ahead.

375
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,270
In comparison to SmileTech,

376
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:02,830
our advantage lies in

377
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,440
localizing for the Chinese market.

378
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,680
Hence, the construction

379
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,520
of the micro-expression database is crucial.

380
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,510
Please make sure to promptly select

381
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,330
the right person

382
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,290
for the role of the micro-expression collector.

383
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,960
Understood.

384
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,090
What's the second thing?

385
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,130
The second...

386
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,490
These people

387
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,880
excel at everything but work.

388
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,010
They're top-notch in leisure activities.

389
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,470
I'll go and call them back.

390
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,620
Back then, I always thought...

391
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,230
Yeah, always at the top.

392
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,490
I was sure I'd secure the first place from the start.

393
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,170
It's okay.

394
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,050
A Dai.

395
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
Some people are just lucky.

396
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,200
What's so impressive about luck?

397
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,490
Luck

398
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,640
is also a kind of strength.

399
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,620
Congratulations.

400
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,060
You were fantastic just now,

401
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,330
especially during your singing,

402
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,990
the votes were shooting up...

403
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,930
Girls.

404
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,810
Look.

405
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,760
Who is that?

406
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,870
So handsome.

407
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,630
So handsome.

408
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,640
I heard that the tech company across us

409
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,300
is owned by the young master of the Hua's Group.

410
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,770
The young master started a business?

411
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,880
That's cool.

412
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,130
Which of these two is the young master?

413
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:27,960
You guys should

414
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,520
read more financial magazines.

415
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Come, take a look.

416
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,010
Gu Jiuli, 30 years old,

417
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,490
graduated from Stanford.

418
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,890
So young?

419
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,840
He spent five years

420
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,410
turning the bankrupt family business

421
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,670
into one of the top three in the industry.

422
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,710
Impressive.

423
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,200
He devoted himself to the technology industry last year.

424
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,430
He mentioned previously

425
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,180
that he wanted to create

426
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,490
a new type of care robot.

427
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,810
That's admirable.

428
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,670
I love this kind of man.

429
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,700
Can I add you on WeChat?

430
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,110
I don't use WeChat.

431
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,360
You're back.

432
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,750
How was it?

433
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,660
Did you get it?

434
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,490
No WeChat account?

435
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,290
How is that possible?

436
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,920
Clearly, he just doesn't want to give it to me.

437
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,530
Maybe

438
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,420
they don't have WeChat?

439
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,860
Right?

440
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,530
How could it be?

441
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,460
Stop it.

442
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,530
Watch me.

443
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,860
I'll vent your anger.

444
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:35,850
Wait for it.

445
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,830
You're awesome.

446
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,330
Come on.

447
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,680
Come on, let's go see.

448
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,160
Let's go.

449
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,800
Let's go.

450
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,920
Excuse me.

451
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,430
Has she changed her clothes?

452
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,090
Mr. Gu, it's a different girl.

453
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,880
You're new here,

454
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,210
if you have any questions,

455
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,350
feel free to ask me.

456
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,100
Can you help me throw the trash over there?

457
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,860
Thank you.

458
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,280
You're so bad.

459
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,900
She's coming. She's coming.

460
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,760
Handsome, look at us.

461
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,790
We're here.

462
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,640
He's so mean.

463
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,780
We don't need this man.

464
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,840
He looks ordinary.

465
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,170
He didn't give it to me.

466
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,940
He's actually quite handsome.

467
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,660
One was an innocent lolita,

468
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,230
the other a voluptuous beauty.

469
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,230
Both were decent.

470
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,040
European double eyelids,

471
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,760
high nose bridge,

472
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,090
an inch-thick foundation,

473
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,200
and colorful eye shadows.

474
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,530
A different race from us men.

475
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,950
If you can't differentiate them, just admit it.

476
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,970
What's with the talk about "a different race"?

477
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,040
I didn't defend

478
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,160
my "different race" effect.

479
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,850
I only made

480
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,810
general conclusions

481
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,250
based on sample observations

482
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,910
and drew general inferences.

483
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,710
They just wanted to

484
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,100
add you on WeChat.

485
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,550
It's not like everyone is interested in you.

486
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,880
I don't know about that.

487
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,780
Not adding

488
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,260
doesn't pose any risk

489
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,460
and keeps me at peace.

490
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,180
Adding

491
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,210
has no benefits,

492
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,040
only the risk of being bothered.

493
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,810
Considering these factors,

494
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,380
not adding is the optimal choice.

495
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,100
Do you

496
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:12,710
have to run every situation

497
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,520
through your head

498
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
like a program?

499
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,160
Isn't that tiring?

500
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,290
It's easier than acting on instincts.

501
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,390
I haven't paid you for the ride yet.

502
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,160
I took your ride.

503
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,140
It's nothing.

504
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,920
I don't like owing people.

505
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,770
Add me on WeChat. I'll transfer the money to you.

506
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,800
Mr. Gu, it's almost done.

507
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,490
Let's go...

508
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,890
Mr. Gu.

509
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,250
Are you narcissistic?

510
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,400
I found a bug in you.

511
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,420
I think she just wanted to repay the money.

512
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,560
A bug?

513
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,240
Wait.

514
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,550
Only half a year's content is visible?

515
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,120
Just one piece of tech news.

516
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,940
Hello, everyone.

517
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,470
I'm your Yibai.

518
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,130
I'm delighted to be with you

519
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,610
in the live stream room.

520
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,870
Today,

521
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,500
it's the long-awaited

522
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,050
Five Tough Drinks tasting.

523
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,110
Sweet aftertaste.

524
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,180
It tastes good.

525
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,410
Aunt Yibai.

526
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,450
I'm back.

527
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,120
Let's not try

528
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,300
this flavor.

529
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,080
I think

530
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,140
leaving it there is fine.

531
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,090
Alright, dear friends.

532
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,650
That's all for today's

533
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,540
Five Tough Drinks tasting.

534
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,020
Have a nice night.

535
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,120
Bye.

536
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,820
Today, I won in the preliminary round

537
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,090
of the Qixiu Grand Ceremony,

538
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,520
and it was a comeback against all odds.

539
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,680
I heard about it.

540
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,860
In the end, there was a killer move

541
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,230
revealing your face.

542
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,050
Isn't that so?

543
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,050
Also,

544
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,550
a new company moved in

545
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,950
across from our company.

546
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,410
The boss is very handsome.

547
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,020
I think I might

548
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,640
have a crush on him.

549
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,820
As a female streamer,

550
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,760
shouldn't you be more broad-minded?

551
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,890
Nowadays,

552
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,750
handsome men

553
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,740
are everywhere.

554
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:08,660
No.

555
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,840
He's different.

556
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,530
He's a gentleman.

557
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,670
And faithful.

558
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,230
A handsome,

559
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,360
wealthy man,

560
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,200
courteous,

561
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,510
and faithful to women.

562
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,210
Watch out,

563
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,410
he might be as naive in love

564
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,570
as you are.

565
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,210
No way.

566
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,890
I think he's interested in me.

567
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,260
Why?

568
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,380
How can you say he's interested in you?

569
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,690
Many girls in our company

570
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,420
went to add him on WeChat today.

571
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,030
Dou Miao, Lady Xuan, and Cute Kitty.

572
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,170
They all stuck to him like glue.

573
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,250
He ignored them all.

574
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,490
Even my colleague Xiaoyue,

575
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,360
who has a better figure

576
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,680
than both of us,

577
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,290
didn't catch his eye.

578
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
When I went to him,

579
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,300
I succeeded immediately.

580
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,440
You're still too young,

581
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,210
kiddo.

582
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,820
Continue imagining.

583
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,060
I'm going to bed.

584
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,070
Good night.

585
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,400
Good night, Aunt Yibai.

586
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,850
Are you narcissistic?

587
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,050
I found a bug in you.

588
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,940
I think she just wanted to repay the money.

589
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,060
A bug?

590
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,660
Can't sleep?

591
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,210
[Yes]

592
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,000
Be reserved. Be...

593
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:20,890
You too.

594
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,550
Since you refuse to accept the money,

595
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,030
let me send you

596
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,360
a song I sing.

597
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,760
Thank you.

598
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,010
It's beautiful.

599
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,380
Good night.

600
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,720
Sweet dreams.

601
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,480
Hao Liang.

602
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,520
If I remember correctly,

603
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,780
today is your final exam for advanced mathematics, right?

604
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,640
Aunt Yibai.

605
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,710
Can you not bring up

606
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,410
such a sad thing early in the morning?

607
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,220
You're still talking about being sad.

608
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,860
Hurry up.

609
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,920
Breakfast is ready.

610
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,880
Aunt Yibai.

611
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,210
Do you think

612
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,910
I should send a WeChat message

613
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,000
to that person?

614
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,430
Should I say "good morning,"

615
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,190
"morning,"

616
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:18,950
or "good morning"

617
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,110
with a cute emoji?

618
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,230
Isn't this done like this?

619
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,000
That man replied.

620
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,980
What did he say?

621
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,560
Why... Why did he delete me?

622
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:50,960
Good night.

623
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,060
Sweet dreams.

624
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,050
See, I was right.

625
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,690
Her every move

626
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,570
after adding me on WeChat

627
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,460
was predicted by me.

628
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,310
So my prediction has no bugs.

629
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,750
Mr. Gu.

630
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,640
After all this,

631
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,160
are you trying to prove to me

632
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,970
that your logical reasoning is correct?

633
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:13,610
Yes.

634
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,650
Add him back.

635
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,250
Forget it.

636
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,720
You were brave last night.

637
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,230
Last night was last night.

638
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,630
Now is now.

639
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,040
Yesterday, you were the popular streamer,

640
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,840
A Dai,

641
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,030
and today you're just a coward, Hao Liang?

642
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,080
Aren't they both you?

643
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,410
What's the difference?

644
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,170
There is one.

645
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,820
Okay, tell me.

646
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,070
If he finds out

647
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,950
that A Dai is just an ordinary

648
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,330
senior college student,

649
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,190
he definitely won't like me then.

650
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,930
You need help, seriously.

651
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,920
Get up now.

652
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,310
Xie.

653
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,790
Dan and I

654
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,280
have been childhood friends.

655
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,330
I always thought

656
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,320
you and I would

657
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,600
end up together.

658
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,140
But her parents and my parents

659
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,460
arranged a marriage contract for us

660
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,520
when we were young,

661
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,020
so we will have to get married

662
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,280
as soon as we graduate.

663
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,190
That's so poor.

664
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,160
It's okay. I don't blame you.

665
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,730
If I were to blame anyone,

666
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,170
it would be me

667
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,890
for not meeting you earlier.

668
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,470
Xie. Don't take it too hard.

669
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,980
You'll definitely

670
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,780
meet a better man

671
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,580
in the future.

672
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,040
If you... In the future...

673
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,780
Remember to come to me.

674
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,240
I wish you happiness.

675
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,810
That's so heartless.

676
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,820
She hasn't gone far.

677
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,640
Don't come to me for such things again.

678
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,020
Okay, to thank you,

679
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,250
let me care about you.

680
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,110
How was the interview

681
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,830
last time?

682
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,010
I got the offer.

683
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,100
But I declined it.

684
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,300
You declined a job offer you got?

685
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,100
Are you crazy?

686
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,560
A classmate from the Chinese department

687
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,740
interned at that early education

688
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,650
training center.

689
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,930
I asked her about it.

690
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,190
She said they work overtime

691
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,110
until 9 p.m.

692
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,850
9 p.m.?

693
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,330
That won't do.

694
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,820
It will affect your live stream at night.

695
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,430
But

696
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,530
if you're always unable to find a job,

697
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,060
how are you going to explain

698
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,120
to your family's matriarch?

699
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,160
I've thought it through.

700
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,280
If I don't want the daytime job

701
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,930
to affect my evening live streaming,

702
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,750
there's only one solution.

703
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,160
Look.

704
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,520
I joined

705
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,870
the K11 white-collar recruitment group.

706
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,180
And then?

707
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,200
I'm planning

708
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,630
to cast a wide net and gather more opportunities.

709
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,550
I feel

710
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,310
it's better to get it over with.

711
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,990
You should just

712
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,650
come clean with your mom soon.

713
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,890
Last time, I called my mom

714
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,390
and told her about a classmate

715
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,430
who's a live streamer.

716
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,600
She said, "A respectable female university student

717
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,280
works at a nightclub.

718
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,860
She's morally bankrupt

719
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,900
and shameless."

720
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,040
She's been a director of education

721
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,240
for thirty years after all.

722
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,370
If my mom finds out

723
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,190
that the female student I mentioned

724
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:08,870
is me,

725
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,290
she'll probably kill me.

726
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:11,970
But

727
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,720
I've got my ticket

728
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,990
to the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

729
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,180
If the Qixiu Grand Ceremony

730
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,780
is broadcast on Mingzhu TV,

731
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,000
then I'll count as

732
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,370
someone who's been on TV.

733
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,810
Then my mom won't think

734
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,070
I'm not doing a proper job.

735
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,750
Sis.

736
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,600
There's only six months left.

737
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,510
Your top priority

738
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,840
is to find a job quickly.

739
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,780
Let's go.

740
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,330
If

741
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,400
I really get a job at K11,

742
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
will I have a chance to meet that guy?

743
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,780
[The person with the most beautiful look in K11, Like Monk Tang, the next Jack Ma]

744
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,550
I heard that the tech company across us

745
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,150
is owned by the young master of the Hua's Group.

746
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,639
It'd be great if I could get close to him

747
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:36,969
and get to know him.

748
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,330
Jiuqian?

749
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,570
It's his company, right?

750
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Aren't they good?

751
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,150
Look at Yang.

752
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,440
A graduate of the University of Science and Technology.

753
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,320
And Lin.

754
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,140
A high-achieving student. He's quite suitable.

755
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,310
Well, Mr. Gu.

756
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,680
These five candidates

757
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,270
applying for the micro-expression collector job

758
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,110
were carefully chosen by me after much consideration.

759
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,840
If you're not satisfied again,

760
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,940
I'll really go on strike.

761
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,200
Didn't you say the same thing yesterday?

762
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,860
It seems my credit

763
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,390
has gone bankrupt with you.

764
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,630
Well, Mr. Gu.

765
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,850
I even asked the aunts

766
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,750
who work for the neighborhood committee

767
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,890
to help me find candidates.

768
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,820
I really don't know what else to do.

769
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,950
Do you want some?

770
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,400
Bro, I'm not in the mood.

771
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,480
If you don't want any of this, get out.

772
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,970
Hello, your milk tea is ready.

773
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,570
Thank you.

774
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,210
It's cold.

775
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,000
I forgot to mention no ice.

776
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,570
Time for the door-to-door visits.

777
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,630
Come on, Hao Liang.

778
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,650
[The cutest in the company]

779
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,080
Hello, everyone.

780
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,450
My name is Doris.

781
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,560
I'm 23 years old.

782
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,680
I was born in Shanghai.

783
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,820
I graduated from

784
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,700
Shanghai University of Technology and Science.

785
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,660
Thank you very much.

786
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,310
Next, Hao Liang.

787
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,790
Sorry.

788
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,810
I want to try.

789
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,170
It's right across Qixiu.

790
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,330
And

791
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,110
that way, I can see that guy every day.

792
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,510
No.

793
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,280
He will recognize me, right?

794
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,110
I still can't

795
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,340
take the risk easily.

796
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,060
It's better to keep fewer people informed

797
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,050
about my dual identity.

798
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,610
Miss, are you getting off or not?

799
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,070
Are you getting off or not?

800
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,020
Sorry.

801
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,250
Are you ready

802
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,950
for the live stream later?

803
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,680
Almost done.

804
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,680
You are going to have a live stream?

805
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,040
Yes.

806
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,850
You're early.

807
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,250
I came early to get ready.

808
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,670
What took you so long?

809
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,170
What are you waiting for?

810
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,420
Here. Come here.

811
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,510
Come here.

812
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,690
Hurry up!

813
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,980
He's in the left office.

814
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,530
Yuan, your package.

815
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,790
Thank you. Mouth.

816
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,140
Mr. Fei.

817
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,560
Okay.

818
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,540
The document.

819
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,690
Mr. Gu, the delivery is here.

820
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,680
I'm screwed.

821
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,270
He'll recognize me.

822
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,840
This is bad.
