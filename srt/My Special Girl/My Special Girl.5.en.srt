[Episode 5]

4
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,430
No wonder

5
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,600
you're not interested in Dai.

6
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,160
So you like

7
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,320
poor girls like her.

8
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,380
Jiuli.

9
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,180
Take off your hoofs.

10
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,890
You're not thinking about how to optimize the engine,

11
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,390
yet you're constantly dealing with these matters?

12
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,120
I regret letting you come back.

13
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,440
There's more

14
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,170
to pursuing a girl than just offering her tutoring.

15
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,500
Do you want to ask me?

16
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,110
Your internet celebrity

17
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,710
got you out of the blacklist?

18
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,430
She's playing hard to get.

19
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,550
I can get her WeChat account

20
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,590
at any moment.

21
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,350
Don't take it seriously.

22
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,900
Awesome.

23
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,470
I'm talking to you about the poor girl.

24
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,930
Don't change the subject.

25
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,390
What do you think

26
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,770
of the R&D team of Jiuqian?

27
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,000
Shi Fei is reliable.

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,490
Yuan and mouth

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,590
are skillful

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,880
in their own fields.

31
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,430
Master Ka is quite tough.

32
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,710
C...

33
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,540
He's quite imaginative.

34
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,620
It's just...

35
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,430
What is it?

36
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,440
It's just you

37
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,010
are not that good.

38
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,620
Yes.

39
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,900
Did I hear it right?

40
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,829
You admitted it?

41
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,620
Or what should I do?

42
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,710
It's simple.

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,740
Walk out from here.

44
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,960
Stand there.

45
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,110
Tell everyone

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,710
that you are

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,110
the creator of Non Human.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
And?

49
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,360
I'm managing a team,

50
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,090
not personal admiration.

51
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,310
What I need to do

52
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,070
is to bring everyone together

53
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,760
and move forward together.

54
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,360
To bring everyone together.

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,030
How?

56
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,560
Like

57
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,880
how you taught Hao Liang Higher Mathematics?

58
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
I can do something

59
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,050
that they can't do.

60
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,630
You talked nonsense

61
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,520
so seriously.

62
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,750
I almost believed it.

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,990
Get out.

64
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,790
No.

65
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,830
C.

66
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,710
Since you like it so much,

67
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,230
take it.

68
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,630
This is for you.

69
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,560
Really?

70
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,790
Thank you.

71
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,430
Dan, well...

72
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,630
I'm sorry for what happened before.

73
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,060
It's okay.

74
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,200
Actually, I was not targeting you.

75
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,090
I'm mad at Mr. Gu.

76
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,790
Why?

77
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,350
Because he changed.

78
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,570
How?

79
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,610
Do you know

80
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,730
why I chose

81
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,750
to work for Mr. Gu?

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,470
When I graduated,

83
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,150
I could have joined Google.

84
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,430
But I chose Mr. Gu

85
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,800
because

86
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,600
his words touched me.

87
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,220
He said

88
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,120
we should not only have a Chinese heart

89
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,670
but also a Chinese core.

90
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,900
So,

91
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,460
he wanted to start with the care robots

92
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,470
and create AI robots

93
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,159
that can impress foreigners.

94
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,909
And do you know that

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,200
Mr. Gu was great

96
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,030
before he started his business?

97
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,120
Mr. Han told me

98
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,890
he is the CEO

99
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,840
of Hua's Group.

100
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,030
Hua's Group

101
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,110
is the property left by his parents.

102
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,820
I heard that Mr. Gu took over

103
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,260
before he graduated.

104
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,510
At that time,

105
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,070
didn't think highly of him.

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
But Mr. Gu

107
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,830
spent a few years

108
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,120
to transfer a company burdened with debt,

109
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,550
which is going to be discharged soon

110
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,280
into a company with a market value of ten billion.

111
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,750
Amazing.

112
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,520
Later,

113
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,000
Mr. Gu said he wanted to start his own business.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,040
Mr. Fei told me

115
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,280
that Mr. Gu

116
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,430
didn't take a penny from Hua's Group.

117
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,070
All the initiative funds

118
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,400
were raised by himself.

119
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,670
Do you know

120
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,890
where we lived then?

121
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,590
We worked

122
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,760
in a warehouse

123
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,110
in the suburbs.

124
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,220
That place

125
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,580
had no air conditioner.

126
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,750
It was cold in winter

127
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,230
and hot in summer.

128
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,700
But we were very happy.

129
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,510
Because we all

130
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,370
worked hard for the same goal.

131
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,700
After the company got money,

132
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,610
we moved here.

133
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,500
Then, Mr. Gu changed.

134
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,520
How?

135
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,710
Mr. Gu wants to create an engine.

136
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,910
He became conceited.

137
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,640
Although I don't deny

138
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,400
that Mr. Gu

139
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,650
is a technical nerd,

140
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,560
But

141
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,450
the difference between understanding technology and writing engine programs

142
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,190
is like the difference between

143
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,720
a top student and a prodigy.

144
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,100
A prodigy?

145
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,800
What's the difference?

146
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,890
Listen.

147
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,570
A top student

148
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,710
got full marks

149
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,200
because he worked hard.

150
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,230
And a prodigy got full marks

151
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,250
because that's the cap

152
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,980
on the test paper.

153
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,570
Do you understand?

154
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,450
Forget it. Let's not talk about this.

155
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,620
Although Mr. Gu

156
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,840
is good,

157
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,100
he can't

158
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,620
create an engine.

159
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,390
What should we do?

160
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,760
But it's okay.

161
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,830
We've

162
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,670
figured out a way for Mr. Gu.

163
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,670
Thank you.

164
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,880
Alright.

165
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm here to talk business with you.

166
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,910
Recently,

167
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,710
someone has been looking for Non Human online.

168
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,310
When we want to

169
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,550
restart this project,

170
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,510
it's such a coincidence that someone came to look for it.

171
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,710
Is there any problem?

172
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,590
No.

173
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,880
I know who's looking for it.

174
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,760
Almost there.

175
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,390
Come on.

176
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,640
Almost.

177
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,429
Almost.

178
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,549
Why isn't it working?

179
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,750
So difficult?

180
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,540
Master Ka.

181
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,980
How many levels did you set?

182
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,780
Three levels.

183
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,270
But look.

184
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,570
He fooled me again.

185
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,890
What are you talking about?

186
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,820
We're looking for

187
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,230
the creator of Non-human.

188
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,750
What is Non-human?

189
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,620
Over there.

190
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,960
A yet-to-be-commercialized

191
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,670
independent engine.

192
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,400
Maybe it can be used by Xiaojiu.

193
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,440
Can it solve

194
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,600
Xiaojiu's problem?

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
Of course.

196
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,080
Its founder

197
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,420
was the once globally celebrated

198
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,270
“Infinity Group,”

199
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,330
driving the world crazy at that time.

200
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,510
What is that?

201
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,390
Why should I start

202
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,190
this topic?

203
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,190
Kaggle platform,

204
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,860
the most famous

205
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,080
computer program algorithm Platform.

206
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,510
In 2010,

207
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,000
at the inaugural Internet Algorithm Competition,

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
a duo group

209
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,360
called Infinity

210
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,630
brought with them

211
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,900
the original Non Human.

212
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,990
and appeared out of nowhere.

213
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,110
They won a million US dollars prize.

214
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,150
All big companies

215
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,730
were trying their best to find them

216
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,840
and buy Non-human.

217
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,890
But the next day,

218
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,650
when it was about to present the award,

219
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,550
the Infinity Group

220
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,280
didn't show up to get the award.

221
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,200
They created a miracle

222
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,110
on the Internet of the world.

223
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,570
After a short appearance,

224
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,180
they disappeared.

225
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,730
For the past ten years,

226
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,510
countless geeks

227
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,370
wanted to find their footprints,

228
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,370
but they couldn't find anything.

229
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,550
So

230
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,200
if Mr. Gu wants to create an engine,

231
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,680
he has to have amazing support.

232
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,410
Non Human is the most suitable.

233
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,070
You...

234
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,540
Why don't you believe

235
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,500
that Mr. Gu can develop it himself?

236
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,440
Forget it.

237
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,030
I believe in him.

238
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,960
Let's continue.

239
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,450
You'd rather believe the group

240
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,220
that I've never seen before

241
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,750
than believe your boss.

242
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,690
It's locked.

243
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,950
Wudang Mountain?

244
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,780
No way.

245
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,170
Taoist temple?

246
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,600
He fooled us again?

247
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,280
So your subordinates are looking for you.

248
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,830
At the beginning of the system deployment,

249
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,520
I established

250
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,070
multiple identity verification.

251
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,110
I use a failure mode

252
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,440
to counteract multiple identity probes.

253
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,720
Bro,

254
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,950
I feel sorry for you.

255
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,110
After all, you used to be

256
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,470
the number one figure on the Internet.

257
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,870
Why are you so miserable?

258
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,270
No way.

259
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,770
I have to tell them

260
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,010
that Mr. Gu is the creator

261
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,260
of Non-human.

262
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,740
Go.

263
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm going.

264
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,670
I'm really going.

265
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,190
Good.

266
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,700
Why are you still here?

267
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,290
At a critical moment

268
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,110
for the company.

269
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,620
how can you still think about

270
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
getting off work?

271
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,700
No.

272
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,520
If I don't leave now,

273
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,900
I'll be late.

274
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,040
Dan, are you going home?

275
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,630
Yes.

276
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,630
Are you getting off work?

277
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,170
I'm going to the toilet.

278
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,100
Mr. Gu.

279
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,150
Don't ask too much

280
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,280
about girl issues.

281
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,550
Mouth, when you go back,

282
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,520
send me what

283
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,230
is done.

284
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,920
Alright.

285
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,410
Rest early.

286
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,790
Okay.

287
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,730
Go home.

288
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,150
Well...

289
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,470
Yes, neighbor?

290
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,950
I'm sorry about last time.

291
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,380
I shouldn't have

292
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,310
stereotypes about fields and professions

293
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,950
that I don't understand.

294
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,200
You didn't know, so you shouldn't be blamed.

295
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,280
A girl in my company

296
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,910
went in there for a long time.

297
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,400
Can you check it for me?

298
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,680
So you apologized to me

299
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,950
for something else.

300
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,990
No.

301
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,630
If I bother you,

302
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,070
I'll ask the property management for help.

303
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,510
It's okay. Just a moment.

304
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,740
Excuse me.

305
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,630
Are there any colleagues from Jiuqian here?

306
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,840
Your colleague

307
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,070
is worried about you.

308
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,040
I'm fine.

309
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,000
I just

310
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,520
feel unwell.

311
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,710
Please tell him.

312
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,630
Okay.

313
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,390
Thank you.

314
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,160
I heard everything.

315
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,510
Are you not feeling well?

316
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,070
I'm fine.

317
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,610
I can handle it myself.

318
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,970
Good evening, everyone.

319
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,230
I'm Dai

320
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,920
a siren live streamer

321
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,270
who conquers you

322
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,950
with voice and beauty.

323
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,980
I believe you all know

324
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,670
in the first 30 weeks of the competition,

325
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,240
I got

326
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,280
the entrance ticket for the Qixiu Grand Ceremony.

327
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,390
But I learned that

328
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,260
I'm going to battle Cute Mengmeng.

329
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,790
Compared to Cute Mengmeng,

330
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,830
I'm

331
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,090
just a nobody.

332
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,300
When I first knew,

333
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,450
I was very upset.

334
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,970
I wanted to quit.

335
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,190
But a friend

336
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,150
important to me

337
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,940
told me

338
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,950
that no matter how tiny a person is,

339
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,510
she can shine brightly.

340
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,570
"Unique Heartbeat",

341
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,400

I like someone else now.

353
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,390
Is it interesting to always sing easy songs?

354
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,720
How about hitting four octaves asl well?

355
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,470

Next,

I'll sing you

"Door", a song from "Rock it, Mom."

364
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,610
Rock is your weakness.

365
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,720

Today, whether it's your popularity

or the number of tips received,

378
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,070
both are approaching an all-time low.

379
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,470
You have to think of a way.

380
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,240
At this stage,

381
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,180
you are not

382
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,690
on the same level with her.

383
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,350
Dai?

384
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,810
Hello, I'm Cute Mengmeng.

385
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,390
Hello.

386
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,240
I heard

387
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,510
you're Qixiu's best streamer.

388
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,890
I'm flattered.

389
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,960
I'll re-evaluate

390
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,850
the standard of Qixiu's top star.

391
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,260
Don't be angry.

392
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,160
Dai.

393
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,850
You are the chosen one.

394
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,860
Take a leave if you're sick.

395
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,070
I've always opposed

396
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,270
working overtime without efficiency.

397
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,080
Okay.

398
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,080
Who is it? You actually replied to the message instantly?

399
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,470
I will follow your timeline.

400
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,240
I'll tutor you on Tuesday and Thursday after work.

401
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,250
Thank you, boss.

402
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,090
Is it Empresses in the Palace?

403
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,680
You're welcome.

404
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,510
This wine is not bad.

405
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,190
One more.

406
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,860
Actually, I'm not that unlucky.

407
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,540
At least,

408
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,580
there's a beautiful moon tonight.

409
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,490
You will win this game.

410
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,270
Come on.

411
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,260
Tell him...

412
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,190
Yuan.

413
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,620
OK.

414
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,680
Here you are.

415
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,530
Hello, who are you looking for?

416
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,310
Hello.

417
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,780
I am from the promotional company.

418
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,750
I'm looking for the streamer, Dai

419
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,610
to talk about the advertisement.

420
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,880
Are you Mr. Jia

421
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,840
Dai mentioned

422
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,980
before?

423
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,780
Yes.

424
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,870
It's me.

425
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,310
Unfortunately,

426
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,670
Dai is not here today.

427
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,620
No?

428
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,790
Give me her phone number.

429
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,920
I'll contact her myself.

430
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,800
Phone number?

431
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,720
Should I

432
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,230
give you her home address?

433
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,830
Sure.

434
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,980
Dai clearly states that

435
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,630
no ad implantation is allowed.

436
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,210
I don't think

437
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,140
you look like an advertiser.

438
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,950
You pretended to be an old classmate today

439
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,390
and tomorrow you'll pretend to be a courier.

440
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,720
You're quite creative.

441
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,200
The promotional company?

442
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,210
Aren't you leaving?

443
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,940
Do you want me to call security?

444
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,470
I've seen a lot of people like him.

445
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,430
Morning.

446
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,110
Jie.

447
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,030
Coffee. Do you want coffee?

448
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,070
Thank you.

449
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,870
In front of your company,

450
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,670
there are so many young ladies doing live streaming.

451
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,130
Gu didn't even watch them.

452
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,820
Why did he hire you?

453
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,440
Because they didn't apply for the job.

454
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,870
Guess again.

455
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,150
Because I'm meticulous

456
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,840
and patient.

457
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,510
Did he tell you that?

458
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,480
Only you

459
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,750
would believe it.

460
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,830
He never recruits girls,

461
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,710
except for Ms. Hu.

462
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,640
When he was at school,

463
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,710
many girls

464
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,740
blocked him

465
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,430
and asked him to help solve the problems.

466
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,830
He didn't want to talk to them.

467
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,550
But he volunteered to tutor you.

468
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,870
He's cold and mean,

469
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,430
but he's very protective of you.

470
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,770
Do you understand?

471
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,460
Yes.

472
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,050
What do you understand?

473
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,960
I'll work hard

474
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,610
and live up to Mr. Gu's expectations.

475
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,750
I'm speechless.

476
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,510
You and Gu Jiuli

477
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,210
are a good match.

478
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,120
Do I have to make it so clear?

479
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,310
Gu Jiuli

480
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,400
treats you differently.

481
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,000
So what are you going to do next?

482
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,690
Do you know?

483
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,830
How?

484
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,750
Marry him.

485
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,390
Just kidding.

486
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,090
He treats you well.

487
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,330
It's not too much for you

488
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,530
to treat him to a meal.

489
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,850
Mr. Gu is so busy.

490
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,520
Will he be available?

491
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,320
He's busy every day.

492
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,710
But he still helps you with your study.

493
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,310
Right?

494
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,390
Think about it.

495
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,150
Am I really that unique

496
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,710
to you?

497
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,950
If you don't want to go to the mountain,

498
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,950
I'll move the mountain towards you.

499
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,440
[Meeting Room 1]

500
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,310
Deal with this quickly.

501
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,790
The client will be here soon.

502
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,920
Remember to clean this place.

503
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,650
Okay, Yibai.

504
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,230
Candy.

505
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,640
Yibai, here are your documents.

506
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,570
Okay. Thank you.

507
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:52,890
Yongkang.

508
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,600
How long will it take?

509
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,330
Soon.

510
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,030
Okay.

511
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,930
Let me do it.

512
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,090
Okay.

513
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,110
Thank you, Yibai.

514
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,310
-You’re welcome.
-Yibai.

515
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,940
From now on, leave these things...

516
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,470
Mr. Gong.

517
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,070
To Yongkang and the others.

518
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,110
It's just a handy thing to do.

519
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,770
Yibai is eager to do anything.

520
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,680
She's much better than

521
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,430
us boys.

522
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,420
Yes.

523
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,270
Dazuo is really lucky.

524
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,500
How are his parents?

525
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,830
Is the wedding decided?

526
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,050
His parents went on a trip these days.

527
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,960
Well.

528
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,780
I've forced you to get married for so many years.

529
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,940
If you get married,

530
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,340
I'll miss you.

531
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,210
My Master Gong.

532
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,000
Don't worry about me.

533
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm fine.

534
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,720
Is the client coming?

535
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,030
Are the materials ready?

536
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,670
Yes.

537
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,630
Mr. Gong, Mr. Han is here.

538
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,270
What?

539
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,230
Do you know each other?

540
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,910
No.

541
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,710
This lady

542
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,290
looks like a friend of mine.

543
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,820
Okay.

544
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,150
Let me introduce.

545
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,470
Chen Yibai.

546
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,890
My PhD student.

547
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,190
She is also the person in charge of the LifeSource

548
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,710
Blue Pure Project.

549
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,030
Yibai.

550
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,560
This is Owen Han.

551
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,090
He's the Chinese representative

552
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,910
of the International Ocean,

553
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,860
a non-governmental organization.

554
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,660
He is also the supervisor of the Blue Pure Project.

555
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,490
Nice to meet you, Mr. Han.

556
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,310
Miss Chen, nice to meet you.

557
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,190
Miss Chen, do you

558
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,590
have other names?

559
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,760
For example?

560
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,630
Excuse me.

561
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,270
But you really look like her.

562
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:40,870
All right.

563
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,330
I'll go to the Municipal Education Commission for a meeting.

564
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,640
As for the project,

565
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,350
previously,

566
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,750
I've talked to

567
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,510
your chief manager.

568
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,710
As for the execution,

569
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,350
I'll leave it to you and Yibai.

570
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,790
Okay.

571
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,750
Yibai.

572
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,890
Owen

573
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,050
is a guest from afar.

574
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,310
Take good care of him.

575
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,970
Don't worry, Master Gong.

576
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,400
Mr. Han.

577
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,630
Please.

578
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,830
This is our plan.

579
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,520
Mr. Han, please have a look.

580
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,550
In order to communicate better,

581
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,630
let's add each other on WeChat.

582
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,420
Sorry.

583
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,510
I don't use WeChat.

584
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,280
Call me

585
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,710
if there's an emergency.

586
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,550
You have no WeChat account?

587
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,450
So you prefer

588
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,740
using a private message from Qixiu Live?

589
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,820
Dai?

590
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,510
You got the wrong person.

591
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,710
Wrong person?

592
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,680
What should I do?

593
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,640
How about I ask Master Gong?

594
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,880
What do you want?

595
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,950
Why?

596
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,430
What do you mean why?

597
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,730
Why did you ask me out

598
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,270
and block me?

599
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,510
You really got the wrong person.

600
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,840
I'm not Dai.

601
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,070
She's a friend of mine.

602
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,350
Lying.

603
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,950
Go on.

604
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,320
At this point,

605
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,230
what's the point of lying to you?

606
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,310
I just went to meet

607
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,390
a stupid and rich fan on behalf of her.

608
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,390
I admit that I'm rich.

609
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,400
But as to whether I'm stupid or not,

610
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,450
I think it requires

611
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,190
further understanding and communication

612
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,990
for us to know.

613
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,330
Let me ask Master Gong.

614
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,710
Happy cooperation, Yibai.

615
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,420
Sorry.

616
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,630
We're not that close.

617
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,750
If you don't mind,

618
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,550
you can call me Miss Chen.

619
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,470
What if I mind?

620
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,030
I see.

621
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,600
I read your information.

622
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,470
You are three years younger than me, aren't you?

623
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,950
If you really want to,

624
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,590
call me Senior Yibai.

625
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,480
I can accept that.

626
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,850
In your dreams.

627
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,950
I'll call you Yibai.

628
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,100
Yibai, Yibai, Yibai.

629
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,990
Let's start.

630
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,960
This is our proposal.

631
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,090
Mr. Han, take a look.

632
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,140
You mentioned

633
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,220
about raw materials.

634
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,740
I'll confirm with the supplier.

635
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,020
That’s all for today.

636
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,670
Thank you, Mr. Han.

637
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,710
I’m hungry.

638
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,670
I said I'm hungry.

639
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,150
Eat if you're hungry.

640
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,240
I think so too.

641
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,160
Let's go.

642
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,480
I have an appointment tonight.

643
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,870
Master Gong asked you

644
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,120
to take good care of me.

645
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,390
You're so familiar

646
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,790
with the city's dark cuisines.

647
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,380
I don't believe

648
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,110
you can leave yourself hungry.

649
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,870
Why are you in such a hurry?

650
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,000
Where're you going?

651
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,510
Feeling guilty?

652
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,670
Yibai.

653
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,320
Should I order food for you?

654
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,350
No, thanks.

655
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,910
Yibai said

656
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,210
to treat me to dinner.

657
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,420
Right, Yibai?

658
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Here, the paste-like soup noodles.

659
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,110
Do you have Chicken crown dumplings?

660
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,640
I’ve prepared them for you.

661
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,230
I asked Ma to add some white pepper for you

662
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,670
according to your preference.

663
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,400
Try it later.

664
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,030
Well,

665
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,560
actually,

666
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,850
Dai is my friend.

667
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:03,990
I know.

668
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,420
Dai

669
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,460
doesn't like your type.

670
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,170
What about you?

671
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,750
Do you like my type?

672
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,950
Are you crazy?

673
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,280
Judging from what you said,

674
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,570
you don't like me

675
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,300
or dislike me.

676
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,640
It seems that

677
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,070
I still have a big chance.

678
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,040
No matter who you are,

679
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,520
or what your name is,

680
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,810
it doesn't matter.

681
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,510
I'm sure the woman who can touch me

682
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,280
is someone who can sit here

683
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,810
and eat street food with me.

684
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,320
But I have a boyfriend.

685
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,270
You look cute when you lie.

686
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,230
Yibai.

687
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,590
Let me introduce.

688
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,270
This is my boyfriend, Dazuo.

689
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,030
Hello.

690
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,620
Han Yijie.

691
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,090
We're leaving.

692
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,830
Jie.

693
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,550
Are you a male mistress?

694
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,960
Your dish today

695
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,510
is a bit salty.

696
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,570
You haven't even eaten.

697
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,830
How do know it's salty?

698
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,330
Is there a problem at work?

699
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,510
No.

700
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,240
Was that

701
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,210
your client?

702
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,430
Yes.

703
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,860
When will your parents come back?

704
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,700
They'll be back in a few days.

705
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,710
What do they like?

706
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,540
So that I can prepare in advance.

707
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,830
Why didn't you answer it?

708
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,880
The realtor.

709
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,830
I accompanied Wang to view houses the other day.

710
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,930
He left my phone number

711
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,790
to the realtor.

712
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,750
They called me several times a day.

713
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,230
Yibai.

714
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,630
We...

715
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,720
Just say it.

716
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,240
What are we having for dinner?

717
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,890
Anything.

718
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,070
Should I treat him to dinner?

719
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,710
I don't think Jie

720
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,530
would have fooled me

721
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,280
like C did.

722
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,670
Should I say it now

723
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,150
or after it's over?

724
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,900
How should I put it naturally?

725
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,469
This question is about the infinitesimal calculus.

726
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,469
You must fully master

727
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,670
the various algorithms for infinitesimal calculus.

728
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,630
For example, limit arithmetic,

729
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,670
as well as L'Hôpital's rule.

730
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,510
Understand?

731
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,670
Actually,

732
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,270
it's not difficult to get more than 100 points

733
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,230
in a math exam.

734
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,600
Have some confidence in yourself.

735
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,460
So warm,

736
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,430
and considerate.

737
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,990
Is it really only

738
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,210
with me that you are like this?

739
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,390
Go on.

740
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,120
The same mistake

741
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,750
is made in all three of these questions.

742
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,280
Find the answer in the book.

743
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,170
Answer it.

744
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,670
Hello.

745
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,440
Hello, Ms. Hao.

746
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,880
This is Full Moon Restaurant.

747
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,700
Here's the thing.

748
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,980
You have reserved

749
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,420
a table for two at noon today.

750
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,680
Can you be here on time?

751
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,410
Okay, I got it.

752
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,320
Should I tell him?

753
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,840
I'll tell him when I count to three.

754
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,310
Three.

755
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,270
Two.

756
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,040
Go to the date.

757
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,090
Oh no.

758
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,320
He misunderstood.

759
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,280
I won the restaurant's free meal voucher.

760
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,800
For a table for two.

761
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,030
Do you want to go with me?

762
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,830
It's okay if you're not free.

763
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,610
I can eat two servings on my own.

764
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,140
Let's go.

765
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,450
This is the latest

766
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,080
online-famous restaurant.

767
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,670
Mr. Gu, don't worry.

768
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,750
We don't have to wait too long.

769
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,210
Hello.

770
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,370
Do you have a reservation?

771
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,530
No. B16.

772
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
My surname is Hao.

773
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,330
Miss Hao.

774
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,330
You reserved a table for two, right?

775
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,660
You have a reservation?

776
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,940
Oh no, I slipped out.

777
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,320
A free meal.

778
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,360
I've got the free meal voucher.

779
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,810
The restaurant...

780
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,210
The restaurant reserved the table for me.

781
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,950
Please follow me.

782
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,590
Please take a look at the menu.

783
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,280
Thank you.

784
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,000
Before the meal,

785
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,960
please allow me to introduce

786
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,140
our specialty.

787
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,380
Every customer

788
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,170
should cooperate with us

789
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,410
to complete a game.

790
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,760
There's a small task

791
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,930
in each bag.

792
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,680
As long as you complete it, you will be rewarded.

793
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,600
What game?

794
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,960
Just like them.

795
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,260
Please come closer.

796
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,550
What's going on?

797
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,370
I just want to have a meal

798
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,600
with Mr. Gu properly.

799
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,370
[Please help your companion tie her hair into a bun.]

800
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,160
How about we change...

801
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,890
You got the No. 19 draw.

802
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,140
The only No. 19 draw in our store.

803
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,520
You two are so lucky.

804
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,750
What does it require us to do?

805
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,550
Please help your companion tie her hair into a bun.

806
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,730
Bun.

807
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,910
Go for it!

808
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,360
Good luck.
