00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,970
[Episode 6]

4
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,350
Mr. Gu,

5
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,590
why don't you watch the video first?

6
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,870
It's okay now.

7
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,780
No.

8
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,770
It's not perfect enough.

9
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,730
I can tell

10
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,540
the gentleman is doing this the first time.

11
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,750
But it's not bad.

12
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,040
What do you think?

13
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,880
Good.

14
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,270
I think it's good too.

15
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Then

16
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,590
let's take a photo

17
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,430
as a souvenir.

18
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,110
Smile. Smile.

19
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,260
Good. Get closer.

20
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,840
Three, two, one.

21
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,670
I want this.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Okay.

23
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,329
And this.

24
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

25
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,990
Thank you.

26
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,990
We have another event today.

27
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,880
Another event?

28
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,610
What's the matter?

29
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,829
N-Nothing.

30
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,579
Simply share the QR code

31
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,470
on the back of the menu

32
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,400
on Moments

33
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,890
and collect 100 likes,

34
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,350
then you can get our restaurant's signature dish,

35
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,270
Fiery Hot Chicken Drumsticks.

36
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,900
Is it the one

37
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,300
recommended by gourmet Jennifer in her column?

38
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,940
Yes.

39
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,180
But he doesn't eat spicy food.

40
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,010
Order what you want.

41
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,150
Forget it.

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,830
We're not going to participate.

43
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,950
I'm afraid I won't be able to

44
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,079
collect such many likes in my Moments.

45
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,279
Can we just order one directly?

46
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,390
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,130
Fiery Hot Chicken Drumsticks can't be sold individually.

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,800
I need to use the restroom.

49
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,000
How is it?

50
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,070
It looks nice.

51
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,600
It makes the skin look fair.

52
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:37,950
Look.

53
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,090
What's wrong with the girls nowadays?

54
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,020
Exactly. She didn't even fix it up.

55
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,030
Gu Jiuli treats you differently.

56
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,870
It's really ugly.

57
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,600
But I like it.

58
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,040
Here's your mushroom soup. Please enjoy.

59
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,390
This is…

60
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,510
There are many people in my Moments.

61
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,840
I got 100 likes quickly.

62
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

63
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,730
Did I give you any trouble?

64
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,470
I… I saw the posts on your Moments

65
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,110
are all about work.

66
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,090
Sometimes I post something else too.

67
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

68
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,590
Hello.

69
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,680
Hello, Mr. Gu.

70
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,710
Did your WeChat account get hacked?

71
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,590
No.

72
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:35,960
You finally picked up the call.

73
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,760
Where are you?

74
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,440
What's the matter?

75
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,140
Mr. Gu tutored you today.

76
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,960
Has any other woman

77
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
come to see Mr. Gu?

78
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,430
N-No.

79
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,380
No?

80
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,800
That's weird then.

81
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Really.

82
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,580
Look at your Moments.

83
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,880
I said no.

84
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,310
Well. You wrote that post

85
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,710
on your Moments just now?

86
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,800
Yes, I did.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,420
Mr. Gu never eats spicy food.

88
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,330
Why did he suddenly ask for likes

89
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,170
and order spicy chicken drumsticks?

90
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,070
Don't you think it's weird?

91
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,730
There was no sign of it before.

92
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,150
Who would it be?

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,690
For me.

94
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,040
It wouldn't be an investor, would it?

95
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,300
Do you think it would be for the investor?

96
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,030
Are you listening?

97
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,230
Never mind. I'll stop talking to you.

98
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,360
It's just wasting my breath. Bye-bye.

99
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,830
I won't tell you

100
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,470
Mr. Gu ordered it especially for me.

101
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,680
Anything else you want to say?

102
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,310
Mr. Gu,

103
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,640
if you're kidnapped,

104
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,550
just cough.

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,170
I'll come to save you immediately.

106
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,610
Boring. I'm hanging up.

107
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,710
Was that C?

108
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,159
What did he say?

109
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,220
You can't talk about it?

110
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,340
I can.

111
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,010
He said your post on Moments

112
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,030
must be for a woman.

113
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,750
He asked me if I know who it is.

114
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,450
So boring.

115
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,040
It's so spicy, but it's so delicious.

116
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,230
Mr. Gu, do you want to have a try?

117
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,650
You're exactly like my dad.

118
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,510
He doesn't eat any spicy food either.

119
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,720
He cares very much about nurturing his health.

120
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,070
He also says the food I eat is too spicy

121
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,270
and it's not healthy.

122
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,660
Mr. Gu, I forgot to tell you.

123
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,960
T-This spicy taste

124
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,630
has a strong delayed effect.

125
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,810
Mr. Gu,

126
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,150
do you have something urgent?

127
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,030
If you have something urgent, please go ahead.

128
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,430
I'll eat for a bit longer.

129
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,690
Aren't you full yet?

130
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,160
No, no, no.

131
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,580
I'm full.

132
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,760
How can I pay the bill if you don't leave?

133
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,890
Hello.

134
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,840
Here's the photo

135
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,130
we took of you just now.

136
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,020
Thank you.

137
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,720
Excuse me.

138
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,340
Is there anything else you would like to order?

139
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,730
Then are you going to pay the bill now?

140
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,400
Please give me a takeout box.

141
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,240
T-Takeout…

142
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:58,830
I'll go.

143
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,650
Hello, sir.

144
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,670
This way, please.

145
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,350
Mr. Gu.

146
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,400
Sorry.

147
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,980
It was my first time doing a girl's hair.

148
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,730
It seemed like a failure.

149
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,150
No, it looks nice.

150
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,270
Well,

151
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,030
I lied to you

152
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,720
about the dine and dash.

153
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,390
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,590
You especially made a reservation?

155
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,520
I wanted to treat you to a meal

156
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,140
to express my appreciation.

157
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,420
But I didn't know how to ask you.

158
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,730
Next time, you can tell me directly.

159
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,340
May I?

160
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,530
Of course.

161
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,340
He said "next time."

162
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,110
Does that mean

163
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,230
I can ask him out to dinner often?

164
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,150
Is he…

165
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,470
No, no, no.

166
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,040
Hao Liang, don't get excited by yourself.

167
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,100
Maybe he treats you

168
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,320
with just the same kind of care that leaders treat their subordinates

169
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,510
and elders treat their juniors.

170
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,600
But

171
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,280
it feels really good.

172
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,710
Are you not feeling well?

173
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,020
It's too spicy.

174
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,860
You'd better seldom eat it in the future.

175
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
It's not healthy.

176
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,770
Let's go.

177
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,350
Mr. Gu,

178
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,590
how much is this meal?

179
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,790
Let's split the bill.

180
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,900
Bottoms up.

181
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
Don't think too much.

182
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,630
You're drinking alone?

183
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,650
She actually has a boyfriend.

184
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,740
That man,

185
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,090
the more I look at him, the worse he gets.

186
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,600
I wonder

187
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,020
what she likes about him.

188
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,560
Then give up.

189
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,800
No.

190
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,600
I must pursue and get her

191
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,200
and save her from trouble.

192
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Wish you success.

193
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,520
You look happy.

194
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,400
Is it because

195
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,170
you had dinner with Hao Liang?

196
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,700
You don't even say "Thank you?"

197
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,690
If it weren't my assistance,

198
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,220
would she have invited you?

199
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,560
Wait a second.

200
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,620
What happened to your mouth?

201
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Why is it swollen?

202
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,280
You finally gave your first kiss to someone?

203
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,270
Wait.

204
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,440
You got her?

205
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,590
Shut up.

206
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,810
I had spicy food at noon.

207
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,150
I don't understand

208
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,720
why so many people

209
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,650
like spicy food?

210
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,950
Staying up late. Hard-core. Gossip.

211
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,210
The three signatures of we young people.

212
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,110
I stay up late too.

213
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,360
And the next morning,

214
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,820
you go jogging at 5:30.

215
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,390
Right?

216
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,980
This only shows that you're old

217
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,360
and sleep very little.

218
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,140
Alright.

219
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,590
If you have time to mind my business,

220
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,330
why don't you deal with your little influencer first?

221
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,730
Just wait and you'll see.

222
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,590
Alright, alright. Where are you going?

223
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,250
Just talk here. Where are you…

224
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,640
Don't rush.

225
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,310
What are you doing? So mysterious.

226
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,320
Stop pulling me.

227
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,470
What's wrong?

228
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,270
Does Hao Liang have a boyfriend?

229
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,650
Why do you ask about it?

230
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,250
Tell me.

231
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,810
I don't know. I have no idea.

232
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,720
I don't like her.

233
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,580
I'm asking about it for Gu.

234
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,710
For Gu?

235
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,910
Don't you think Gu treats Hao Liang

236
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,170
a little differently?

237
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,180
Mr. Gu has always been nice to his subordinates.

238
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,830
How long have you been working with Gu?

239
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,710
About six years.

240
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,440
Six years.

241
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,990
In the past six years,

242
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,120
has he ever paid such attention

243
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,850
to any woman?

244
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,870
Well…

245
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,910
He wrote less than ten posts

246
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,040
in his Moments in a year,

247
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,270
and they were all about work.

248
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,070
But yesterday

249
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,800
he especially wrote a post for Hao Liang

250
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,470
to collect likes on his Moments.

251
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,430
Understand now?

252
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,440
That's it.

253
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,970
I thought

254
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,070
Mr. Gu's account got hacked.

255
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,860
So,

256
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,090
I think

257
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,110
Gu has fallen in love with Hao Liang.

258
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,830
Right?

259
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,050
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

260
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,570
No.

261
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,450
I'll treat you.

262
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
Let's make a plan.

263
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,810
Mr. Gu,

264
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,260
your taste is so weird.

265
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,680
Do you really like Hao Liang?

266
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,020
Calm down.

267
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,720
This can't be a misunderstanding.

268
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,960
But

269
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,630
I really want Mr. Gu

270
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,380
to like me.

271
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,630
Come in.

272
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,560
Dai.

273
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,750
Here's the drink for you.

274
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,350
By the way,

275
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,800
recently the boss said that he encourages streamers

276
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,790
to connect and compete with each other

277
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,980
during livestreaming so as to increase the click rate.

278
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,710
Have you decided who to choose?

279
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,270
Of course the strongest one.

280
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,210
You mean Cute Mengmeng?

281
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,710
Oh my god.

282
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,290
Break a leg!

283
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,730
I have faith in you.

284
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,620
Thank you.

285
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,150
Bye-bye.

286
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,230
♫I've decided to hold your hand♫

287
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,510
♫And travel around the world♫

288
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,200
♫Look up and catch the stars♫

289
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,510
♫Make a wish♫

290
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,540
♫Maybe love♫

291
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,280
♫Is a life lesson♫

292
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,280
♫Maybe I am the one♫

293
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,160
♫You're meant to be with in your life♫

294
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,180
Thank you all for your support.

295
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,660
Thank you very much.

296
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,140
Ignore her.

297
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,930
Don't reply

298
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,660
no matter what she says.

299
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,460
Do you hear me?

300
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,800
Hi, Cute Mengmeng.

301
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,910
We meet again.

302
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,840
Good evening, Dai.

303
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,890
What do you want to play today?

304
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,790
For the livestreaming on Thursday,

305
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,410
let's compete on the click rate.

306
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,760
The loser will receive a punishment.

307
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,470
Thursday

308
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,150
is not my livestreaming day.

309
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,790
What?

310
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,970
Are you scared?

311
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,780
For you,

312
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,310
I'll be on standby.

313
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,470
Good.

314
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,589
In the next few days,

315
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,050
think about the song then.

316
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,190
Instead, I should think about

317
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,670
what punishment I can give you.

318
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,510
Well.

319
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,300
Let's wait and see then.

320
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,349
You got brave.

321
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,839
On Thursday evening,

322
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,460
everyone, remember to come and watch.

323
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,730
I'll sing a song called "Don't Be So Proud"

324
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,530
for everyone.

325
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,110
Dan, Dan.

326
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,490
Give me a hand. It's an emergency.

327
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,480
You're not asking me

328
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,670
to pretend to be your girlfriend again, are you?

329
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,670
Just stand beside me

330
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,230
like last time.

331
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,190
You don't need to talk.

332
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,720
Let's go.

333
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,990
No!

334
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,000
Last time. This is the last time.

335
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Let's go.

336
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,360
I can't help you do something like this

337
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,130
in the future anymore.

338
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,070
Why?

339
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,080
I just won't help you anyway.

340
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,340
What's wrong with you?

341
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,840
Why are you different from before?

342
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,590
I…

343
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,710
I've got a crush on someone.

344
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,560
I know.

345
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,560
Your idol…

346
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,380
No.

347
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,760
Really?

348
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,280
Who is it?

349
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,530
Is it Fatty Li from your class?

350
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,340
Or the underclassman

351
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,870
who is new to the basketball team?

352
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,720
The debt of love

353
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,670
is something you have to face on your own.

354
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,270
Good luck!

355
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,520
Dan. Dan.

356
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,000
Who are you?

357
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,680
How could you break into the girls' dorm?

358
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,810
Aunt Meili. It's me.

359
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,680
Dan, you're back…

360
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,210
What's wrong with you?

361
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,550
Dan.

362
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,920
Dan, please help me, just once.

363
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,110
Dan.

364
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,350
Who? Who is it?

365
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,360
Dan, come out.

366
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,320
Please. Please.

367
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,350
Dan, please help me once.

368
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,960
Who is it?

369
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,930
Where's Dan?

370
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,280
She's not here.

371
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,000
She's not here. Not here.

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,460
Come on.

373
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,370
What are you doing?

374
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:00,900
Nothing.

375
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,080
What do you mean?

376
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,770
Who are you?

377
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,550
Dan.

378
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,070
Step aside.

379
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,780
No!

380
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,750
Dan. Dan.

381
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,120
Zhu Yi.

382
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,710
Just help…

383
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,570
She's not here.

384
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,610
Help me.

385
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,310
Just once.

386
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,750
You owe me a favor.

387
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,930
Alright. Alright.

388
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,930
You…

389
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,800
Yuner.

390
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,290
Actually,

391
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,600
I've been with Panpan for a long time.

392
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,240
So I won't get together with you.

393
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:28,880
I can't believe

394
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,570
you got together

395
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,200
with such a scheming person.

396
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,130
Don't you feel sorry for me, Zhu Yi?

397
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,190
A scheming person?

398
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,830
Me?

399
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,010
Thank you for your compliment.

400
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,440
Zhu,

401
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,880
I told you

402
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,030
not to tell her.

403
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,590
Someone will have to be broken-hearted

404
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,440
this way.

405
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,820
Since someone has to be broken-hearted,

406
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,390
I'll quit then.

407
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,460
No.

408
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,670
You cheating couple!

409
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,420
Let go.

410
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,710
Move.

411
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,250
Thank you. I'm leaving then.

412
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,830
You can be considered

413
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,290
the campus king

414
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,380
of our school.

415
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,330
But

416
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,470
you're not even close to

417
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,530
being worthy of me.

418
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,200
What do you mean?

419
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,030
You come to our dorm almost every day

420
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,030
in the name of looking for Hao Liang.

421
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,380
Do you think I'm stupid?

422
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,710
You didn't think I like you, did you?

423
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,440
Don't worry.

424
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,730
I definitely will not

425
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,480
let anyone else know

426
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,310
that I refused you today.

427
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,840
Bye-bye.

428
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,230
Yang Panpan.

429
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,830
Is he gone?

430
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,000
I drove away your male confidant

431
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,520
and also helped him get rid of his girlfriend.

432
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,650
That's impressive.

433
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,520
Of course.

434
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,430
Panpan.

435
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,150
You're so wonderful.

436
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,130
How do you find out

437
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,930
that boys like you?

438
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,280
"Like"

439
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,320
is a very general concept.

440
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,550
How should I put it?

441
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,100
A boy from the Department of Energy Studies

442
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,880
likes me very much.

443
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,800
He's a game fanatic.

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,910
During the final stretch of the competition season,

445
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,080
he blew off his teammates

446
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,430
and didn't go to Kings Canyon.

447
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,760
Instead, he went to Crazy Happy Valley

448
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,820
with me.

449
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,970
What is this?

450
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,720
If I like you,

451
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,670
I'll break the convention for you.

452
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,440
I'm here to get a job.

453
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,140
We don't hire girls

454
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,610
for the position of micro-expression collector.

455
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,610
Give her a chance.

456
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,310
Rules are rules.

457
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,050
Congratulations.

458
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,110
You've been hired.

459
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,850
What else? What else?

460
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,890
Do you see this?

461
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,230
Indigowoad root granules.

462
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,590
Last time when I had a phone call with the boy

463
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,200
from the Department of Energy Studies,

464
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,790
he heard I had a stuffy nose.

465
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,450
The next day, he brought the medicine

466
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,800
to my classroom door and gave it to me.

467
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,530
What is this?

468
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,040
Liking a person silently and putting it into action.

469
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,250
Understand?

470
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,990
You should thank Mr. Gu

471
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,190
for the holiday gift.

472
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,540
This water bottle

473
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,690
was specially chosen by Mr. Gu

474
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,750
to take care of you.

475
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,900
I said that the air conditioner

476
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,760
in our building

477
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,930
was so strong and dry

478
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,910
that it made you constipated.

479
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,770
Mr. Gu heard it and took it in then.

480
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,000
Though Mr. Gu

481
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,220
didn't want to hire you before,

482
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,680
he really takes care of you

483
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,870
after hiring you.

484
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,640
Well…

485
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,470
Anything else?

486
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,540
Dan,

487
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,370
you're so curious.

488
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,870
Since you're so eager

489
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,130
to know about it today…

490
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,160
This one.

491
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,590
It's such a thick notebook of notes

492
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,390
for the Principles of Pedagogy.

493
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,960
The boy from the Department of Mechanical Engineering

494
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,160
spent the whole semester copying it for me.

495
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,570
The whole semester.

496
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,550
He spent it on doing something for me.

497
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,280
What is this?

498
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,840
Paying the time cost

499
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,600
and liking someone sincerely.

500
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,000
This problem

501
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,810
is about the indeterminate form of limit.

502
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,720
You must fully master different kinds of arithmetic

503
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,500
of the indeterminate form of limits.

504
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
For example,

505
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,110
the four arithmetic operations of limits

506
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,370
and L'Hôpital's rule.

507
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,110
Anything else?

508
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,200
I… Let me put it this way.

509
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,170
In summary,

510
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,670
what is "like?"

511
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,440
It is… Dan,

512
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,050
if you're the last withered blade of grass

513
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,460
in this world,

514
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,120
in the eyes of the person who likes you,

515
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,280
you'll still be the best treasure

516
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
in the world.

517
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,310
What's important is that I hired you.

518
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,910
So,

519
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,510
you are the one

520
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,480
who is the most suitable.

521
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,720
Many people know the rights and wrongs,

522
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,730
but they can't behave accordingly.

523
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,590
However, you're in the minority.

524
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,640
So, he…

525
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,110
He really likes…

526
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,920
Dan.

527
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,470
You.

528
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,480
It's…

529
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,810
It's that friend of mine.

530
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,690
The one I told you about last time.

531
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,820
Do you know

532
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,650
you can't lie at all?

533
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,660
Look at your face.

534
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,790
Look how distorted it is.

535
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,920
Why are you nervous?

536
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,150
Is it you?

537
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,700
Fine, it is me.

538
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,030
It is you.

539
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,510
Who is it?

540
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,530
Who is it? We've talked for so long. Who is it?

541
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,560
M-My boss.

542
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Your boss?

543
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,790
A greasy middle-aged man?

544
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,760
No, he's handsome.

545
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
A handsome greasy middle-aged man?

546
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,010
I'm going to take a shower.

547
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,880
Dan. Dan.

548
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,010
I was just kidding.

549
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,600
Just kidding.

550
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,460
Don't be angry.

551
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,060
No matter who we like,

552
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,070
just go for him if we like him.

553
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,100
But…

554
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,630
Stop.

555
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,630
I knew you would say "but."

556
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,070
Dan, you little coward.

557
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,060
"Like" is very important.

558
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,270
There are two plans.

559
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,950
Plan No. 1,

560
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,600
you launch a love offense tomorrow.

561
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,200
Plan No. 2,

562
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,350
I'll go to your company,

563
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,140
play the gong and drum downstairs,

564
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,890
and let everyone know

565
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,950
you like your boss.

566
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,910
Panpan.

567
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,520
Pick one.

568
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,420
It's very easy for a woman to pursue a man.

569
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,750
Everything matches with the symptoms of love.

570
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,480
What are you hesitating about?

571
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,850
Never mind. Forget it.

572
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,640
He has illuminated my life so much already.

573
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm very happy.

574
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,270
Wake up, Dan.

575
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,100
It's 2021.

576
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,680
If you don't pull up the good radish,

577
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,500
someone will pull it up and take it away tomorrow.

578
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,160
Silly girl.

579
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:03,860
Don't worry.

580
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,280
I'll help you.

581
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,070
The first step to pursue a man: the trick of torturing yourself.

582
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,950
Show your weakness in front of him

583
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,320
to stimulate his desire to protect you.

584
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,860
Why isn't he here yet?

585
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,440
C said

586
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,670
he won't drive these days.

587
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,150
Okay, I got it.

588
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,680
Mr. Gu.

589
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,360
Call me Jiuli.

590
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,690
May I?

591
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,220
Of course.

592
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,360
Who are you?

593
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,790
Are you an employee in our building?

594
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,870
I've been observing you for a while.

595
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,420
Why are you sneaking around?

596
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,620
What do you want to do?

597
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,300
Shouldn't it be

598
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,640
falling into his arms?

599
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,170
Alright, you may go in.

600
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,430
Thank you.

601
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,420
Liang, you look so pretty today.

602
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,610
Come to my office.

603
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,040
Mr. Gu, you wanted to see me?

604
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,070
Thank you.

605
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,600
I sent a gift on your behalf.

606
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,340
No need to thank me.

607
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,340
How could Panpan take the liberty of doing this?

608
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,760
It's so embarrassing.

609
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,590
You forgot that you sent it?

610
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,210
[Hope you will like it]

611
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,890
And it's handmade.

612
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,310
Actually…

613
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,180
It doesn't taste good?

614
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,610
It's peanut flavored?

615
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,270
You don't like peanut flavor?

616
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,030
Not bad.

617
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,610
It's good that you like it.

618
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,210
Thank you.

619
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,870
Look. Do you think this is a whorl

620
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,170
or a loop?

621
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,620
I think this is a woman.

622
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,150
Who?

623
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,910
It must be an acquaintance who did it.

624
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,710
It was so accurate and ruthless.

625
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,090
It seems to be an enemy.

626
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,600
What's wrong with Mr. Gu?

627
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,570
I don't know who gave him

628
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,800
some peanut brittle, but he ate it

629
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,950
and had a peanut allergy,

630
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,280
and he went to hospital.

631
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,020
What do you mean by "Ah?"

632
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,400
It's peanut flavored?

633
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,060
You don't like peanut flavor?

634
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,010
Not bad.

635
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,840
"Ah" means

636
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,350
why would someone be allergic to peanuts?

637
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,150
Come on.

638
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,870
It's very common to be allergic to peanuts.

639
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,360
OK?

640
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,890
But if the allergy

641
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,430
is in the airway,

642
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,010
then it would be…

643
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,620
Mr. Gu was weird too.

644
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,670
He's allergic to peanuts.

645
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,200
Then why did he still eat it?

646
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,470
Right.

647
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,770
I think

648
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,630
Mr. Gu couldn't refuse the offer from a beauty, so he had to eat it.

649
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,430
You mean

650
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,270
a woman did it?

651
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,760
Do you think a man did it?

652
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,940
Y-You…

653
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,820
Why are you looking at me?

654
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,410
Tell us.

655
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,720
Did you do this

656
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,270
to Mr. Gu?

657
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,870
Your hand. Give me your hand.

658
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,660
Mr. Gu is not here,

659
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,720
so all of you are not working anymore?

660
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,040
This document is for Mr. Gu to sign.

661
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,100
Are you available?

662
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,610
Are you available?

663
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,670
Mr. Gu just told me

664
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,800
that he took the medicine and slept.

665
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,910
Just enter the password

666
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,570
and leave the document there.

667
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,020
Miss,

668
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,900
do you need help?

669
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,660
No.

670
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,280
I… I come here to deliver the document

671
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,000
to my boss.

672
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:28,950
Okay.

673
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,630
Miss,

674
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,590
what room are you looking for?

675
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,690
Okay.

676
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,170
If you don't tell the truth,

677
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,750
I'll call the security.

678
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,600
Don't. Don't.

679
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,800
Don't get me wrong, please.

680
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,920
I… I'll go in.

681
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,950
I'll go in now.

682
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,200
Miss.

683
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,080
If you don't tell the truth,

684
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,620
I'm really going to call the police.

685
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,500
No.

686
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,540
Auntie,

687
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,430
I… I'm really here

688
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,480
to see my boss.

689
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,800
I entered the wrong password just now.

690
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,370
Come in.

691
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,840
Door is closed.

692
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,080
Mr. Gu.

693
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,190
Mr. Fei has a document

694
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,050
for you to sign.

695
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,620
Sorry.

696
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,480
I didn't know you're allergic to peanuts.

697
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,860
It's fine.

698
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,420
Then,

699
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,940
are you still feeling unwell?

700
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,320
Do you need to go to hospital?

701
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,230
No.

702
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,420
I feel much better.

703
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,560
Your milk tea.

704
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,510
Thank you.

705
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,520
Let me get you some water.

706
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,600
N-No, thanks.

707
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,950
I'll go back now.

708
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,950
Okay. Stay safe.

709
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,400
Let me do it.

710
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,940
How many times did you enter the password?

711
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,719
I entered it twice.

712
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,750
Three times.

713
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,480
Maybe…

714
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,409
Maybe four or five times.

715
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,199
I'll look for the spare key.

716
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,040
Mr. Gu,

717
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,240
are they your parents?

718
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,080
Yes.

719
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,540
It's so amazing.

720
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,560
Obviously it's the same person

721
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,950
but with two different temperaments.

722
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,630
Is there any difference?

723
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,740
You are more mature now.

724
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,020
You're saying I'm old?

725
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,520
No.

726
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,160
Do you live with them?

727
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,640
They passed away ten years ago.

728
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,330
You don't have to take it to heart.

729
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,860
Mr. Gu, I'm sorry.

730
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,260
I can't find the key.

731
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,130
Call and report it for repair.

732
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,550
Come and sit.

733
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,910
You can take off your bag.

734
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,700
Before,

735
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,990
I thought Mr. Gu looks peerless

736
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,550
in a suit.

737
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,480
I didn't expect

738
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,190
he's even more handsome

739
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,830
in loungewear.

740
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,510
Gu Jiuli,

741
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,120
you are strikingly handsome.

742
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,990
If you feel bored,

743
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,270
you can watch TV.

744
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,280
Okay.

745
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,630
Is it funny?

746
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,990
I… I laughed?

747
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,030
You laughed just now.

748
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,830
Really?

749
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,100
He looked at me.

750
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,870
He's peeking at me.

751
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,430
Oh no.

752
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,280
I want to go to the bathroom.

753
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,730
But

754
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,790
it's so awkward to go to the bathroom

755
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,350
in the boss' place.

756
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,480
Isn't this funny?

757
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,850
But I'm in an urgent situation now.

758
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,580
I really can't laugh.
