00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,780
Don't be nervous.

You can't even walk.

You look exquisite.

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,480
What did you prepare?

10
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,470
It'll surely be satisfying.

11
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,500
Mr. Gu,

12
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,480
I have something to tell you.

13
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,460
What is it?

14
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,960
Well,

15
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,590
I didn't expect it earlier.

16
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,990
It happened so suddenly

17
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,990
that I couldn't remind you earlier.

18
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,240

20
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,810
Good for you, Gu.

21
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,120
Your future mother-in-law

23
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,100
She's very sincere.

29
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,890

Anyway,

38
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,890
good luck.

39

40
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,240

Hello, Ms. Song.

59
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,810
I'm a good friend of Yibai,

60

like them.

61
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,730
Since you are all good friends,

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,500
you don't have to be so polite.

63
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,170
Have a seat.

64
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,000
The meal will be ready soon.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,800
Wait a minute.

66
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,120
Okay.

67
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,930
Chen Yibai's kitchen

68
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,450

69
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,050
I made some homemade dishes.

70
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,210

Okay, Ms. Song.

73
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,570
I won't be too polite to refuse, then.

74

Don't be.

75
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,650
Mom, did you

76
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,240
forget to taste it again?

77
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,690
Do I need to?

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,290
At my level,

79
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,110

84
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,680
Han,

85
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,950
is the chicken delicious?

86
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,490
Yes.

87
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,280
I specially improved the recipe

88
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,350
by replacing the seasoning like salt, oil, soy sauce, and vinegar

89
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,810
with the original taste of the chicken soup.

90
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,130
This way, the original nutrition of the chicken

91
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,280
can be maintained as much as possible.

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,960
Come on, everyone, have a try, please.

95
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,690
No way. You have some.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,630
It's good.

97
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,660
Good.

99

100
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,730
Fine, you can really endure.

101
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,890

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,350
Ms. Song didn't cook well.

105
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,280
I don't think so.

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,050

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,280
No, no, no.

108
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,190

113

in the simplest way.

114
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,990
The way Ms. Song cooked

115
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,000
not only maintained the nutrition of the food,

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,130
but also guaranteed

117
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,250
the tastiness that the food should have.

118
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:07,850
So,

119
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,620
thank you, Ms. Song.

120

Don't call me Ms. Song.

122

136
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,210
Is that a gas mask?

137
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:03,880
No.

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,930
[Certification of the Bachelor's Degree from Tsinghua University]

196
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,880
and master's degree at Stanford?

197
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,610
Yes.

198
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,620
Your educational background

199
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,610
is a good match for Dan's.

200
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,380
Match my foot!

201
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,690
He has an overwhelming superiority.

202
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,480
You were born on April 25,

203
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,240
1990.

204
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,100
You're ten years older than Dan?

205
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,050
Yes.

206
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:48,950
Auntie,

207
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,850
I am

208
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,800
a little older than Hao Liang.

209
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,250
I'm sorry about that.

210
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,060
But don't worry.

211
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,310
From now on,

212
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,290
I will eat healthy food

213
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,110
to prolong my life.

214
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,130
I will also exercise hard

215
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,290
and rest regularly.

216
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,890
I'll try to

217
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,820
die later than Hao Liang

218
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,130
and take care of her when she's old.

219
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,330
Gu Jiuli,

220
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,200
you may really

221
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,260
have to work hard.

222
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,500
The Hao family has longevity genes.

223
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,860
Hao Liang's great-grandma

224
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,730
is 105 years old.

225
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,940
Then I'll try

226
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,550
to live to be 106 years old.

227
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,440
Good.

228
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,330
Very good.

229
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,570
What I regret the most

230
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,010
is that my husband

231
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,040
was four years younger than me.

232
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,290
In life,

233
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,670
I had to take care of him in every aspect.

234
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,570
Luckily,

235
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,290
Dan

236
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,810
won't meet the same fate

237
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,970
as me again.

238
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,330
Very good.

239
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,280
Gu.

240
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,290
Not bad.

241
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,530
Very good.

242
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,360
Mom.

243
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,510
How old are you?

244
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,060
You still can't dry your hair?

245
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,820
When you get old,

246
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,220
you'll get a migraine.

247
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,980
No.

248
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
I always dried it.

249
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,280
Dan.

250
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,280
I…

251
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,490
I don't want you to leave me.

252
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,860
Mom.

253
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,440
However,

254
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,120
Gu

255
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,410
is not bad.

256
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,930
He's honest.

257
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,610
He doesn't lie or play tricks.

258
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,570
He's older

259
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,210
and good at taking care of others.

260
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,290
Get along well with him.

261
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,980
Don't be childish.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,720
What are you talking about?

263
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,800
You sound like I'm going to marry

264
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,810
tomorrow.

265
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,030
You've grown up in the blink of an eye.

266
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,970
I remember…

267
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,520
I remember you

268
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,450
when you first became my daughter.

269
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,000
You were only this big.

270
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,210
Your small nose

271
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,730
was flat.

272
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,340
It's still kinda flat now.

273
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,530
You're still like a child.

274
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,440
I really don't want you to

275
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
get married so early.

276
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,890
Mom,

277
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,090
it's still up in the air.

278
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,360
No way.

279
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
Don't give me the whole

280
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,970
"All romance, no marriage" thing.

281
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,720
That's not allowed.

282
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,680
Absolutely not.

283
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,010
No.

284
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,280
Dating

285
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,530
is for the purpose of getting married.

286
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,270
Understand?

287
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,890
Okay.

288
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,160
Do you know how old you are?

289
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,800
I...

290
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm only in my early twenties.

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,530
Only in the early twenties?

292
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,900
In a few years,

293
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,610
you'll hit the age of late marriage and late childbearing.

294
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,540
Do you have a sense of crisis or not?

295
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,210
Yes.

296
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,370
Dan,

297
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,410
I…

298
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,370
I really don't want you to leave me.

299
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,160
If...

300
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,600
If Gu treats you badly

301
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,960
or bullies you,

302
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,850
just come home.

303
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,750
My home

304
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
will always be your home.

305
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,890
Mom, stop talking about this.

306
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,730
Hold me to sleep,

307
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,000
just like what you did when I was young.

308
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,250
You must be well.

309
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,330
You must be well.

310
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,370
Are you sure

311
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,810
you're quitting the Qixiu Grand Ceremony?

312
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,060
Auntie,

313
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
do you like Shanghai?

314
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,840
Yes.

315
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,390
The last time we came to Shanghai for a trip

316
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,170
was years ago.

317
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,880
I remember Dan

318
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,970
was only ten years old.

319
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,300
Do you remember it, Dan?

320
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,230
Here, eat.

321
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,200
Okay, Cousin.

322
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:55,730
Eat.

323
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,120
Eat.

324
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,160
Auntie, stay for a few more days.

325
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,480
We'll show you around.

326
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,520
No need.

327
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,760
You are all busy.

328
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,980
Don't worry about me.

329
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,410
Here, eat this.

330
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,370
Did Mr. Niu contact you?

331
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
You know what I'm talking about.

332
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,920
It's meaningless

333
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,640
to discuss it now.

334
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,410
I've decided not to go.

335
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,770
Is it

336
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,700
that you don't want to go

337
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,020
or that you dare not?

338
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,840
Is it because of your mother?

339
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,090
Yes.

340
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
My mom doesn't

341
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,750
come to Shanghai often.

342
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,990
I want to show her around.

343
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:12,970
Liar.

344
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,290
You promised me

345
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,310
that no matter what I did,

346
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,830
you would support me.

347
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,750
What I support

348
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,080
is what you want to do,

349
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,110
not what you run away from.

350
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,320
Hao Liang,

351
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,970
you're different now.

352
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,780
Not only do you have me,

353
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,280
but you also have Han Yijie, Chen Yibai,

354
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,610
and many fans who support you.

355
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Of course, the most important thing

356
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,300
is that your mother

357
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
is not your enemy.

358
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,760
She doesn't want you to go

359
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,620
because she loves you.

360
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,540
So now,

361
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,160
the only enemy

362
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,130
is yourself.

363
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,530
I don't want you to regret it years later

364
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,170
like me.

365
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,680
Back then, I didn't hold my parents' hands

366
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,210
in the hospital.

367
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,830
You taught me all these.

368
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,370
What about you?

369
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,550
Do you really want Dai

370
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,090
to disappear from your life?

371
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,410
I hope you can face yourself

372
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,140
and everyone

373
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,010
as Hao Liang.

374
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,330
Come on.

375
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,270
I'll wait for you at the control station.

376
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,270
Hello.

377
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,530
Hello, everyone.

378
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,610
I'm Cute Mengmeng.

379
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,530
Yes.

380
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,040
You know that

381
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,990
Dai said

382
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,470
she might leave the stage.

383
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,480
I have a good friend

384
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,870
called Dai.

385
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:11,970
Today

386
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,430
is her first livestream

387
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,470
after she came back.

388
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,730
I'm really looking forward to it.

389
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,880
Dear fans,

390
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,280
good evening.

391
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,290
Today

392
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,420
is the day

393
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,360
Dan is coming back.

394
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,050
Today,

395
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,880
I just received the notice

396
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
that Dai is back for the livestream.

397
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,520
I hope everyone

398
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,750
can help me keep her.

399
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,290
Let's try to keep her

400
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,020
because, for this stage,

401
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,750
she really made a lot of effort.

402
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,290
I hope you can go

403
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,170
to her livestream room.

404
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,770
Be locked to 8818.

405
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,290
Be careful, Auntie.

406
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,570
Gu.

407
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,170
Why did you bring me here?

408
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,950
This is what Hao Liang wants you to see.

409
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,430
This is very important to her.

410
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,250
Of course,

411
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,420
it's important to you, too.

412
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,020
Good evening, everyone.

413
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,970
I'm Dai,

414
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,050
a siren streamer

415
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,810
who will conquer you with her singing and beauty.

416
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,260
She has finally appeared.

417
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,200
Dai has started the livestream.

418
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,210
Let's

419
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,810
go to her livestream room

420
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,080
and give her some attention.

421
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,470
Come on! Keep her!

422
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:35,700
Let's go.

423
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,040
This is

424
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,800
the warm-up song

425
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,350
I brought for you today.

426
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,160
Listen carefully.

427
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,020
♫My fragile light♫

428
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,320
♫Only you know about it in the world♫

429
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,280
♫When I play with you♫

430
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,520
♫That is my best look♫

431
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,690
♫Growing up back-to-back♫

432
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,020
♫You hold on to my every step♫

433
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,010
♫Turns out the invitation letter of being in love♫

434
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,560
♫Has been waiting for you to show up♫

435
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,850
♫Who will like you?♫

436
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,290
♫You have a self-righteous bad temper♫

437
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,210
♫I hate you so much♫

438
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,930
♫You always bullied me for fun♫

439
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,150
♫Only after I turned around♫

440
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,330
♫Did I realize that you are♫

441
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,570
♫My youth, which I realized too late♫

442
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,690
♫And my happiness, which I realized too late♫

443
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,660
Thank you

444
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,830
for staying by my side

445
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,530
and supporting me for the last two years.

446
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,600
There's nothing special

447
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,520
I can give you.

448
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,440
Then...

449
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,760
I'll finish this song.

450
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,870
♫You have a self-righteous bad temper♫

451
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,570
♫I hate you so much♫

452
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,240
♫You always bullied me for fun♫

453
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,500
♫Only after I turned around♫

454
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,490
♫Did I realize that you are♫

455
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,160
♫My youth, which I realized too late♫

456
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,130
♫And my happiness, which I realized too late♫

457
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,330
I have a surprise

458
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,330
for you.

459
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,650
Surprise?

460
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,580
Surprise!

461
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,880
I hope you can face yourself

462
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,360
and everyone

463
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,240
as Hao Liang.

464
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,610
Oh my god.

465
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,700
What a surprise!

466
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,060
The annual drama!

467
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,270
Am I blind,

468
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,480
or Dai just looks like that?

469
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,610
You're right.

470
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,760
I'm Hao Liang.

471
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,210
I'm also Dai.

472
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,050
My life

473
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,450
has been split into two halves the whole time.

474
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,750
During the day,

475
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,570
I'm Hao Liang,

476
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,280
a good girl

477
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
who is ordinary and always jitters.

478
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,170
Before I was 18,

479
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,810
I'd been

480
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,160
living a peaceful life.

481
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,240
What?

482
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,490
69 points?

483
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,760
What should I do?

484
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,130
Thank you.

485
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,570
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,440
At night,

487
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,610
I became

488
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,760
Dai who you're familiar with.

489
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,760
My aunt caught a cold one time.

490
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,950
I sang for her in the livestream room,

491
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,680
and that opened

492
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,160
a new world for me.

493
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,170
I've been the Coward Hao Liang

494
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,530
for so many years.

495
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,770
I've never seen

496
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
that side of mine.

497
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,610
I've never imagined

498
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,410
I could be liked

499
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,590
by so many people.

500
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,750
Since then,

501
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,300
the two characters, Hao Liang and Dai,

502
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,090
started to

503
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,770
rotate in my life,

504
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,090
like day and night.

505
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,600
For a long time,

506
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,730
I couldn't even tell

507
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,410
which one

508
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,720
was the real me?

509
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,370
That's right.

510
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,450
I'm Hao Liang,

511
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,410
but I didn't want to be Hao Liang.

512
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,610
She's cowardly,

513
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,250
self-abased,

514
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,150
and obedient.

515
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,200
I thought

516
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,690
only by hiding

517
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,230
behind Dai's mask

518
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,760
could I have confidence.

519
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,990
That was the only way you would like me.

520
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,050
Until

521
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,920
someone showed up.

522
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,640
Are you okay?

523
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,810
For the first time,

524
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,300
someone accepted Hao Liang.

525
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,430
He told me

526
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,090
I didn't have to hide behind the mask.

527
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,470
As Hao Liang,

528
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,540
I can also be excellent

529
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,890
and brave.

530
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,300
I can also face my life.

531
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,600
What matters is that I hired you.

532
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,040
Then you are

533
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,790
the most suitable person.

534
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,230
Your mother is not your enemy.

535
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,660
She doesn't want you to go

536
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,410
because she loves you.

537
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,280
So now,

538
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,850
the only enemy

539
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,810
is yourself.

540
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,670
To walk from the backstage

541
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,410
to the livestream room,

542
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,820
It took me a little more than ten seconds.

543
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,820
However, to walk from Hao Liang

544
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,610
to Dai,

545
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,730
it took me two years.

546
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,660
From Dai

547
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,800
till now,

548
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,740
standing in front of Hao Liang

549
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,100
and become the real Hao Liang,

550
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,580
it took me more than ten years.

551
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,440
Now, it's time.

552
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,740
I want to confess to you.

553
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,130
More importantly,

554
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,850
I want to confess to myself.

555
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,640
I'm Hao Liang.

556
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,530
I'm also Dai.

557
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,250
I like both sides of me.

558
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,610
I hope you like them, too.

559
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,200
We do. We do.

560
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,050
Hello, Dai.

561
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,450
You know

562
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,170
I never got along with you.

563
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,110
But this time, it is an exception.

564
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,230
You're so cool.

565
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,120
Thank you.

566
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,100
If you enter the circle of costume play,

567
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,360
you'll definitely amaze everyone.

568
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,870
Come on. You can do it.

569
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,080
Sister.

570
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,570
I heard you're coming back.

571
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,080
Of course I will support you.

572
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,540
But I also have to tell you:

573
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,530
watch out.

574
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,620
Since you're coming back,

575
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,680
we won't let you go.

576
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,700
Let's fight together

577
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,060
and battle together.

578
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,480
You are braver

579
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,050
than I thought.

580
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,980
Hao Liang, come on!

581
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,530
Dai, come on!

582
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,250
However...

583
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,420
are you really

584
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,200
quitting the Qixiu Grand Ceremony?

585
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,080
We don't want you to quit.

586
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,920
Leave Dai here.

587
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,850
I beg you.

588
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,770
We really can't lose her.

589
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,770
The Qixiu Grand Ceremony…

590
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,470
I'll meet you there.

591
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,560
Yeah!

592
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,630
Really?

593
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,950
Cheer for Dai!

594
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,310
She said she won't quit!

595
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,570
My homie.

596
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,130
Let's work hard together.

597
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,450
Gu Jiuli,

598
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,160
thank you.

599
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,890
I'm not a coward this time.

600
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,930
Come on.

601
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,560
Great.

602
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,560
We all heard it.

603
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,920
Come on.

604
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,480
You are braver

605
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,760
than I thought.

606
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,060
Come on.

607
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,550
Go! Go! Go!

608
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,970
Go! Go! Go!

609
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:41,730
Aunt Yibai.

610
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,580
I did it.

611
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,580
Great.

612
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,170
A hug for your uncle?

613
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,260
You did well.

614
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,030
Go.

615
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,960
She won't stop her from livestreaming, will she?

616
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,770
Mom.

617
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,510
It's been two years.

618
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,370
You've been keeping it from me.

619
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,670
Delete all your accounts

620
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,940
and quit this industry.

621
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,600
I won't.

622
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,830
After graduation,

623
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,510
be a kindergarten teacher

624
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,290
and have a stable job.

625
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,159
That's what you should do.

626
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,670
But singing to everyone

627
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,190
is what I really want to do.

628
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,429
Have you been blaming me?

629
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,429
No, I'm not.

630
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,550
You've grown up.

631
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:54,949
Mom.

632
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,250
Cousin.

633
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,900
Auntie! Auntie!

634
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,460
Don't worry.

635
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,940
I saw her crying.

636
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,300
Mom.

637
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,800
What are you doing?

638
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,850
I'm going home.

639
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,930
You've graduated anyway.

640
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,660
Come home with me.

641
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,270
I don't want to go home.

642
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,760
The final is tomorrow.

643
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,220
I can't go back.

644
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,800
Instead of doing these off-key things

645
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,200
in Shanghai,

646
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,050
you might as well come home with me.

647
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,050
Our school is recruiting teachers.

648
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,430
Get a post in a public institution

649
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,220
and live a stable life.

650
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,190
That's good.

651
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,250
You're only 21 years old.

652
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,700
You just graduated from university.

653
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,600
You haven't even established your value system.

654
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,890
What should you do

655
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,580
if you choose the wrong path?

656
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,120
I'm your mother.

657
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,920
I have to be responsible for you.

658
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:51,840
In the past 21 years,

659
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,570
you made all the choices for me.

660
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,310
This time,

661
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,190
I want to make a choice for myself.

662
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,280
I'll ask you one last time.

663
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,160
Are you going home with me or not?

664
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,590
I...

665
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,780
I'm not going back.

666
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:48,840
Okay.

667
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,940
This time

668
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,230
I can't bring you back,

669
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,820
but that doesn't mean

670
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,780
I've accepted your choice.

671
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,030
Auntie.

672
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,650
Mom.

673
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,820
Mom!

674
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,250
Go after her!

675
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,800
Mom!

676
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,160
Wait.

677
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,870
Mom.

678
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,090
Have you figured it out?

679
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,780
Are you coming back with me?

680
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,340
Ever since I was young,

681
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,400
you've made

682
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,890
every decision in my life.

683
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,160
You're still young.

684
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,130
Why do you want to wear such fancy clothes?

685
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:57,740
This one?

686
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,460
Put it on.

687
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,650
All the way,

688
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,610
I've lived a life

689
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,040
you arranged.

690
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,430
I know it's because you love me.

691
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,380
You were afraid that if I chose the wrong path,

692
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,640
I couldn't be responsible for my choice.

693
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:11,700
Choose science.

694
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,930
It is easier to find a job if you study science.

695
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,760
It is easier to find a job if you study science.

696
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,920
I also admit that

697
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,770
I lived a stable life

698
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,520
under your protection.

699
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,120
That was good,

700
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,110
but not what I wanted.

701
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,460
That's why I was mediocre

702
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,610
and ordinary.

703
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,050
I couldn't find

704
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,580
my value.

705
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,340
Until…

706
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,250
two years ago,

707
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,000
Dai appeared.

708
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,900
Dai is the best!

709
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,300
Dai is so amazing.

710
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,470
I've become her fan!

711
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,190
Up until now,

712
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,030
I'm sure

713
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,690
I love this job,

714
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,080
and I can feel

715
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,740
my value here.

716
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,810
That is

717
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,620
something that I've never had

718
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,370
in the past 19 years of my life.

719
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,490
I've never

720
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,490
regretted being Dai.

721
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,890
The only thing I did wrong

722
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,440
was not having told you earlier.

723
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,090
Mom,

724
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,840
I've grown up,

725
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,090
not only because

726
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,760
I have Jiuli to rely on,

727
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,770
but also because I can

728
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,570
be responsible for my life.

729
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,520
Mom, come home with me.

730
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,320
I won't

731
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,190
hide anything from you again.

732
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,000
Mom,

733
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,660
are you not leaving?

734
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,380
Yes.

735
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,890
Didn't you find someone to rely on?

736
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,100
I'll leave in two days.
