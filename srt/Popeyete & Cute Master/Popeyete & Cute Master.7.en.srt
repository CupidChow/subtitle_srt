1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,880
It's her. It's her. It's her. It's her.

2
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,000
It's her. It's her. It's her.

3
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,520
Where is it?

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,800
The scene is different this time.

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,760
This is the real praising Ao's Great Temple.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,440
Let's go in.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,880
I'll show you the real Kuao's Guru.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,640
Go in.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,760
Is there a place to stay?

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,440
This is the real temple.

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,600
It's not important

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,240
It doesn't matter.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,040
What matters is

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,000
you know who is the real one.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,160
Shen Wang.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,920
Take your life!

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,920
Here we go again.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,280
Kuao E is here.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,720
Demon! Retreat now!

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,560
It's gone.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,160
Shen Wang.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,840
This is your dream.

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Why are you so disappointing?

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,720
You've been bullied by others.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,800
What can I do?

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
I don't know magic.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:25,840
Besides,

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,920
my leg is injured.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,920
Let me tell you.

30
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,800
In your dream,

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,320
you are the strongest.

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,160
Everything changed

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,759
your thoughts.

34
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,280
What do you mean?

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,600
I'll teach you now.

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,680
Focus.

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,800
Imagine that you didn't hurt your foot.

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,600
You don't need this stick.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
Did you hit a little animal?

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,920
Try it.

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,479
Sure.

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Okay.

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,640
Let me think.

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,160
My foot is fine.

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,200
My foot is fine.

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,680
It's really okay.

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,080
See? It's done.

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,199
This is awesome.

49
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,600
You have something else to teach me?

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,760
In your dream,

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,440
in your dream.

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,640
Focus.

53
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Think about something amazing.

54
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:16,920
Think something awesome.

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,320
Something awesome.

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,800
Look at Ngoh.

57
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,200
Shen Wang.

58
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,079
I'll let you think of something amazing.

59
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,440
Okay, I'll think of something awesome.

60
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
Grandpa.

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Grandpa!

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,440
Grandpa.

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
Grandpa, this is fun.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,760
Let me try one more.

65
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,040
This is great.

66
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Jin Mantang, you deserve this.

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,800
Young man.

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,760
What are you doing?

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
No, I told you.

70
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,880
Only a pure-hearted person can do this.

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,720
Don't practice if you're not qualified.

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,280
No, no, no.

73
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,960
Teach me more.

74
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,240
How about this?

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,480
I'll help you rebuild the Great God Temple.

76
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Can you teach me something else?

77
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,840
Really?

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
Leave it to me.

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,000
Here we go again.

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,520
What are you afraid of?

81
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,000
With the praise of Ao,

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,360
in your dream again.

83
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
What can he do to you?

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,480
Go defeat him.

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,720
Beat him.

86
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,760
No, you do it.

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,840
Use what I just taught you.

88
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,880
Go.

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,280
Big sword!

90
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,400
Come on!

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,160
I'll be back.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,519
Young Master!

93
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,440
What's wrong?

94
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,560
What are you doing?

95
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,200
Don't you know the bad guys are in my room?

96
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,720
Where?

97
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,240
He ran over there.

98
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
Go!

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,640
Are you okay?

100
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,480
I'm fine.

101
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,640
I mean your leg.

102
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,080
Let me help you.

103
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,280
Ngoh, take a rest. I'll do it.

104
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,280
Let me wash the vegetables for you.

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,880
Ngoh, you just need to rest.

106
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,400
Madam, let me help you.

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,400
Let me.

108
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,840
What's wrong with them?

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,240
I told them.

110
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,360
From now on,

111
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,520
just take good care of my son.

112
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,440
Good luck.

113
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,000
Come on!

114
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,880
Come on, madam.

115
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,640
Young Master.

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,840
Mr. Jin from a big restaurant

117
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm here to see Ngoh.

118
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,640
What? I'll be right there.

119
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,960
My heart suddenly hurts.

120
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
But aren't your feet injured?

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
What do you know?

122
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
My fingers are connected to my heart.

123
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,120
My heart hurts anyway.

124
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,800
You have to stay and take care of me.

125
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,760
But... But what?

126
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,159
Don't forget who caused my leg.

127
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,440
Zhao Cai, invite him in.

128
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,880
No.

129
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,280
Hey.

130
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,440
Where did you come from?

131
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,520
Ngoh.

132
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,000
I've been missing you lately.

133
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,760
What are you doing?

134
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,840
It's improper for men and women to touch each other.

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,160
Just stand there and talk.

136
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,680
Who are you to control me?

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,760
It's none of your business.

138
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,640
You're so cruel.

139
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,920
You let such a weak girl

140
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040
peel walnuts for you?

141
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,720
You're so cold-blooded.

142
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
You're shameless.

143
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,520
Young man,

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,800
What brings you here today?

145
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Ngoh.

146
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,440
You don't know.

147
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,680
My eldest sister, Jin Yu'er,

148
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,480
arranged a blind date

149
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,080
for me and her best friend.

150
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,760
Can you pretend

151
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
my love?

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,960
Let them retreat.

153
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,080
No, no.

154
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,040
I said no.

155
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,720
Kim Man-dang.

156
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,040
As you can see,

157
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Ngoh is now my personal maid.

158
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
She needs to take care of me.

159
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,680
I can't pretend to be your lover.

160
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,960
Shen Wang.

161
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm just going to help him.

162
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,760
It won't take long.

163
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,480
Besides,

164
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,400
you said I can take a leave.

165
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,640
I said no.

166
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,600
You...

167
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,680
You won't even let me out.

168
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,640
It's unfair to occupy it by force. 50 points deducted.

169
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Even if you deduct 100 points,

170
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,320
No.

171
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,560
So stingy.

172
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
You can't stop me even if I want to leave.

173
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,159
What do you mean? Let's go.

174
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,159
Let's go, little brother. Praise Ngoh.

175
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,800
Come back!

176
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,440
Zhao Cai, Jin Bao.

177
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Zhao Cai, Jin Bao.

178
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,000
Ngoh.

179
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,800
You're so beautiful.

180
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,040
Hey,

181
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,560
I've been wanting to ask you a question.

182
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
Go ahead, Ngoh.

183
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,360
Do you remember this?

184
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
Isn't this our signature dessert?

185
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Pancakes?

186
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,520
I didn't expect Ngoh

187
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
have the same taste as me.

188
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,400
Very good.

189
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,280
Can you do it? Of course.

190
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,960
As the owner of a big restaurant

191
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,840
I entered the kitchen at five or six.

192
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
It's you

193
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,480
