1
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,160
Miss Ngoh! Miss Ngoh!

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm late.

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,360
My sister heard about our relationship.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,360
and locked me in the wood room with the chicken.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,360
How is it?

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
Did my sister give you a hard time?

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,160
No.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,600
Nonsense.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,280
How did you two have a relationship?

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,080
Your sister is good.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,520
She left me her address.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,640
She wants me to visit you more often.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,640
Really?

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,920
That's great.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,120
I also said

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,400
I would invite you to watch a play after the blind date.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Sure.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,480
Thank you for your tickets.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,760
Ngoh.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
It's enough for us to watch the show.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,640
Actually, I bought three tickets.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
I thought about

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,400
another blind date.

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,800
You're so fair.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,080
Master.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Little brother.

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,080
You only care about your little brother now.

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,400
Shen Wang.

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,480
Is it wrong for me to pursue my little brother?

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Why are you so petty?

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
I don't know if I'm wrong or not.

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
I only know

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,720
you are now my personal maid.

34
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,400
I said no.

35
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,560
You can do it if you want.

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,080
I promised to fix it for you.

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,320
It's a praiseworthy temple of Aoe. It's...

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,160
Look.

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,840
You're right.

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,759
You're just afraid of spending money.

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,240
If you have nightmares at night,

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:43,960
don't blame me.

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,720
Are you threatening me?

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,960
I'm not afraid of anyone.

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm going to sleep.

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,640
You serve me to wash up now.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,200
Okay.

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,440
Just wait.

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
You're sitting in a bathtub after foot bath?

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,919
This is enjoyment.

51
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,079
Go ahead. I'm leaving.

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,160
Wait.

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
I don't think the temperature is enough.

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,000
Go.

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
Get me some hot water.

56
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,400
Happy?

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,120
Do you want to scald me to death?

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,120
I asked you to add some hot water.

59
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,760
So much?

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,920
Get some cold water.

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,760
Happy?

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,720
I mean praising Ngoh.

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,400
Don't you have any concept?

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
I asked you to add some cold water.

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,240
Why did you add so much cold water?

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
It's too cold now.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Add more hot water

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,520
Is this okay?

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,520
Add some cold water.

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,360
More hot water

71
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,079
Add some cold water

72
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,120
No, add more hot water.

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,000
How many times has it been?

74
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
Are you done?

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,800
Fine.

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,720
Give it to me.

77
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,720
Can you massage my shoulder?

78
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,360
Watch your strength.

79
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,200
Enough.

80
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,000
I haven't been massaged for a long time.

81
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,800
Give me a massage.

82
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,840
It hurts.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,320
Shen Wang!

84
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,240
Go to hell!

85
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,280
It's hot!

86
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
It's so hot!

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
It's so hot!

88
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,000
Praise Ngoh.

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
How could you abuse my son?

90
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,360
Madam, it's not what you see.

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
Don't worry, I won't abandon you.

92
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,480
I'll help you practice kung fu in your dream.

93
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
Then you can be completely at ease.

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,320
I have nothing to worry about.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
Those bastards!

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
Don’t let me catch them! Shen Wang! Get them!

97
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,000
Otherwise,

98
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,680
I will cut them into pieces.

99
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,280
You're just stubborn.

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,320
I believe

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,800
you are not that cruel.

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,360
Right?

103
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
I've found my little brother.

104
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
You should be independent too.

105
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
I've always been independent.

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,200
Go to sleep.

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,600
What a big cat.

108
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
What's wrong?

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,080
Priest.

110
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,640
Why are you here?

111
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,640
What are you doing on my roof?

112
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,159
Ask your precious son.

113
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,320
You want to run away?

114
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,080
Zhao Cai!

115
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,760
Jin Bao.

116
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,440
Heroine, please spare my life.

117
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,920
I know I was wrong.

118
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,000
I won't do it again.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,360
You're playing tricks.

120
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
in the name of praising Ao,

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,200
in the name of Kuao Ao.

122
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,480
How can we spare you?

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,800
Priest

124
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,720
The Shen family treats you well.

125
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,040
Why did you set us up like this?

126
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
Not bad.

127
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,360
When did I show you feng shui?

128
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
Who gave me money?

129
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,200
The Shen family is born rich

130
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
You don't need to calculate it

131
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,920
You're just pretending.

132
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,080
Just don't pay.

133
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,280
It's fine if you don't pay.

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,320
But...

135
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,200
last month

136
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,920
You said you gave me 5,000 taels of silver

137
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,280
You said my hard work and money.

138
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
He also told me

139
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,640
you must take it back to the temple to open it.

140
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,120
There are many people outside.

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,240
in case we lose money.

142
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,360
I tried so hard

143
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
I dragged him back to the temple.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,120
But when I opened it, I found that it's not a big deal.

145
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,320
Yes

146
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,600
It's a box of stones.

147
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
I know it well.

148
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,000
Did I move with Jin Bao?

149
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,800
Listen.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,960
Listen.

151
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,320
Why are your words everywhere?

152
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
I'll deduct your pay if you keep talking.

153
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,360
Those are all fake.

154
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,360
You're greedy.

155
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,600
You deserve to be cheated.

156
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,680
Wang.

157
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,800
We can't do this to a monk.

158
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,680
I want to have a grandson.

159
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Come on get up

160
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,680
Come up.

161
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
He's quite pitiful. Why don't we let him go?

162
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,520
Wang.

163
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,560
Look at him.

164
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,840
He's quite pitiful.

165
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,960
Give me some money to let him go.

166
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,159
Heroine and madam are sensible.

167
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,880
It's not easy for me.

168
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,960
Stop!

169
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
He's a fake Taoist.

170
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
What charm did he use to make me unable to sleep?

171
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,360
He even crawled to our roof to set me up.

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,120
Don't mention it.

173
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
You didn't lose anything.

174
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,159
Besides, he's mistaken.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,760
That's right. Look how pitiful he is crying.

176
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,640
If he's fake,

177
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,240
we can trust him if we don't use him anymore.

178
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,480
Don't cry. I know you're upset.

179
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,840
Let me tell you.

180
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,920
let bygones be bygones.

181
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Don't use

182
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,200
in the name of Ao.

183
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
If you keep doing this,

184
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,680
let alone guru,

185
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,320
I'll be the first one to praise Ngoh.

186
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,480
Heroine, I know I was wrong.

187
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,840
When I go back,

188
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,920
I will recite the Sutra for you.

189
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
I'll read you a thousand times.

190
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,600
I bless you to have a great grandson

191
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
