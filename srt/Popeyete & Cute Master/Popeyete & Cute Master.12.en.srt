1
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,320
How is it? Is it good?

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,680
You've recovered well.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,880
I told you to hold me.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm not asking you to hold me.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,760
My feet are about to leave the ground.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,760
I'm too strong.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,840
Be careful.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,080
Again!

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,760
I saw a hidden weapon flying.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,560
I just got a new leg injury.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,200
The kidnapper is everywhere.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,600
I can't let my guard down.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,720
Where is the kidnapper?

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,280
The kidnapper ran away.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,680
I'll pull out the arrow for you.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,480
Pull it out.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,320
Wait.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,880
What's wrong?

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,480
It hurts too much.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,680
You're an adult. Why are you afraid of pain?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,040
Don't worry. I'll be quick.

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
I'll pull it out.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,120
No

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,080
Don't pull it out

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,200
Son.

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll bring you some turtle soup.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,360
Mother.

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm sorry

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,120
for disturbing you two.

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,240
Go on.

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,560
Mother, let me explain.

32
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,760
It's not what you see.

33
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,320
Here.

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,320
Good girl.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,000
Miss.

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,880
I haven't asked you where you live yet.

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,960
Taohua Village.

38
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,800
Are your parents still alive?

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
They all passed away.

40
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,280
I feel bad for him.

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,600
It's okay.

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,240
If you marry into the Shen family,

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,200
the Shen family will be your home.

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,039
No, no.

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,440
I have a foster husband.

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,080
It's okay.

47
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,640
I can afford

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
I can afford it too.

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,080
You get along well with Wang.

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,040
Aunt.

51
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm going to hold

52
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,000
a grand wedding.

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,760
It'll be too late

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,880
it'll be too late.

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,160
I can tell.

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,880
Ma'am.

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,480
Darn it.

58
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,680
I will find out

59
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,360
who tried to assassinate me.

60
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,480
This is another trap, Young Master.

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
Can't you see it yourself?

62
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,640
This arrow is poisonous.

63
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Can't you hope for something good all day long?

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,360
to praise Ngoh?

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,640
Mr. Kim is here. He went to see Mr. Kim.

66
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,800
What?

67
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,680
Help me up.

68
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,960
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,160
Give me my shoes.

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,520
Where is Jin Bao?

71
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,880
He went for a walk.

72
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,720
He even sneaked dog.

73
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,440
There's a dog in this house, but he still sneaks away.

74
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,079
Go get the dog.

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,520
You really want Young Master to marry Ngoh?

76
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,800
Of course. I'm her personal maid.

77
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,960
I heard it with my own ears.

78
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,360
Young Master is stingy and mean,

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,400
I think he's quite infatuated with Ngoh.

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,520
Hello, Mr. Jin.

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,680
Today, I must let Mr. Shen know

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,120
Compared to this wild girl who knows nothing,

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,120
I'm the most suitable person to be Young Madam Shen.

84
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,000
Little brother.

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,040
Ngoh.

86
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,040
You're here too.

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,200
Come in.

88
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,880
A perfect match.

89
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,440
A match made in heaven.

90
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,320
A fierce dog is coming.

91
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,760
How dare you!

92
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,840
He looks like a dog.

93
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,840
A dog-skin plaster.

94
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,200
This is nice.

95
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,960
Are you feeling better?

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm fine now.

97
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,640
Ngoh.

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm here to thank you.

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,720
Thank you for saving my life.

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,320
Thank you for saving you.

101
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,760
You're wrong.

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
I was poisoned because of him.

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
That's why we're even.

104
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,360
I owe Ngoh, right?

105
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,000
In that case,

106
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,640
the whole thing

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,520
because

108
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,560
you insisted on taking Ngoh to the opera and drinking.

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Don't be rude.

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
We will remember your kindness.

111
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,080
How about I play the zither

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,000
to express my gratitude to you?

113
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,360
I think...

114
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,280
No need.

115
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,960
Chuntao, bring my qin.

116
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,320
Okay.

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
You play so well

118
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,800
You're welcome.

119
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,240
This qin

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,240
is a must-learn skill from a noble lady.

121
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,640
How can a woman who can't even play the qin

122
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
How can she marry into a noble family?

123
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,960
By the way,

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,120
Mr. Shen told me

125
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,880
Ngoh is your fiancée.

126
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,080
You must be a good qin player.

127
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Why don't you play a song?

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,920
I don't think there's this one. Okay.

129
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,040
What's good?

130
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,240
Can you play the piano?

131
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,600
Didn't you hear that?

132
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,440
A woman who can't even play the qin

133
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
doesn't deserve to marry into a noble family.

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,760
Isn't that the young man's family?

135
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,480
This is a test for my sister.

136
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,680
Are you really good at playing the piano?

137
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,120
Wait.

138
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,320
Don't worry.

139
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,960
I won't let you down.

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,640
Sister.

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,760
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,800
My qin.

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,080
My qin!

144
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,400
My precious zither. Miss. Sister.

145
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,040
Your strings are too weak.

147
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,600
You...

148
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,200
Miss Jin.

149
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,200
I have

150
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,240
in my mansion.

151
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,440
It's useless.

152
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,680
This time,

153
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,280
this time.

154
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,760
Really, Mr. Shen?

155
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,120
All right.

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
It's getting late.

157
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,520
How about

158
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,440
go home separately?

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,240
No.

160
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,120
Look, the spring is just right today.

161
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,000
How about

162
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,320
Let's go to the yard.

163
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,320
Great.

164
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,560
Ngoh and I will draw you a portrait.

165
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,280
What do you think?

166
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,960
I don't think it's necessary next time.

167
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,080
Sure.

168
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,240
I learned painting skills from a famous artist.

169
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,200
Mountain and water characters, flowers and birds.

170
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
All kinds of techniques are so skilful.

171
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,920
You're just a village girl. You're no match for him.

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,360
Just wait to be humiliated in front of Mr. Shen.

173
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,360
Mr. Shen, can you sit down?

174
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,200
In this way,

175
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,960
I can

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,480
your handsome sitting posture.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,760
Sorry.

178
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,800
It's not convenient.

179
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,040
Ngoh.

180
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,240
It's convenient for me.

181
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,240
I can do anything.

182
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,000
Look at you.

183
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,000
You're a disgrace to men.

184
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,840
I can do it too.

185
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,720
Look.

186
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,720
A handsome man

187
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
and handsome.

188
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,920
Mr. Shen is so beautiful.

189
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,040
OK.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Now it's time to vote.

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
Please.

192
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,960
