1
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,680
What would you like to eat?

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,120
Take your time.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
We're looking for someone.

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,600
Look carefully.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,320
The chef

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,680
who can make this dessert

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,640
Call them here

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,200
What for?

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
Just look for him.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,400
He's my adopted husband.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,040
I'm here to marry him.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,800
Miss,

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,720
Actually, I can also make the crispy pancakes.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,800
How about I cook one for you?

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,320
I can do it too.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,520
Cut the crap.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,360
Take him away.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,880
Let's go, miss.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,160
Think about me, girl.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,200
To be honest,

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,680
after hearing what you said,

22
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,440
I remember now.

23
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,880
When I was young,

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,160
I really knew a pretty girl.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,000
She asked me to be her foster husband.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,480
And she looks a bit like you.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,840
You're already 80.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,360
Your age doesn't match.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,200
Go down.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,120
Think about it.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,640
Think about it.

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,039
I'm just old.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,280
I'm not married yet.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm the boy you're looking for.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,840
When are we getting married?

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,640
Ask him

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,000
that only you and the little brother know.

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Where was he saved?

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,560
This is...

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,440
The village of widows.

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,039
The village of widows.

42
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,160
Take him away.

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,000
Then what about Bachelor Village?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,120
Bachelor Village, right?

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,759
I don't remember seeing you when I was young.

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,960
This lady looks pretty.

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,480
If you're willing,

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm willing to be your little brother.

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
But I have only one son.

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:19,920
I can't marry into the family.

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,280
You have to marry me.

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,600
I already have three wives.

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,320
If you marry me,

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,760
you can only be my fourth concubine.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,440
But don't worry.

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,160
I'll be good to you.

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,960
After meeting so many people,

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
you are the most nasty.

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,680
Drag him out.

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,320
It wasn't me. It wasn't me?

61
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,320
Ngoh.

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,320
Next.

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:42,920
Miss.

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,640
I finally found you.

65
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,880
You look familiar.

66
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,800
You pushed me down the stairs.

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,600
No.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,880
I fell down

69
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,280
on the stairs.

70
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
You haven't answered my question.

71
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,120
Right.

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,280
Let me introduce myself first.

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,480
I'm the most talented

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,440
the most talented

75
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,200
handsome, handsome, handsome,

76
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,040
He's handsome, tall and powerful.

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,600
It's known as "Mountain collapse, earth splash, water reverses, Ghost May Cry".

78
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,160
The combination of beauty and wisdom.

79
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,480
Hero and heroic incarnation

80
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,920
I am the most popular

81
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm Kim Man-dang.

82
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,720
If being handsome is a sin,

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm already guilty.

84
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,200
If being handsome is a mistake,

85
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,520
I can't make any more mistakes.

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,480
Who are you?

87
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,160
We have something important to do.

88
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,440
Irrelevant people, get out.

89
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,880
Didn't you say I'm indecent?

90
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,200
Who are you?

91
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm her young master.

92
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
She is my maid.

93
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,079
Do you have a problem with that? Yes, I do.

94
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,840
Miss.

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,800
How dare you

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,040
work for such a rude person.

97
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,960
Don't worry.

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
I'll redeem you right away.

99
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,880
Praise Ngoh.

100
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,600
Come here.

101
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,400
Waiter.

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,160
Where is he?

103
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Did you pick me?

104
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
What do you think?

105
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,720
Miss Jin.

106
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,720
Didn’t you fall down?

107
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,800
The doctor asked you to lie in your room.

108
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,600
All right, you can leave now.

109
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,279
Miss Jin.

110
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Yes.

111
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,800
Never change your name

112
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,880
Never change your surname

113
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,760
I’m the owner of the big restaurant.

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,760
Jin Mantang.

115
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,080
How is it?

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Are you scared?

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,480
Miss.

118
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,840
What's your name?

119
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,640
Ngoh.

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,960
Ngoh.

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,320
That's a good name.

122
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,840
What are you doing?

123
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,360
Who asked you to grab my maid's hand?

124
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,840
Let go! I won't!

125
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,600
Give me Ngoh's indenture.

126
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
Let go!

127
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,840
No.

128
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
Let go. I won't.

129
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,360
I said let go! I won't!

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,080
Let go! Do you hear me? Stop it!

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Jin. I didn't mean it.

132
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
He deserves it.

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,120
Yes.

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,240
It deserves it.

135
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,800
Ngoh.

136
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
This sleeve

137
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,040
It's an honor

138
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
is its honor, Ngoh.

139
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,480
You're disgusting.

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,120
Ngoh.

141
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
Isn't this a bit inappropriate?

142
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,320
Praise Ngoh.

143
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,880
Do you think I'm air?

144
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Are you...

145
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,280
Help me up.

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,880
Shen Wang, let's see where you can go.

147
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,760
Ngoh.

148
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,080
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

149
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,159
Little brother.

150
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,680
Ngoh, what are you doing?

151
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,080
Come and help.

152
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,800
Mom said men like weak women.

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
So many bad guys.

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
So scary.

155
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
Ngoh, don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

156
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,600
Praise Ngoh.

157
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,080
Protect me, Ngoh!

158
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
What are you praising Ngoh for?

159
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,520
Help!

160
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,040
Ngoh.

161
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,920
Let me.

162
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,120
Little brother.

163
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,600
Ngoh, go!

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,360
The other side is highly skilled.

165
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
Shen Wang, stop!

166
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,320
Ngoh!

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,480
Shen Wang.

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,880
I finally caught you today.

169
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,640
Let's go.

170
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,760
Let's go.

171
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,160
Ngoh!

172
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,200
Ngoh.

173
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,159
What?

174
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,040
Aren't you afraid without Jin Mantang?

175
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,120
I have no choice.

176
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,240
My mother said

177
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,320
men like weak women.

178
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,280
I can't expose myself in front of him.

179
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,120
I thought you were naive.

180
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
You're so cunning.

181
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,600
What's so good about Jin Mantang?

182
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,360
Why haven't I seen you

183
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,760
so concerned about me?

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,320
He's my adopted husband.

185
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,240
Of course I want him to like me.

186
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,040
Otherwise, I won't be able to get married.

187
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,480
Are you so sure

188
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,880
he's the guy you're looking for?

189
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,400
Yes, he's the boss of a spoon.

190
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,920
And his body

191
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,640
on his body.

192
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,240
We only met once.

193
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
You even know

194
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,600
about his body.

195
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,320
So you're really going to marry him?

196
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,880
Have you thought it through?

197
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,400
What if he's very stingy?

198
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,600
What if

199
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,679
a crazy mother?

200
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,280
What if this playboy

201
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,440
and has a wife and a concubine?

202
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,520
He won't do this to me.

203
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,080
If he betrays me, I'll beat him.

204
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
He can't beat me anyway.

205
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,520
Sometimes,

206
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,320
I sympathize with Jin Mantang.

207
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,720
You took a fancy to him.

208
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,240
Don't worry. You found a boy for me.

209
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,040
I'll keep my promise and protect you.

210
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,080

211
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,960
Let's go back.

212
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,640
What do you mean?

213
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,960

214
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,480
Let's find out what's going on first.

215
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Where are you going?

216
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,280
Tie him up and interrogate him.

217
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,080
Tie him up!

218
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,760
Be careful.

219
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,280
Ngoh!

220
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,600
How dare you bully Ngoh!

221
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,520
don't blame me for being rude to you.

222
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,560
Ngoh.

223
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,400

are waiting for you to save them.

226
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
With your skills,

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,800
who knows who'll beat who?

228
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,280
Even if it's to help the weak Ngoh

229
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
for Ngoh,

230
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,560
my heart won't hurt so much.

231

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,680
