1
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,640
The ocean is hard to get water

2
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,920
Except Wushan, it's not clouds.

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,080
Boss has a letter for you.

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,720
Who gave it to you?

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,840
A girl named Liu Xiangjuan.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,080
Juan.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,920
Juan wrote to me.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,920
He even bought me chicken with firewood.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,680
Master.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,640
Watch out!

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,360
For love,

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,200
even if I have to go through all difficulties,

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,640
I'll try my best.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm going to meet Zhong soon.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,680
You're here.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
How have you been?

17
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,440
I've been missing you lately.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,800
I think

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,520
we were a couple in our previous lives.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,200
Peace.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,200
Forget about your past life.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,680
Let's be together in this life.

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,480
What is love?

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,880
It tells people to live and die together.

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,360
Don't be emotional.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,560
I drugged the wine in advance.

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,440
Go get him now.

28
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,920
I'll take a look later.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,320
I...

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,560
Go.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,520
What are you doing?

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,160
Wei Zhong.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,880
I suspect you have attempted to kidnap Shen Wang many times.

34
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,280
Come back to the government office with me.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,280
You think you can arrest me?

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,880
It's me.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,120
The wine is poisonous.

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,120
Put him on.

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,960
Be gentle, don't hurt Zhong.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
It won't affect my feelings for you.

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,080
A knife on a lewd head

42
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,160
Shen Wang, you bastard!

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,480
I won't let you off! Take him away!

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,440
It's not over. Let's go.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,760
You deserve it.

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,600
How dare you see my mother?

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,840
Bah! Zhong!

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,440
Loyalty.

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
What are you waiting for?

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,120
Go and comfort your mother.

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,000
I had no choice.

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,360
Zhong.

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,640
I shouldn't have fallen in love with you.

54
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
Zhong.

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
I shouldn't have fallen in love with you.

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,000
That darn love.

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Mom.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,680
You've been crying all night.

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,480
Can you stop for a while?

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,120
Son.

61
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,440
You killed my happiness.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Young Master.

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,640
This is bad. Wei Zhong escaped.

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
What skill is this?

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,360
Such a thick wall

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,560
such a big hole.

67
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Let me out!

68
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
Let me out!

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,959
It's you!

70
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,680
Master, I'm late.

71
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,680
Please forgive me.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,000
You...

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
I have mastered the magic power on it.

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,159
Let me help you deal with Shen Wang

75
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,159
and unify the world.

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,200
What do you want?

77
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
I just want to surpass Shen Wang

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,040
and become the richest man in Ilyao City.

79
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,640
and fed well.

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,280
Master.

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,480
This is what I admire the most about you.

82
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,640
You dare to love and hate. You are wise.

83
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,400
I have admired you for a long time. No.

84
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,760
Give me some when you make money.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,440
Why didn't I notice it before?

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go.

87
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,880
Wait.

88
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,800
Thank you.

89
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,600
It seems Wei Zhong must have an accomplice outside.

90
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,560
You must be careful.

91
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
Wei Zhong will come back for revenge.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,680
Sheriff Shi.

93
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
Let the government issue a wanted warrant.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,920
1,000 taels of gold.

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
A reward for Wei Zhong’s whereabouts. 1,000 taels.

96
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
That much?

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,240
Don't worry, Ngoh.

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,960
I will protect you.

99
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,880
Protect me?

100
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,560
Looks like I have to find a way to restore my power.

101
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,960
This is the real Kuao's Great Temple.

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,080
Yes.

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,440
This is the real compliment of Ao.

104
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,320
It's exactly the same as in my dream.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,760
Of course.

106
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,960
Everything in the dream

107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,760
can be found in reality.

108
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,600
But you know what?

109
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,320
it's really broken.

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,600
Wait.

111
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,800
I'll fix the biggest and luxurious one for you.

112
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,200
It's for Kuao's guru.

113
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,800
Let's go in and say goodbye.

114
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,840
Okay.

115
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,800
What a cute kitten.

116
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,440
Don't move.

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,720
Shen Zhong!

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,000
Wei Zhong.

119
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,320
Let her go.

120
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,880
Why should I listen to you?

121
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm the one you want.

122
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Don't get the innocent involved.

123
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Shut up!

124
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
If you promise to let her go,

125
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,400
I'll give you all I have.

126
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,760
I want all my money.

127
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,760
But neither of you can run away.

128
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,800
Calm down.

129
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,320
It's you.

130
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,000
You didn't expect that, Shen Wang.

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,400
Shen Wang, what's that on your arm?

132
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,080
This.

133
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,159
My mother said

134
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,440
I was kidnapped when I was seven.

135
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,680
This scar was left at that time.

136
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,760
Why didn't you tell me

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,000
about your kidnapping?

138
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
I had a fever after I was kidnapped.

139
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,880
And when I woke up, I couldn't remember anything.

140
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,400
My mother told me these by chance.

141
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,240
What's wrong?

142
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,160
Shen Wang.

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,440
You may

144
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,920
the child foster husband I'm looking for.

145
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,520
What?

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,960
Be serious. I'm dying.

147
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,160
You two are still being lovey-dovey.

148
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,600
Ngoh.

149
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,280
In other words,

150
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,559
I'm your little brother.

151
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,320
So

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
you came to the city to find me.

153
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,039
If it weren't for me,

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
you wouldn't have been my maid.

155
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,440
and you wouldn't have ended up like this.

156
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,440
Ngoh.

157
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,600
Don't say that.

158
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,840
I don't regret it at all.

159
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Meeting you is the best thing in my life.

160
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,880
Ngoh.

161
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,320
You're still showing affection.

162
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,360
You've gone too far! Which of you will die first?

163
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,720
None of you will die, okay?

164
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,440
No.

165
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,240
Give me two days.

166
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,880
I'll think about it and tell you.

167
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
You want to buy time to move reinforcements, right?

168
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,160
I'll kill this girl first.

169
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,040
and let the woman you love die in front of you.

170
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,400
Ngoh.

171
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,840
Impossible.

172
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,120
Young lady.

173
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,600
You hit me so hard.

174
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,600
This...

175
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
What's going on?

176
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,960
So the legend is true.

177
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,200
What legend?

178
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,600
I heard that

179
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
will protect his descendants

180
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
when the descendants are in danger.

181
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,840
and restore their lost power.

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
Let them continue to help the people with their power.

183
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,480
What?

184
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,240
The main actor schedule.

185
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,920
Praise Ngoh.

186
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,920
Lin Zheng Yu.

187
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,240
Shen Wangwang.

188
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,240
Meng En

189
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,520
Zong Muyi.

190
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,520
Jin Mantang.

191
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:44,880
Jin Yu'er.

192
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:44,880
