1
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,800
You're so strong.

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,160
I've never lost

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
I've never lost.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,720
This girl

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,760
is such a joke.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,600
Everyone,

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Anyone else wants to challenge?

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,200
Five taels for once.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,360
1,000 taels.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,600
Come on.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,960
Anyone else wants to challenge?

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,480
In this world,

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,680
is stronger than you.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,520
No.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,960
Something is wrong.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,480
What are you doing?

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,040
What if you hurt someone?

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,280
How do you feel?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,480
How do you feel?

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,039
I don't feel anything.

21
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:14,720
You didn't use your strength.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,600
Actually,

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,360
my best strength.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,120
You mean...

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,400
What should I do? My Dali suddenly disappeared.

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,960
Oh no.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,600
Well done.

28
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,000
I almost believed it.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,400
Of course. I'm a professional.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,960
Next time if you have something like this,

31
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,880
next time.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,520
Okay, no problem.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,640
And this.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,600
are very suitable for you.

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,440
Take a look.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Pick whatever you want.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,800
Where are they?

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
So lively.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,760
Shen Wang is too arrogant.

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,160
and abducted Ngoh again.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,520
What is it?

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,840
We need to visit him.

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
The man who molested on the street just now...

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
Mr. Shen, you're so polite.

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Come with me.

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,280
Miss,

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,440
Why are you here?

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,000
I give up, okay?

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,720
Don't be nervous.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,800
We're here to ask you

51
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,360
if you

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,760
harass that woman?

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,520
I really did it.

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,920
you don't have to be so upset.

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,640
I was just passing by.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
I don't know why

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,240
she started shouting

58
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
saying that I did something to her.

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,680
You caught me

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,360
but you caught me.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,800
I was wronged.

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
So we misunderstood you.

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,160
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,120
Don't feel so guilty.

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,000
Look at my face.

66
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,000
I was born with a bad face.

67
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,560
Since young,

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,160
I've been framed everywhere.

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,920
I'm used to it.

70
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,440
Ngoh.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,600
That woman is a liar.

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,079
In other words,

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,000
we wronged the good people

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,760
and helped the bad.

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
That's why your power disappeared.

76
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,560
Ngoh.

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,720
Did your family tell you

78
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,160
that if you lose your power for doing bad things,

79
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,839
how can you restore it?

80
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,240
The divine power is the blessing

81
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,240
the blessing of the Kuan clan.

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
Even our people

83
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,320
we rarely have.

84
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm the only one in this generation.

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,960
Don't worry.

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,440
I'll ask Dr. Jia to treat you later.

87
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,280
What if there's a cure?

88
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,760
Ngoh.

89
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll do my best to help you.

90
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,360
Shen Wang.

91
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,480
I...

92
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,960
I'm hungry.

93
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
Let's go. I'll take you to eat first.

94
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,360
Judging from your symptoms,

95
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,920
It's caused by the wind demon that makes your limbs weak.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,560
Maybe I should use some decoction.

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,520
Maybe it can heal itself.

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
It stinks.

99
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,080
No, no, no.

100
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,000
If you don't want to take the medicine,

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,480
And...

102
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,680
acupuncture.

103
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,520
Injection adjustment.

104
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,600
If you don't want to get injections,

105
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,560
And...

106
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,920
the plaster adjustment.

107
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,440
Can I stop treating him?

108
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,440
Enough.

109
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,840
Potion, acupuncture and plasters.

110
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,480
Come on.

111
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,960
Don't avoid doctors.

112
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
But this is not a disease.

113
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,000
And I don't want to take medicine.

114
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,880
You're an adult.

115
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,720
Why are you afraid of taking medicine?

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,400
How about this?

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,960
Dr. Jia,

118
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,120
I'll drink the medicine with her and put the plaster on her.

119
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,600
Then she won't be so scared

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,680
she won't be so scared.

121
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,160
Okay.

122
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,200
It's crooked.

123
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,920
It's crooked.

124
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,200
I'm fine.

125
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm fine.

126
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,560
Stop it. You're still acting tough.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
Just lie down.

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,480
Don't collapse before I recover.

129
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,880
Do you feel better?

130
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,400
Is there any sign of Dali's recovery?

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,360
I think Dr. Jia is just a fool.

132
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:40,920
It's okay.

133
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,280
I'll get you

134
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,400
a better doctor tomorrow.

135
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,760
Forget it.

136
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,560
I think my strength

137
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,159
I can't recover after taking medicine.

138
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Don't be upset.

139
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,600
There's always a way.

140
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,560
I just think

141
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,880
I failed to enter the city.

142
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,240
I got the wrong guy.

143
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,360
and lost Dali.

144
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,440
Jin Mantang doesn't deserve you at all.

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
He's not your little brother.

146
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,400
I think

147
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,920
it should be a good thing.

148
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,640
Besides,

149
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,800
without Dali,

150
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
you'll only become an ordinary person.

151
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Without Dali,

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,680
without Dali?

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,720
You protect me.

154
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,480
I think

155
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,640
it's not bad

156
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,360
to praise Ngoh.

157
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,200
Praise Ngoh. Praise Ngoh.

158
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,720
Even as an ordinary person,

159
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,840
I can help others.

160
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,799
Pull yourself together.

161
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,440
Don't let anyone worry about you anymore.

162
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,080
Granny, let me help you.

163
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,760
Ngoh, it's you again.

164
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Thank you so much.

165
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
Granny, give me a hand.

166
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,880
Granny, I'm going to help others.

167
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,640
Why do I feel weak?

168
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,520
Ngoh, come and help me.

169
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,520
Coming.

170
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,840
Thank you.

171
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,920
Thank you, sir.

172
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,800
The main actor table.

173
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,480
Praise Ngoh.

174
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,480
Lin Zheng Yu.

175
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:58,800
Shen Wangwang.

176
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:58,800
Meng En

177
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,080
Zong Muyi.

178
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,080
Kim Mantang.

179
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,440
Dong-tak.

180
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,440
Kim Yu'er.

181
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,000
Li Yong.

182
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,360
Lee Hye-jin.

183
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,360
Mother of Shen.

184
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,680
Li Ning.

185
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,680
One-eyed assassin.

186
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,040
Wang Zhan.

187
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,040
Fatty Assassin.

188
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Special Actor Table.

189
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,360
Xiao, two.

190
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,360
Chen, Wei.

191
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,600
[Strong man with arm wrestling.]

192
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,600
Liang Chen.

193
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:03,920
Young girl.

194
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:03,920
Hu Jiyue

195
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,200
