1
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,520
You deserve it.

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
Compared with me, Shen Wang, who can eat?

3
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,040
Can you compete with me?

4
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,600
Are you serious?

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,160
The dish is poisonous.

6
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,840
Waiter!

7
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,039
Call the doctor!

8
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,280
Brother.

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,760
What's wrong?

10
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,920
I think I got you into trouble.

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,920
He ate all the dishes I ordered.

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,039
Go find the chef.

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:18,840
I'll go find him.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,360
Me too.

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,760
Are you the cook who cooked for me?

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,240
He was here just now.

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,440
Don't think I can't catch you if you run away.

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,240
Give me the antidote.

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,360
and spare your life.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,479
There is no antidote.

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,880
Let's see how long you can be stubborn.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,479
Do it.

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,240
Tell me.

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
I really didn't.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,880
I think you won't cry until you see the coffin.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,480
I have the antidote.

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,880
You again?

28
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
Are you done?

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,720
We've let you go.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,160
Why do you still want to harm us?

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,640
Heroine.

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,720
I didn't mean to hurt you.

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,960
It was someone else.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,280
This is the antidote.

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,320
Go and save him.

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,120
It'll be too late if we're late.

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,800
Who is trying to harm me?

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,920
It's because you're too stingy

39
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,079
because you're too stingy.

40
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,920
Reflect on yourself.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Go and save him.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm leaving.

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,400
Go.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,880
You're leaving already?

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,920
What do you mean by that?

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,680
How am I stingy?

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,600
Make it clear.

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,720
Chef,

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,720
Are you going to tell me or not?

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,400
That person left me a book.

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,760
A 30-year-old man will have spring.

53
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,520
It's not proper.

54
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
I've seen it all.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,480
It's about a story about a man in his thirties

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
who wants to be the richest man through kidnapping.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,120
He must be a pervert.

58
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,600
Oh no!

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,960
You know who it is?

60
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,000
No one cares about Jin Mantang.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,400
Go back to save the young man. Go.

62
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
You have to let me go.

63
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
Don't leave me behind.

64
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,600
Brother.

65
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,280
Brother.

66
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
What's wrong?

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,160
Brother.

68
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,920
Brother.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,880
Don't worry, he's not dead yet.

70
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,520
Come.

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,320
Help him up.

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Sister.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
Brother, you're awake.

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,160
Young man.

75
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,800
Benefactor.

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,320
Mr. Jin's suffering

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
has something to do with me.

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,520
I will take responsibility.

79
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,000
Zhao Cai, Jin Bao.

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,400
Take Mr. Jin to see Dr. Jia.

81
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,480
No need.

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,159
I don't want to see a fake doctor.

83
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,680
I can do it.

84
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,520
Brother.

85
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,880
You're tough.

86
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,040
Benefactor.

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
I can't repay your kindness.

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,680
I can only repay you with my life.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,240
No need.

90
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,360
If you really want to repay me,

91
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,600
pay the bill.

92
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,280
Okay.

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Well,

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,240
Let's meet another day.

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,920
My brother and I

96
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,280
to pay our respects.

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:08,960
Goodbye.

98
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,160
Brother.

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,080
Brother.

100
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,960
Wait for me, brother. Where are you going?

101
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm going to check on him.

102
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
What are you looking at?

103
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,400
He has a sister to take care of.

104
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,480
What are you doing there?

105
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
You didn't eat anything just now.

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
There's an ancient restaurant downstairs. It's delicious.

107
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,200
I'll take you there.

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
I don't want to eat.

109
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
I need to see the little brother.

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,400
Praise Ngoh.

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
Do you have any professional ethics?

112
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,159
You're my personal maid now.

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
You should protect my life.

114
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,480
He was shaking so much just now.

115
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,880
His life is at stake.

116
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,480
Come with us to see him.

117
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,760
Little brother.

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,480
All you think about is him.

119
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
Are you going to see Jin Mantang?

120
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,360
Don’t come back.

121
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,760
Don't follow me.

122
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Those who abandon me

123
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
You can't leave yesterday.

124
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Those who disrupt my mind

125
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,840
will be so worried.

126
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
How can I let her

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,280
find Jin Mantang?

128
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,840
Why should I let her?

129
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Zhao Cai, Jin Bao.

130
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,920
The people of Riyao City

131
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,280
is too realistic.

132
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
I have to buy something to ask someone.

133
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Peach Blossom township is so simple.

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,560
But this pancake is quite delicious.

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,920
It's just a little small.

136
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,480
Here we are.

137
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,160
Sister, it's me.

138
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,160
My brother is fine now.

139
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll take him to the Shen family tomorrow to thank him.

140
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,840
I won't entertain you today

141
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,080
Okay.

142
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,760
I'll see him tomorrow anyway.

143
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,520
Shen Wang.

144
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,120
Run!

145
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,120
Stop right there!

146
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,640
Is it good?

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,040
It was Young Master who offended Ngoh.

148
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,880
Why should Jin Bao and I get beaten?

149
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,520
Do you have a problem?

150
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,360
I dare not.

151
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,760
Hot hot hot

152
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
Have some water.

153
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
It's so spicy.

154
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,520
Ngoh.

155
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,480
You've eaten

156
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,679
and drank.

157
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,840
I've hit him.

158
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,159
I don't think he's angry anymore.

159
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,400
I'm not angry.

160
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,960
But if you

161
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,320
talk to me like this again,

162
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,280
I'll quit.

163
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,720
I swear.

164
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,120
I promise I won't talk like this again.

165
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,800
If I talk to you like this again,

166
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,640
I will...

167
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,600
choked on food and choked on water.

168
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,960
There's no water for shower.

169
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,040
I don't have money.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
The water is so good.

171
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,680
Drink more if you like it.

172
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,720
It tastes like plum.

173
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,560
Oh no, I took the wrong one.

174
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,760
I took it into a wine bag.

175
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,960
Plum wine.

176
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,120
You...

177
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,520
Why did you give her wine?

178
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,440
Why are there two Shen Wang?

179
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,400
Ngoh.

180
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
The sky turns and turns.

181
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,280
There's a boat flying in the sky.

182
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:43,720
The actors' schedule.

183
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,560
Special Actor Table.

184
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,360
Staff Form.

185
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,760
Writer team.

186
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,360
The production team.

187
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,600
Photography team.

188
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:10,920
Art team.

189
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,560
Props team.

190
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:21,880
The recording team.

191
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,160
The venue team.

192
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,520
Meng En's team.

193
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,840
