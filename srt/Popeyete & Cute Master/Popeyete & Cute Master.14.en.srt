1
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,200
How?

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,200
Come with me.

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,080
Where are you taking us?

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,160
To receive guests, of course.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,200
Mr. Han is generous.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,360
He wants to see our new girl.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,280
You two have to take good care of him.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,480
If you offend him, I'll punish you.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:41,880
Let's go.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,880
Come in.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,480
Come on.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,400
Mr. Han.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,080
This is the girl

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,720
who just came here today.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,120
Do you like it?

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:54,960
Not bad.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,280
Not bad.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,240
You may leave.

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,080
Okay.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,720
This beauty

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
It smells so good.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,480
Your face is so tender that you can even squeeze water.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,880
Let me touch it.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,640
Wait.

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,000
Who are you?

26
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,840
Mr. Han.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,920
You're annoying.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
My name is Rou.

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,400
Rou?

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,280
You fell in love with my sister.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,440
You left her alone.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,720
That's too much.

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,080
I fell in love with you

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,680
I fell in love with you at first sight.

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,080
Sweetie, you have good taste.

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:37,840
Here.

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,520
Give me a massage.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,039
Harder.

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,600
Comfortable.

40
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,400
Sweetie.

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,880
You really like me.

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,080
Next time,

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
next time.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,480
Come on.

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,680
Hold it. Come on.

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
Hold it. Let me help you.

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,960
This way.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,680
Take care, Mr. Han.

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
You adapted so quickly.

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,520
You have potential.

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,079
You will be the new Oiran

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
will be you.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
You two took good care of

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
a big client.

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,640
I'll make an exception today.

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,960
to let you

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,120
the selection of the Oiran of Baihua Academy.

58
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,000
The talented

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,320
can serve our new boss.

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,200
I'll sign up.

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,040
Okay.

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,240
Come on.

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,079
Let’s welcome the judges

64
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,320
Welcome the judges of this competition.

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,720
the former famous prostitute, Miss Wang.

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,040
OK.

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,760
He Liu, a famous composer in this city.

68
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,880
Hello, everyone.

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,720
Okay.

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,800
Thank you.

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
Thank you.

72
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,600
Next, let's welcome

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,000
the first contestant.

74
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,480
Let's give him a round of applause.

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,440
My talent today is

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
a rock on my chest.

77
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,640
So barbaric.

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm really scared.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,160
Go down.

80
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Go down. Why did you break a rock in your chest?

81
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
Everyone liked my performance

82
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,600
everyone liked it.

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,120
You did a good job.

84
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,520
It's just that the category is wrong.

85
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,240
I'm out.

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,160
You're the only one left. Come on.

87
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,160
So pretty.

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,640
This is pretty.

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,480
My name is Rou.

90
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,600
I'm bringing you a dance today.

91
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,720
Okay.

92
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,280
Rou.

93
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,160
I didn't expect

94
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,760
as soon as you entered the brothel,

95
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,200
as soon as you entered the brothel.

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,640
I'm born pretty.

97
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,760
All right.

98
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,480
You got a chance to serve your boss.

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,280
He's waiting for you in the innermost room on the second floor.

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,720
Take good care of him.

101
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
I want to bring Xu

102
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,280
to be my backup dancer.

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,720
Okay, go.

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,520
I can't see his face.

105
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,400
We have to make him take off the hat.

106
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,400
I know.

107
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,400
Which one?

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,800
Boss.

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,960
We are ordered to serve you.

110
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,640
I asked the kitchen to prepare four-colored dishes for you.

111
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
Please enjoy

112
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,960
You're a good observer.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,760
You should take off your hat when you eat.

114
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,159
Boss.

115
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
I can dance sword.

116
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,800
Why don't I dance for you?

117
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,280
Let me see

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,040
how good your dance is.

119
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
How dare you!

120
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,400
Who are you? You're so strong.

121
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,120
Good job.

122
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,080
Hold him like this.

123
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Let me see who you are.

124
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,320
Shen Wang.

125
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,080
How did he know my name?

126
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,200
Arrest them!

127
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,760
I want to see who you are.

128
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
Fight with me?

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,080
Do you think I'm a vegetarian?

130
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,440
One more.

131
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Perfect cooperation.

132
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,040
Shen Wang, be careful!

133
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,360
Ngoh!

134
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,280
Help! Put out the fire! It's on fire!

135
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,840
Over there!

136
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,680
Praise Ngoh.

137
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,200
What do you think?

138
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,080
Shen Wang.

139
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't die praising Ngoh.

140
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,840
I still have a lot to tell you.

141
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,240
I like you.

142
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,640
You're okay.

143
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm fine.

144
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,840
How could you be okay?

145
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,720
I saw him just now.

146
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,400
pierced your chest.

147
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,480
You fool.

148
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,280
That sword didn't stab me.

149
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
but the chili sauce in my arms.

150
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,560
I was a little sad.

151
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
That was my last bottle of chili sauce.

152
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
Chili paste.

153
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,040
Then...

154
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,920
what do you think

155
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
what do you think?

156
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,840
What do you mean?

157
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,880
You mean the sentence you like?

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,920
I heard it clearly.

159
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,560
In fact,

160
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,680
besides being stingy,

161
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,920
besides being stingy.

162
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,120
I think so too.

163
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,080
I didn't expect you to like me.

164
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,160
But unfortunately,

165
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
we can't be together.

166
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,840
Because I already have a boy.

167
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,000
I...

168
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,280
Of course I know that's chili sauce.

169
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
Of course I know you're not hurt.

170
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
Who am I?

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,560
I'm the richest man in Ilyao City.

172
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,280
I can get anything I want.

173
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,520
How is that possible?

174
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,120
I like a wild girl like you.

175
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm relieved.

176
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,360
You...

177
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,200
Don't worry.

178
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,160
Praise Ngoh.

179
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,360
Jin Yu'er.

180
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,360
Chen Zhuo.

181
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,680
Dongfang Jun.

182
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,680
Wei...

183
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,160
Jang Myung-shim.

184
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,360
Baby.

185
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,360
Chai Lu.

186
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:41,640
Li Yong.

187
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,000
Lee Hye-jin.

188
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,000
Mother Shim.

189
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,360
One-eyed assassin.

190
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,600
Fatty Assassin.

191
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,560
Liang Chen.

192
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:44,920
[Liang Chen]

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Civil Jia.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Zhao Chenxu.

195
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Citizen B

196
