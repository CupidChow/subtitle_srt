1
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,360
Don't run around.

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,600
Come again.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,880
Ngoh.

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,200
Do you want to buy rouge?

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
What is this?

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,280
This is lip fat

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
on the lips.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
What about this?

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,640
This is called eyebrows.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,840
It's for eyebrows.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,160
Ngoh.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,600
Wake up.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,800
What are you doing?

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,600
It's so pretty.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,480
Ngoh.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,440
Ngoh.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,040
Is it funny?

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,920
No.

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,039
Ngoh.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't go! Wait for me!

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,000
They haven't paid yet.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
Hana.

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,400
Ngoh!

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,080
Be careful.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,680
So many rolls.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,600
You can't eat this.

27
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:44,600
What are you doing?

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Why is there a pancake here?

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,560
Why did you bite me?

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,640
I feel dizzy.

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,320
How is Shen Wang?

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,040
Boss.

33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
Someone ate the poisoned food.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,880
Shen Wang is safe and sound.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Damn it.

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,400
Boss.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,160
You can scold me.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,280
You came up with this plan yourself.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,120
Why am I the one being scolded in the end?

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Why are you not convinced?

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,800
No.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,480
I was wrong.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Shen Wang wasn't poisoned. Who was poisoned?

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,440
It’s fine.

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
I heard a man named Kim Mantang

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,000
shivering all day.

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,440
Nothing happened.

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,920
Is this medicine fake?

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,440
It must be real.

50
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,840
But I gave him the antidote.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,160
Which side are you on? How can you speak for Shen Wang?

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,360
Warrior Zhao, I don’t want to feel sorry for him anymore.

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,120
I just want to know

54
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,040
what grudge you have against Shen Wang.

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,960
Why did you do this to him?

56
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,800
And he used such despicable means.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,720
Can you tell me?

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,760
Shen Wang.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,680
Kidnapping Shen Wang is my lifelong wish.

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Kidnapping Shen Wang is your choice.

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,440
What's wrong? You're not convinced?

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
I want to be the richest man.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,240
You're awake.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,760
Sober soup.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,079
Thank you.

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,600
Did you twist your neck?

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
Why are you looking over there?

69
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,480
What are you doing?

70
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,320
Why is your mouth torn?

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,360
It's none of your business. I got bitten by a dog.

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,920
Why are you blushing?

73
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,160
You have a fever.

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,640
What are you doing?

75
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,320
I don't have a fever.

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,360
I smell something.

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm going to wash up.

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,720
Come here as soon as you're done.

79
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,159
Okay.

80
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,159
Through investigation,

81
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I've summarized.

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,120
In his thirties,

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,800
Male.

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
Through these keywords,

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,680
I've listed the following list.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,640
Zhao Cai.

87
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Read it to Ngoh.

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,880
Okay, Young Master.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
Mr. Zhang from the restaurant next door.

90
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
Mr. Han from Chengxi Cloth Shop.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,520
Mr. Fang from the east of the city.

92
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
three suspects

93
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,800
and other 80 suspects.

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,880
Shen Wang, how many people have you offended?

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,200
It's already narrowed down.

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,760
After all, Young Master was stingy

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,480
because he's stingy.

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,640
causing countless enemies.

99
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,640
It's called hate and hate.

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
All right. The purpose of our investigation today

101
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,560
is to see who

102
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,120
who wants to set me up.

103
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,040
Let's begin.

104
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,640
I... I didn't fall asleep, Young Master.

105
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,120
I asked you to analyze the suspect here.

106
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,640
I had a good rest.

107
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm sorry, Young Master.

108
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,360
Go.

109
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,520
Call Jin Bao here.

110
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,400
Yes, Young Master.

111
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,360
She eats rice every day.

112
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,800
Praise Ngoh.

113
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,800
Don't sleep here.

114
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,240
Get up and look for clues.

115
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,840
Are you pretending to sleep?

116
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,720
He really fell asleep.

117
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,680
The ledger I gave you is everywhere.

118
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,520
Let me see what you did in your dream.

119
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,560
Shen Wang, why are you here?

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,760
Are you eating again?

121
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
I'm here to send you desserts.

122
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,080
Praise Ngoh.

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,760
Do you usually come here in your dreams?

124
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,480
Yes.

125
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,880
I've been like this since I was a kid.

126
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,960
When I'm free,

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,040
I like to praise you for being here.

128
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,320
It's safe and comfortable here.

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
Now I know

130
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,760
why this place is so shabby.

131
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,360
Shen Wang.

132
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,600
I've found a boy now.

133
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,760
You can't go back on your promise.

134
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,880
You mean renovating the Great God Temple?

135
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,480
Yes.

136
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I can help you now.

137
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,080
Are you kidding me?

138
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
We are in my dream now.

139
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,920
Don't think I don't know.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
I'm talking about a temple in real life.

141
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,360
Okay.

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,360
Don't worry.

143
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,240
I will keep my promise.

144
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,320
That's good.

145
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,040
Wait.

146
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,960
It's delicious.

147
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,080
Thanks for the food last night.

148
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,240
You're welcome.

149
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,280
You can't change your promise.

150
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,799
I'll try my best.

151
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
What happened last night...

152
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,840
That was a dream. I'm a little hungry now.

153
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,760
I should go eat something.

154
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,760
Have some oranges, Ngoh.

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
How is it?

156
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,520
Is it good?

157
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
It's so sour. Why is it so sour?

158
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,000
Did I pick the sour and sour ones?

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,720
Didn't you pick the sour ones?

160
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
That's right. Since we're here,

161
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
We've already eaten

162
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
No, no. Hurry up and eat it all.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,480
I chose this specially.

164
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,440
Don't run, Ngoh. My teeth are sore.

165
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,520
Your Highness, eat it all, okay?

166
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,920
Don't let her eat if she doesn't want to?

167
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,080
Shen Wang, your leg has recovered.

168
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,200
Yes, a little.

169
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,920
This is the power of love.

170
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,960
Come, Ngoh, eat the tangerine. No, no.

171
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,200
Don't let her eat if she doesn't.

172
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,120
Ngoh, put the tangerine

173
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,560
of the mandarin.

174
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,280
Praise Ngoh.

175
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,280
Lin Zheng Yu.

176
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,560
Shen Wangwang.

177
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,560
Meng.

178
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,840
Zong Muyi.

179
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,840
Jin Mantang.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,240
Jin Yu'er.

181
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,520
Dongfang Jun.

182
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,120
Li Zi Chen.

183
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,120
Mother of Shen.

184
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,440
Li Ning.

185
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,440
One-eyed assassin.

186
00:09:59,520 --> 00:09:59,800
Wang Zhan.

187
00:09:59,520 --> 00:09:59,800
Fatty Assassin.

188
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,400
Special Actor Table.

189
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,080
Xiao, two.

190
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,080
Chen, Wei.

191
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,400
A strong man with arms wrestling.

192
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,400
