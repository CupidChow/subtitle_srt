1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,040
Shen Wang.

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,760
How much should we pay for this?

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,440
You stinky dishwasher.

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,480
How could you fall Mr. Zhao like this?

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,680
Wait a minute.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,200
What did you call him?

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,240
Mr. Zhao.

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,840
Mr. Zhao

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,400
Welcome, Young Master Shen

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,840
I didn’t recognize you.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,280
Order whatever you want.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,120
Anything.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,960
You're welcome.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,080
Let's go.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,040
If you need any help,

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,920
just let me know.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
I didn't expect

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,000
so weak.

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,640
Short.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,600
Short.

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,680
Am I weak?

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,720
This is...

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,080
Wait.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,600
You're too strong.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,640
Praise Ngoh.

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
How are you going to make it up to me?

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,080
Compensate me?

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
Of course.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,880
Let me calculate for you.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,160
Medical fee.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,280
Mental damage.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,960
The pay for negligence

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,000
The total is 50 taels and eight coins.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,240
I'll make it up for you.

36
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,360
50 taels.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,640
Pay up.

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,640
That much?

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
That's all I have.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,240
Can I pay first?

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,520
Of course not.

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,840
Who said that just now?

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,000
It's wrong not to pay.

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,960
How about this?

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Stay here and be my personal maid.

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,480
These money

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,000
can be deducted from your salary.

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,760
No.

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,720
I have to hurry up and find the young man.

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,079
When I find him,

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
and solve the big problem of my life,

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,600
and work hard to pay the debt.

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,520
Are you that important

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you have to find him?

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Of course.

56
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,960
Ten years ago,

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,040
I was gathering herbs in the mountain.

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
Help!

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,280
Help! Help!

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
I suddenly met a bad guy

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
tied up to a guy.

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
Help!

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
Let go of that young man! Help me!

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,440
Help!

65
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,320
Help!

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
How dare you meddle in my business?

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
Dali female monster.

68
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,400
I saved him.

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you okay?

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't hurt me.

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,360
I'll give you the crispy pancakes.

72
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,840
He was grateful to me.

73
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
so he went home with me.

74
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Drink this. I made this cold-repelling soup myself.

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,360
Is this ginseng Lingzhi?

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,079
What?

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,960
This is a centipede, a scorpion, a black spider.

78
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
Take the medicine.

79
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,840
You're so weak.

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,320
I was wondering if you were strong enough to get engaged.

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,840
So,

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
God sent a boy here.

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,280
You saved his life.

84
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,360
Let him be a child foster husband.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,040
What do you mean?

86
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,960
Child?

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
is the person who can live with you

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
who can care about you and take care of you.

89
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,640
That's great.

90
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,760
I'll make some more cold-repelling soup for him.

91
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,520
Okay.

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,680
Where's the boy?

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,520
What's this?

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,920
It's delicious.

95
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,760
He must have lost his way in the mountains.

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
I'm going to find him.

97
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,320
I can't eat anymore.

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,440
After more than ten years,

99
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,080
I decided to come to Riyao City to find the young man.

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,080
That's all?

101
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Isn't this enough?

102
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,440
Ngoh.

103
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,560
Have you ever thought about your little brother?

104
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
he wanted to run away?

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,600
Impossible.

106
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,960
He left me

107
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,720
to me.

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
He must be waiting for me to find him.

109
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,040
That makes sense.

110
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,000
You're right.

111
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,400
Stop it.

112
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,920
Ngoh.

113
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,000
How about

114
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,320
bring me the dessert?

115
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,880
You...

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,960
Your pancake

117
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,240
can still be seen

118
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,960
we can still see

119
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,720
on the crust.

120
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:46,560
Yes.

121
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,480
So it's not impossible

122
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,120
you can find him.

123
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,320
But

124
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,320
you have to stay as my maid.

125
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,320
in return.

126
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,480
What do maids do?

127
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
A maid is...

128
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
to protect me.

129
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,360
If I run into bad guys,

130
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,720
I'll punch them off.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,960
Just like this table.

132
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,040
Of course.

133
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,040
I can give you two months.

134
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,320
the adjustment period.

135
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
If you are unhappy these two months,

136
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,200
you can leave anytime.

137
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,320
Deal.

138
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,200
All right.

139
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,920
From today onwards,

140
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,440
Party B praises Ngoh

141
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,120
to be Party A's maid.

142
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,920
to protect Shen Wang in secret.

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,480
The adaptation period is two months.

144
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,159
If Party B praises Ngoh

145
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,840
is unhappy,

146
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,440
you can leave Shen's mansion anytime.

147
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,760
Is that okay?

148
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,720
Here.

149
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,600
Press your fingerprint.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,320
Okay.

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,560
By the way,

152
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,720
For the sake of safety,

153
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,080
From now on,

154
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
you have to call me Young Master.

155
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,520
I...

156
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,520
I'll call you

157
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,600
Ngoh.

158
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,240
What?

159
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,440
Secret martial arts?

160
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,680
It says

161
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,440
if Party B praises Ngoh

162
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,240
if Party B praises Ngoh's unhappy life,

163
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,760
you can leave Shen's mansion anytime.

164
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,520
I'm afraid I'll forget it.

165
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,120
so I prepared a notebook to record it.

166
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,159
If you do well, you'll get extra points.

167
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,280
If you make me unhappy, I'll deduct points.

168
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,920
If you don't get 50 points,

169
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,960
I'll quit.

170
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
That's true.

171
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
You're smart already.

172
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
It’s my style.

173
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,440
As expected of the maid I chose.

174
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,080
Shen Wang,

175
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,080
You owe me money.

176
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,480
How dare you ask someone to beat me?

177
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,640
I told you to be stingy.

178
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,240
I'll torture you.

179
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
I...

180
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,520
I won't kill you.

181
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,760
I'll torture you?

182
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,200
How dare you lie to me with a fake stone?

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm full.

184
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,520
Go to sleep.

185
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,840
Where should I sleep?

186
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,120
I don't sleep much at night.

187
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,240
You don't sleep?

188
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,159
Yes.

189
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,240
I...

190
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm afraid of your compliment

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,919
after me.

192
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
I told you

193
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,159
that the guru of E doesn't kill people.

194
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,440
The one who killed you in your dream

195
