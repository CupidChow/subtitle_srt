1
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,640
Hey.

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,320
Young man.

3
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,400
What are you doing?

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,920
I spilled chili sauce.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Who is this?

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,320
What are you looking at?

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,440
I'll dig your eyes out if you keep looking.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,720
Why are you so fierce?

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,960
How rude.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,320
What can I do for you?

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,400
Isn't the flower festival in a few days?

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,400
There will be a lively lantern festival in the city.

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,280
I want to invite you.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,160
Sure.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,600
What's good?

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,440
Did I ask for leave for you?

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,039
Shen Wang,

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,039
You're a generous and handsome man.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,880
Right?

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,320
Just let me go.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
Please.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,520
Go home.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll be there. Don't worry.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,000
Wait for me. Okay.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,520
Wait for me.

26
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,480
Bye.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,320
Bye.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,400
Shen Wang.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,920
Done.

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,160
Shen Wang, wait for me!

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,880
What are you doing?

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Are you sick?

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,840
Why are you so emotional?

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,800
Praise Ngoh.

35
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,560
Are you my maid?

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,920
Will you listen to me?

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,720
Okay.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,160
Go now.

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,560
and beat Kim Mantang up.

40
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,560
Why?

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,120
I don't like him.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,920
No, I'm not going.

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,080
You just said you'd listen to me.

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,880
I did promise to protect you.

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
but he didn't threaten your safety.

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
Why should I bully him?

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,880
Besides,

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,000
my divine power comes from my ancestors.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,200
Praise the god of Aoe.

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,840
I can't do anything bad.

51
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,880
Otherwise, my power will disappear.

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,240
You mean

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,000
your power will disappear if you do something bad.

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,960
At worst,

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
I'll take you to the lantern festival tomorrow.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,480
Stop picking on him.

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,360
Okay?

58
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,920
Take me to the lantern festival.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,079
That's more like it.

60
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,840
But you just told me

61
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,400
that your power will disappear.

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
Don't tell anyone except me.

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
Son, you're back.

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,640
What were you two doing?

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,320
You're playing quite well.

66
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,200
Mother.

67
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,480
You...

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,840
What are you doing?

69
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,920
Son.

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,720
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

71
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,960
Let me go out for a walk.

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,040
It's late at night.

73
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,440
in the middle of the night?

74
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Son.

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,400
I feel wronged.

76
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,280
Just let me go out for a walk.

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Is she sick?

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,520
You...

79
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,280
I told Zhao Cai and Jin Bao to keep an eye on you.

80
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,160
Where are they?

81
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,120
They're sleeping.

82
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,079
Time to sleep.

83
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,200
Those bastards.

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll deduct their pay tomorrow.

85
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
It's too late now.

86
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,360
Can I go with you tomorrow?

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,640
No.

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,040
Mother, go back. I want to go out and play.

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
Go back to sleep. I'm not sick.

90
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,960
I want...

91
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,320
I want to go out and play.

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,240
Come and help.

93
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,440
I'm not sick. I'm going out to play.

94
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,200
Come back, mom.

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
Are you sure?

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,920
It's true.

97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,240
That girl is not born with divine power.

98
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
We have a way to deal with her.

99
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,800
I'll say the first line.

100
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,680
You mean

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,600
Shen Wang didn't let his mother out?

102
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,440
I saw it with my own eyes.

103
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Shen Wang, that bastard.

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,480
I’ll kill you!

105
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Little brother.

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Ngoh, you look so pretty today.

107
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,920
Mr. Shen, are you that free?

108
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,920
What is it?

109
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,280
Don't say that.

110
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,760
It's practical.

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,320
Let's go.

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
Come on, young man.

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,520
Guess lantern riddles.

114
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,640
We won the lights.

115
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,000
Guess the lantern riddle.

116
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
You won the lottery lantern.

117
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,320
It's a lantern riddle.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,360
Sir.

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,640
Guess a riddle.

120
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,240
What's in the middle of Sunshine City?

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,720
Could it be...

122
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,800
Wang Cloth Shop?

123
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,320
or Song's tofu shop?

124
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,520
In the middle of Sunshine City,

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,280
of course it's "Yao".

126
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,920
You're right.

127
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
A hammer egg.

128
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,880
Why can't the hammer break?

129
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,760
Why?

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,760
Is the hammer not strong enough?

131
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,800
Ngoh.

132
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,720
Do you know?

133
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
I don't know either.

134
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,280
A hammer egg.

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,000
The broken one is the egg.

136
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,040
Why is the hammer broken?

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,400
Sir.

138
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,880
is amazing.

139
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
Yes, Shen Wang.

140
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,880
You're so fast.

141
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
I want wonton and noodles

142
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,960
One word.

143
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,680
This...

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,880
Let me think.

145
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,360
Speak one word.

146
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,080
It's a "Peh".

147
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,760
Sir.

148
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,920
You're so smart.

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,680
This is

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,760
the most beautiful lantern here.

151
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,120
For you.

152
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,360
Ngoh, this is for you.

153
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,200
Do you like it?

154
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,680
What's wrong?

155
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,480
I don't feel happy.

156
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,440
Do you not like lantern riddles?

157
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,159
No.

158
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,280
I saw the wontons and noodles

159
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,880
there are wontons and noodles.

160
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:44,840
I'm hungry.

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
Ngoh, you're hungry.

162
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,200
There are a lot of snacks inside.

163
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,320
It's something you can't eat normally.

164
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,600
I'll take you there.

165
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,520
Okay.

166
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,000
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

167
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,800
Guess the riddles.

168
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
To be honest,

169
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
The riddle I just guessed

170
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,520
wasn't very serious.

171
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,640
What?

172
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
Someone can't guess the riddle.

173
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,400
You're acting like a rogue.

174
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,640
Of course not.

175
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,640
I grew up in the south.

176
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Our wontons are not wontons.

177
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,240
It's called wonton.

178
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,440
There's another kind of noodles called wonton noodles.

179
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,640
If one of them wants to eat wonton,

180
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
and the other wants noodles

181
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,520
just make a bowl of wonton noodles.

182
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,640
He grew up in the south.

183
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,680
Yes.

184
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,240
I was raised by my grandmother

185
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,240
I came to Ilyao City with my father when I was 15.

186
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,840
That's not right.

187
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,480
What's wrong?

188
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,880
You only came to Yoyo City at 15.

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
This doesn't match

190
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,080
your age.

191
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
Are you

192
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,159
a little boy?

193
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,960
Ngoh.

194
