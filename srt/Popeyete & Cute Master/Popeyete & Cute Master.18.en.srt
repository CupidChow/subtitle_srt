1
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,640
We must tie Shen Wang up this time.

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,320
Master Shen Wang

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,120
is gone now.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,240
the protection of that strong woman.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,960
It's easy to catch him.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,280
Shen Wang, you can't escape.

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,280
Master has something.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,360
It seems that the legend is true.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,760
What legend?

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
It's said that a master named Dongfang

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,120
died in this yard.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,640
He really hid the secret book here.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,960
Forget it. This doesn't suit us.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,160
Throw it away.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,280
The Sacred Volume.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,280
Shen Wang!

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,360
Take your life!

18
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,800
What's going on?

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,320
I don't know.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,960
It was a mistake.

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,600
Go to hell! Watch out!

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,600
It hurts.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,880
Are you out of your power?

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:44,960
Run!

25
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,920
Where are you going? Stop!

26
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,280
Where is he?

27
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,440
Here.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,880
How is it?

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,200
Shen Wang.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,840
I didn't expect you to be so good.

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
I have many advantages.

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,639
You'll find out later.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,480
It's okay if you lose your power.

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,800
I will protect you.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,000
No matter what,

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,880
What?

37
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,040
I will

38
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,760
protect you as always.

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
What's wrong?

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,360
I don't know.

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,160
My heart feels a little uncomfortable.

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,520
I'm not feeling well.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,560
Maybe I ran too fast just now.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
It's okay. I'll take you to the doctor now.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,320
Let's go.

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,280
Shen Wang seems different from before.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,280
I don't know why my heart is beating so fast.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,080
Is he really sick?

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,400
I didn't expect

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,160
I always hide behind Ngoh,

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,320
I have the day to protect her.

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,760
I have someone I want to protect.

53
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,800
I don't feel scared anymore.

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Now that I think about it,

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,360
it's good that your power is gone.

56
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,680
You and Ngoh are getting married.

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
I've found

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,079
who I want to protect forever.

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
I'm willing to marry Shen Wang.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I like him very much.

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,480
Sure.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,720
This is our Shen family's wedding.

63
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Don't worry.

64
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,920
I will make your wedding

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
a grand wedding.

66
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,680
The Shen family is going to have a wedding.

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,120
My son is getting married.

68
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Your wife seems to be much better.

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,440
Maybe

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
this is

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
the power of love.

72
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,040
Ngoh.

73
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,480
From now on,

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,520
the contract between the maid and master will be canceled.

75
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,640
From now on,

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,360
we are husband and wife.

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
Maid master.

78
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Is there any difference

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,159
between you and your wife?

80
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,000
What's the difference?

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,240
A maid?

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
I have to serve Young Master.

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,600
but a husband has to serve his wife.

84
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
I have to listen to you in everything.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,280
My husband has to listen to my wife.

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
And maids and young masters

87
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,280
can't be intimate.

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,560
Husband and wife can be intimate.

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
What do you mean by intimate?

90
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,680
This is called intimate behavior.

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,159
Shen Wang.

92
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,240
I'm fine. I landed easily.

93
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,000
So you can get up from me, right?

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,720
Kim Mantang.

95
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,280
Why are you under my butt?

96
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,680
Can you be reasonable?

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
I was hit

98
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,120
who fell from the sky.

99
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,280
Look carefully.

100
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,960
You're standing in my territory now.

101
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Who asked you to come to my mansion?

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,040
Do you think I want to come?

103
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,240
If it weren't for

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
for Ngoh,

105
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,080
I won't come even if you invite me.

106
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,680
You heard what I said

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,320
what I said to Ngoh.

108
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,320
I didn't eavesdrop.

109
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,080
You were too loud.

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,280
That means you heard it.

111
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,800
Ngoh already rejected you.

112
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,320
Why are you still pestering me?

113
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,280
So what?

114
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,800
We can get divorced after getting married.

115
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,560
My love for Ngoh

116
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
will never change.

117
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,320
Mr. Kim.

118
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,520
Ngoh.

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,720
Ngoh, look at this.

120
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,840
It's all broken.

121
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,880
It's all your fault.

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,800
Alright.

123
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,440
Your dessert has arrived.

124
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,160
Please go back.

125
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,720
It's getting late.

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,360
Ngoh and I need to rest early.

127
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll take her shopping tomorrow.

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay?

129
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
What's this smell?

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,840
Ngoh.

131
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,800
This flower is for you.

132
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
I even prepared a poem for you.

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,360
I'll read it to you.

134
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,520
The flower meets the post envoy.

135
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,520
and sent it to the man of the Garden.

136
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,320
I have nothing in Jiangnan

137
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,600
A spring for a chat

138
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,600
Shen Wang, you're so talented.

139
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,480
But what does this poem mean?

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,600
what this poem means.

141
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
It means

142
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,480
Shen Wang, do you think

143
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,120
the incense in this shop

144
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,320
looks familiar.

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
A familiar?

146
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,960
This is different from

147
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,240
in the brothel

148
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,000
is the same.

149
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,760
Sir.

150
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,280
Sir.

151
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,080
Sir.

152
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,039
Where did you get the incense?

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,159
Young Master.

154
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,559
You like this incense too?

155
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,039
This incense is not simple.

156
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,960
It’s made of

157
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,680
these ingredients.

158
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,280
It can cure kidney deficiency.

159
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,520
to cure kidney deficiency.

160
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,800
to cure kidney deficiency.

161
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,960
If you want it,

162
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,000
if you want it.

163
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,760
After all, this incense is limited

164
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,080
is limited to sale every month.

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,200
Sir.

166
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,280
I have

167
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,200
some folk remedies for kidney deficiency.

168
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,800
If you are interested,

169
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,040
No need.

170
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,560
You use this to make the fragrance of the flower shop.

171
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,880
Sure.

172
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Young Master, this is a good thing.

173
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,040
Ngoh.

174
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,080
Let's go to Riyao Clinic.

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,520
Sir.

176
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,160
All right.

177
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,240
Master.

178
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,520
Why are you...

179
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm not crying.

180
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,120
I must catch Shen Wang.

181
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,360
I must catch him.

182
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,040
I want to catch Shen Wang too.

183
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,120
I wonder how Juan is now.

184
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,120
I made a perfect plan.

185
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
We will succeed this time.

186
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,840
Help me inquire about Shen Wang.

187
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,880
You must give this letter to Juan personally.

188
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,920
I got it, Master.

189
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,240
Mr. Shen.

190
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,200
These are all customers’ privacy.

191
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,800
Cut the crap. Didn't I give you the money?

192
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,240
Take your time.

193
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,360
