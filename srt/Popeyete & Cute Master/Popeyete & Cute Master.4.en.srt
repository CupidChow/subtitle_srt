1
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,040
It works.

2
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,080
Shen Wang.

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,440
I am the God of Kuao E.

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,960
You keep teasing me.

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,920
I'll make your life miserable.

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,520
Take your life!

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,040
It works.

8
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
Who broke my Dream-entering Magic?

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,640
Thank you for saving me.

10
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,080
Immortal, help me!

11
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,520
Shen Wang!

12
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,160
Shen Wang!

13
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,440
Shen Wang, calm down.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,800
Shen Wang!

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,720
Somebody help me

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,160
You're awake.

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,440
Why did you hit me?

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,120
You've been on the floor.

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,600
You broke the chili sauce.

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,800
You didn't wake up.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,160
You even kowtowed.

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,400
Did I kowtow?

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes, he did.

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Did you get hunted

25
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,960
in your dream again?

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,400
Praise the god of Ao.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,600
Impossible.

28
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,320
How about this?

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,160
we sleep together tonight?

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,200
I'd like to see

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,000
who this fake guru is.

32
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,000
Sleep together.

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,840
How do we sleep together

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
Sleep together means sleeping together.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,640
How can I sleep?

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,680
Zhao Cai, Jin Bao.

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,760
Why did you lock the door?

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,280
Young Master.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,480
Madam asked you to stay in your room.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,760
She won't let you out for three days.

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
Are you two trying to rebel?

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Open the door!

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,280
You won't open it?

44
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,480
It's not easy for me.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,360
Let me try.

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,720
You two betrayers!

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,160
Who asked you to lock me up?

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,520
Would you like some of my private 37 cream?

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
It won't hurt if you apply some on your face.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
How did you get out?

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,360
I walked out.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
My Golden Silver Wood Gate.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,200
I brought it from the south.

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,440
Why did you ruin it?

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
My heart hurts.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,600
Ginseng slices.

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,760
It can cure heartache.

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
I don't want this.

59
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,360
Pay me.

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,400
Three taels of transportation fee.

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,760
25 taels of gold silk wood.

62
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,920
10 taels of compensation.

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,440
38 taels in total.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,200
Pay me.

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,640
What are you doing?

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
You're so ungrateful.

67
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,840
Not kind enough.

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,840
Points deducted.

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,280
I'll give you half discount, okay? 19 taels.

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,920
No, I quit.

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,000
Hey,

72
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,560
Half price is half price.

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,200
Ngoh.

74
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,480
Look.

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,520
Most of the snacks are here.

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
The only clue we have now

77
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,680
is dessert.

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:34,880
You

79
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,080
try one by one.

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,760
Which one tastes the most similar?

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,640
Let's continue our investigation.

82
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,640
It can be considered

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,320
for helping me.

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,480
Ngoh.

85
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
If you can't eat it,

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
you can split it in half.

87
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,760
We can help you.

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,680
No, no, no.

89
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,600
I don't need your help to eat this.

90
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,400
Eat it all.

91
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,720
This

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
This tastes the most similar.

93
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,640
This one.

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,920
A big restaurant.

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,840
Now,

96
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,360
I've basically found something.

97
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,080
But I'm a little sleepy at noon.

98
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,760
Let's take a break.

99
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
I'll continue the investigation with you later.

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,720
What do you think?

101
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,560
How about this?

102
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,040
I'll help you catch the fake guru.

103
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,120
Now,

104
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,400
I'm full and I'm full.

105
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,400
Aren't you sleepy?

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,120
Go to sleep.

107
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,000
Sleep.

108
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,080
When are we waiting?

109
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,640
Hurry up, go back to your room.

110
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,320
No.

111
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,000
Slow down.

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,760
It hurts.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
Young Master, you've made great progress.

114
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,520
What a quick return.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Look at these girls.

116
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,440
She's really not reserved.

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,120
I can't help eating snacks.

118
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,800
How can I sleep like this?

119
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,480
Why can't I sleep?

120
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,600
Aren't you sleepy?

121
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,200
Let me help you.

122
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,040
No.

123
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,720
I'll sleep alone.

124
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,120
Again?

125
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,240
Praise Ngoh.

126
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,520
Where are you?

127
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,240
Shen Wang, take your life!

128
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I'll kill you!

129
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,680
Stop!

130
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,080
Deity!

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,600
Who dares to stop me from praising you?

132
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,760
Who are you?

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
How dare you pretend to be Guru Kuao E?

134
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
Little fairy, you'll die!

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
You're a fairy!

136
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,080
A fight between immortals.

137
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,320
Call him back if he wants to run.

138
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,880
How?

139
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,440
Is this your dream?

140
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
I can't hide from him. I still called him.

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,960
It's useless.

142
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,920
What's going on?

143
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
You're useless.

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,360
If it weren't for you,

145
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,600
I would have caught him.

146
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm not an immortal.

147
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
I don't know magic either.

148
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,280
How can we catch him?

149
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,760
It's not magic.

150
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
It's just a simple dream-entering spell.

151
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,480
Anyone can learn it.

152
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,520
Can I learn too?

153
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,400
As long as you have a pure heart.

154
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,760
It's okay.

155
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,160
I already marked

156
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,760
on that bad guy.

157
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,360
We can find him

158
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,120
according to the mark.

159
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,720
What mark?

160
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,120
I'll tell you next time.

161
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,640
Let's go find the young man first.

162
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,600
Who is this girl?

163
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:13,920
Praise Ngoh.

164
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,840
Keep up.

165
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,080
Coming.

166
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,640
Who am I?

167
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,840
Where am I?

168
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
What's wrong with me?

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,080
Why are there so many stars?

170
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
Sorry, sir.

171
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
I hurt you just now.

172
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,120
Look at you.

173
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Watch where you're going.

174
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,080
Are you okay?

175
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,560
Blood.

176
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,560
Blood, I'm sorry.

177
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,240
I'm really sorry.

178
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,920
Why am I so careless

179
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,440
fall down?

180
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,440
Miss.

181
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,880
If you fall down,

182
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,360
I'll die for it.

183
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,680
Are you okay?

184
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,080
I'm fine.

185
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,720
I'm fine.

186
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,000
Miss.

187
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,480
Where do you live?

188
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
Are you married?

189
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,800
I...

190
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,040
Praise Ngoh. Are you leaving or not?

191
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,520
Praise Ngoh.

192
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,800
Remember.

193
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,160
You are now a maid of the Shen family.

194
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,800
Don't hang out with an indecent man.
