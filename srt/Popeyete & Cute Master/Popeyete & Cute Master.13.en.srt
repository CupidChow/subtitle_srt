1
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,840
I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

2
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,960
I've fulfilled my promise.

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,280
to help you find him.

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,880
Don't forget me

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
you'll forget me.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,320
You should know

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,440
protecting my life

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
is your first duty.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,160
Also,

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
I promised to help you build the Great God Temple.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,040
But it depends on your performance.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,160
Do you hear me?

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,760
Yes.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,600
Does your butt still hurt?

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
Do you want me to show you?

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,320
No.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,960
Don't touch me.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,400
No need.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,000
Bad news, Young Master.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,000
Come back!

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:02,920
What are you doing?

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,000
How reckless.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,320
Young master, this note...

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,720
What note?

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,880
Shen Wang.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,920
At midnight tomorrow

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
outside the west gate,

28
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,520
See you in the woods.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know which girl

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,840
wants to go on a date with me.

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,760
See?

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
This is my charm.

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
You misunderstood, Young Master.

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,360
It's not a girl.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,440
The kidnapper's wife was kidnapped.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,479
What did you say?

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,800
Please bless me

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,280
to renew the incense for the Shen family.

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,080
The merciful Guanyin Bodhisattva.

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,440
Wang is stingy,

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,240
but he's a good kid.

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
Please bless him and Ngoh

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,400
to have a grandchild for the Shen family.

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,400
Thank you

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,800
Who are you?

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,760
Come and help!

48
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,680
Where are you going?

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,840
Let go of me. I want to save my mother.

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
But the note says midnight.

51
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,640
What are you going to do now?

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,560
At midnight.

53
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,640
Got it.

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,560
What's going on?

55
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,880
Master,

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,800
we kidnapped Shen Wang's mother.

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,880
We're exhausted.

58
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,160
You two idiots!

59
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,200
How dare you tie Shen Wang up!

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Why did you tie his mother up?

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,320
Master.

62
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,320
The maid beside Shen Wang

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,960
is good at martial arts.

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,840
I tried many times but failed.

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,720
Now that I think about it,

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
I can't return empty-handed.

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,760
I want to kill his mother first

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
and then come up with another plan.

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,560
Tie up his mother and talk about a plan.

70
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Open the sack.

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Who are you?

72
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,440
My surname is Wei.

73
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,560
My first name is Zhong.

74
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,400
A fairy descends to the mortal world.

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
May I know your name?

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
My surname is Liu. My first name is Juan.

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
What a special name.

78
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,800
Master

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,200
What's so special about Liu Juan?

80
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,240
The servants won't do anything to scare you.

81
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,440
It's okay.

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,120
Sometimes something

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,440
is not necessarily a bad thing.

84
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,079
Just call me Juan. Don't call me Madam.

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
I'm still young.

86
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
Okay, madam.

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,320
Wait, Juan, you can leave.

88
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,840
Since you're here, why don't you invite me?

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,120
Madam.

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,520
Juan, let's talk inside.

91
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,360
Boss.

92
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,040
Are you in love?

93
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,200
Brother.

94
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,640
What happened to Master?

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,320
We finally got Shen Wang's mother here.

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
and now he's sending her back.

97
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,040
Stop talking.

98
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,440
Hurry up and lift it. It's quite heavy.

99
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,680
Why is she so heavy?

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm so tired.

101
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,800
All right, keep moving.

102
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,440
Brother.

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Wait for me!

104
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,280
Untie me.

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,920
Mother.

106
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,960
Are you okay?

107
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,680
Son.

108
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,080
Let me tell you.

109
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
I feel so happy.

110
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Happy?

111
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,640
Mother.

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,680
Mother.

113
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,960
Why do you smell like alcohol?

114
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,520
Tell me why you kidnapped my mother.

115
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,320
I won't say anything.

116
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,920
He's dead.

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,000
He's dead!

118
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
Shen Wang.

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,960
Surprised?

120
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,000
I prepared a blood capsule in advance.

121
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm so smart.

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,640
This is a brilliant move.

123
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,360
He thought he escaped,

124
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
he returned to their lair

125
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,160
back to their lair.

126
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,080
In this way,

127
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,200
we can find out

128
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
to find out their origin.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,720
I didn't expect that although you're weak,

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,160
but you're quite smart.

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,360
Who are you calling weak?

132
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,240
You.

133
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,840
I don't want to talk to you.

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,800
Let's go.

135
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,800
The kidnapper's lair is in the brothel.

136
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Flower yard?

137
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,880
It looks familiar.

138
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,159
What?

139
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
You don't even remember

140
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,200
You don't remember?

141
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,040
Go in.

142
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,760
Yes.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,520
Where are you going?

144
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,640
We need further consideration.

145
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,680
Follow me.

146
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,160
Failure again and again.

147
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,960
Shen Wang.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,480
A weak boy

149
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
Is it so hard to tie him up?

150
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,800
Boss is not our fault this time.

151
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,000
It's all Shen Wang's fault.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
by Shen Chong

153
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,360
defeated ten of them.

154
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
I can't resist it.

155
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
He tricked us several times.

156
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Since we can't beat her,

157
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,480
get rid of that girl first

158
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,560
and kidnap Shen Wang.

159
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,560
Okay.

160
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,159
I made some money again.

161
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,560
Long time no see, Granny.

162
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,800
I...

163
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,880
I admit defeat. I'll give you all the money.

164
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,400
Let me go.

165
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,680
You're welcome.

166
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,440
Business has been good lately.

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
I need your help.

168
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
Shen Wang, are you okay?

169
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
Shut up.

170
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,200
The new goods Mrs. Chen brought this time

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,160
is really good.

172
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Well...

173
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,720
She's small

174
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,280
and cute.

175
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,280
Many customers like this.

176
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,600
What's your name?

177
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm Ngoh.

178
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,480
My name is Xu.

179
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,600
Xu.

180
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,680
This name sounds nice.

181
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,360
What a sweet boy.

182
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
With your temper,

183
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,920
our customers will like it.

184
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,520
This

185
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
What a beauty.

186
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,960
What's your name?

187
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,560
Say something.

188
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,280
Little maid.

189
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,400
Little maid.

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,320
Ordinary.

191
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,840
I think

192
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,960
I'll call you Rou.

193
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,680
Get up and follow me.

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,760
I'll clean you up first.
