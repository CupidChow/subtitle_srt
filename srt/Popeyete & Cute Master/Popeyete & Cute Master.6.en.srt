1
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,480
What should we say if Shen Wang runs away again?

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,360
Where is Shen Wang?

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,040
I’ll kill him.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,240
Master.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:27,960
Well...

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,040
Shen Wang ran away.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,240
What?

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
You losers!

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,360
You failed again and again.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,680
Aren't you ashamed?

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,240
Master Shen Wang has a helper.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,760
Kill them too.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,480
I said you're good at praising Ngoh.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,360
I've been attacked more than ten times.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,240
I never got hurt.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
I hired you to protect me.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:56,920
And then?

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm the one who gets hurt.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
Don't be angry. How can I not be angry?

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,280
I'll give you 20 points.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,000
Dr. Jia Yao.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
You're finally here.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,400
How is it?

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,920
Do you feel it?

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,440
Does it still hurt?

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,280
No.

27
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,720
Dr. Jia.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,039
You're indeed a fake doctor.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,720
He injured his other leg.

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
You don't understand.

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,680
I'm afraid there will be a transfer.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,880
It hurts now.

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,600
Look. It's not moving. It's moving. It's moving. It's moving. It's moving. It's moving. It's moving. It's moving. It's moving. It's moving.

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,880
It's not moving.

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Looks like his toes are in the wrong position.

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,759
I'll set him up and fix it.

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,479
This disease

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,280
can't be cured in ten or half months.

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,920
I'll give you a prescription.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,920
Just take the medicine according to this prescription.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Okay, I'll take my leave.

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,400
So much money.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
150 taels.

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,240
I didn't control my strength.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Is that the point?

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,400
The point is

48
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,360
for a man

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
You stepped on me and stepped on me.

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,760
Nonsense.

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,840
We've known each other for more than ten years.

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,520
Pay me.

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,200
Medical fee, mental damage and labor loss.

54
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,880
I'll charge you 150 taels.

55
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,440
Your salary is not enough.

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,160
You're ungrateful.

57
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
I helped you in your dream just now.

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,760
Are you blaming me for this?

59
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,680
Is this a trivial matter?

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,920
How about this?

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,520
You...

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,960
Stay and take care of me.

63
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,400
It depends on your performance.

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,320
I'm very considerate.

65
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
Ngoh's beauty.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,360
My painting brush is hard to describe what if.

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
The octopus in Guanguan

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,360
On the riverside,

69
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,320
Thank you, Ngoh.

70
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,880
I'm very lucky.

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,520
Ngoh.

72
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,079
So beautiful!

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Ngoh.

74
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,200
Sister.

75
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,400
What are you doing?

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,079
Practice drawing.

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,480
Let me see.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,680
It's not good.

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,440
How can I get into your eyes?

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,280
It hurts.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,600
Sister.

82
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,440
Can you

83
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,040
Don't pinch my ear like when I was a kid.

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,880
Gorilla drew well.

85
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,840
What gorilla?

86
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,640
This is Ngoh.

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,320
What?

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,600
Ngoh.

89
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,280
You heard it wrong.

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,040
I said I drew a goose.

91
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,280
Where did you meet such an indecent woman?

92
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,440
Even if it's you,

93
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,760
I can't insult Ngoh.

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,519
Just like a fairy in the sky,

95
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,240
I fell in love at first sight.

96
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
You said you weren't an indecent woman.

97
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,040
You...

98
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
can only marry a noble lady.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to marry Ngoh.

100
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,760
You...

101
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
Jin Mantang, let me tell you.

102
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,840
Our family is rich.

103
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,640
Many people are watching.

104
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
You can only marry a noble lady.

105
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll arrange a blind date for you tomorrow.

106
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,040
At noon tomorrow,

107
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,159
at the pavilion in our backyard.

108
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,640
Don't be late.

109
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,800
Got it?

110
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Is the medicine ready?

111
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,440
Let me help you.

112
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,280
Help! Fire!

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,640
I'm sorry

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
I didn't mean it

115
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,800
What?

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,600
Dust in the pot.

117
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,400
This is the decoction for you.

118
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,080
You're welcome.

119
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
Do I look like I'm being polite to you?

120
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,480
Make me another bowl.

121
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,840
Wait.

122
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,480
Don't go.

123
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,640
Don't waste the medicine.

124
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,880
Young master

125
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,560
Young master, the kitchen made this especially for you.

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,640
for your health.

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,680
You can leave now.

128
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,680
Praise Ngoh.

129
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,520
Feed me some porridge.

130
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
Do you want to scald me to death?

131
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,680
Feed me when it's cold.

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,920
It's still a little hot.

133
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,360
I...

134
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,040
It's hot.

135
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,200
Shen Wang.

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
I've found my little brother.

137
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,360
I'm very grateful to you.

138
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,200
Of course you should thank me.

139
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,159
By the way,

140
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,560
Is he the person you're looking for?

141
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,480
You still need to be tested.

142
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,200
I think it's almost done.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Shen Wang, before I came to Riyao City,

144
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,720
I swore in front of Guru Kuao E.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,280
as soon as I find him,

146
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,480
I'll go back and repair the temple for him.

147
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,360
Can you help me?

148
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,560
Don't mention Kuao E.

149
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,400
He tortures me every night.

150
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,480
He wants me to fix the temple for him.

151
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,440
Impossible.

152
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
How many times have I told you

153
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,400
The one chasing you in your dream

154
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,080
is not Kuao E at all.

155
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,640
Stop it.

156
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm fine now.

157
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,080
Thanks to you,

158
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,520
I can't run anymore.

159
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,560
Shen Wang.

160
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,920
Tonight,

161
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,480
I'll show you

162
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
the real Kuao E.

163
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,480
I ate it all.

164
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
What are you waiting for?

165
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,200
Go cook another bowl for me.

166
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm sorry

167
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
I'll cook it for you in the kitchen.

168
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,520
Praise Ngoh.

169
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,240
I hope you can serve me.

170
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,880
I'll let you take care of me sooner or later.

171
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,280
Master, you are so nice.

172
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Shen Wangran away and bought us roasted duck.

173
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,720
Shen Wang, your money will be mine sooner or later.

174
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,240
What are you doing?

175
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,240
Let's sleep together.

176
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,960
I'll show you Guru Kuao E.

177
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,600
Look at me now.

178
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,640
Forget it.

179
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,600
It's okay.

180
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
My leg is not well.

181
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Trust me.

182
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,720
Your leg is fine.

183
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,720
Forget it. I'm not in the mood.

184
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,480
Don't worry.

185
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,000
Leave it to me.

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,039
What are you looking at?

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,799
Go to sleep.

188
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,000
Lie down.

189
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,360
Don't worry.

190
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Straighten your legs.

191
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,160
