1
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,120
It smells good.

2
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,440
Miss.

3
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,600
Have a new sugar figurine.

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,280
How much is one?

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
35 copper cash for one.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,680
Come on.

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,520
Young lady,

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,760
It's your first time here, right?

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,360
How did you know?

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,040
I've lived here for decades.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,240
I know clearly

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,640
I know it clearly.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
You look unfamiliar.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,880
Granny,

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,120
can you find someone for me?

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,000
Sure.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,760
Grandma.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Do you know whose dessert is from?

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
I do know

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,280
I know.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:09,920
Really.

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,720
If you trust me,

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,720
come with me.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,480
Thank you, Granny. Let's go.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,600
This way.

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,520
Come out.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:37,920
Give it to me.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,640
Tie her up.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,160
Stop!

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,240
Lang Lang Gankun!

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,880
How dare you kidnap a girl?

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,680
Tie him up too.

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,800
How dare you!

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,440
Behave. I'll kill you.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,200
Bet.

36
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,360
I wonder who Shen Wang offended.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
He has been attacked 18 times.

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,759
They are still alive and kicking.

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,440
Kidnappiners nowadays are so unprofessional.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,160
No wonder Shen Wang can become the richest man.

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,240
I'll be the richest man in Shen Wang sooner or later.

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,880
Behave yourself! Let me go! Get in!

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,120
Let go of me!

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,640
Go in.

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Go in.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,400
How dare you!

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,800
How dare you kidnap a woman in broad daylight?

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,320
Do you know who I am?

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Who cares?

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
You're so nosy.

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,079
Look how obedient she is.

52
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,800
Granny.

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,520
Is he here?

54
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,240
The guy you're looking for isn't here.

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,120
But

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,440
there are many old men here.

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
Let's go to the boss.

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,600
Wait.

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you mean?

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,480
What do you mean?

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,320
I'm kidnapping you to sell money.

62
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,680
You...

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,720
How many times have I told you?

64
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,600
You don't believe me?

65
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,840
How dare you lie to me to praise Ngoh?

66
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,640
Take this!

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,840
You're leaving just like that?

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
I'm here.

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,440
Get up.

70
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,280
Not bad.

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,760
Fortunately, he left us one.

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,760
You won't end up well.

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,800
Shut up!

74
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,200
You talk too much.

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,240
Come on, pull me.

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,280
Get up.

77
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,520
Did I forget something?

78
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,640
You know to come back?

79
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,640
Sorry.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,920
I forgot you.

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,480
Stop explaining.

82
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,400
Untie me.

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,360
Let's go.

84
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Please enjoy.

85
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,640
Ngoh.

86
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,200
Help yourself.

87
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,600
My treat.

88
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
You're too plain.

89
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:25,920
Here.

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,320
Try the secret spicy sauce I praised Ngoh.

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,520
No, no, no.

92
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,640
Don't mention it.

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,120
Well...

94
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,280
The customer said

95
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
you've had over 30 bowls of wontons

96
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,480
Can you pay the bill first?

97
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,880
Hey, waiter.

98
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,640
Are you looking down on me?

99
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,440
Do we look like we don't pay?

100
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,240
Oh no.

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,280
I think I left my wallet in the garden.

102
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Sir,

103
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,000
I was a little rude just now.

104
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,240
Well...

105
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,320
I have a question.

106
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,640
if our shop

107
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,240
on credit?

108
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,120
Eating indecent food?

109
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,320
It's a misunderstanding

110
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,360
It's not a free meal.

111
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,200
It's on credit.

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
Look at my face carefully.

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,640
Is it familiar?

114
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,920
Yes.

115
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,280
I am the richest man in Ilyao City.

116
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Shen Wang.

117
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,560
That's even worse.

118
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,920
I heard that Shen Wang

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,480
He won't pay the money back.

120
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,560
Look at you.

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,440
Shen Wang.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
It's wrong not to pay.

123
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,920
When can we find him?

124
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,880
There are 25 bowls left.

125
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
Don't sleep if you can't finish them.

126
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,280
Shen Wang.

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,920
It's not shameful to have no money.

128
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,480
But you have to pretend to be rich.

129
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,360
That's not right.

130
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,040
I didn't...

131
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,320
Fine.

132
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,560
I have no money.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,720
You also have a praising of the God of E.

134
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,760
What do you mean?

135
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,920
Let me tell you.

136
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,760
This praising the god of Ao is very evil.

137
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,680
He just gave me less money.

138
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,440
and you're asking me for money.

139
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,720
He's a greedy man.

140
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,920
What did you say?

141
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,720
Praise the God of E.

142
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,320
never greedy for money.

143
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,280
Fine.

144
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,480
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

145
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,400
Pay me.

146
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Brothel porcelain jade plate.

147
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,160
The market price is 15 copper cash.

148
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,640
into your debts.

149
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Now you have to wash

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,000
268 bowls.

151
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,080
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,560
I was too angry just now.

153
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,080
I didn't control my strength.

154
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,400
Miss,

155
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,560
How about

156
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
Let's sit over there.

157
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,760
Come on.

158
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
Take a rest here.

159
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
I can do

160
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,520
alone.

161
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,360
Are you sure?

162
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,520
Yes.

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,800
Young Master has found it.

164
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,080
What did you say?

165
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,480
The young master got deducted from eating indecent food.

166
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,040
He was washing dishes with a girl.

167
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,000
to pay the debt.

168
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,159
Say it again.

169
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,560
Eldest Young Master is having a bossy meal.

170
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,800
The last line.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,760
Wash the dishes.

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,880
The first line.

173
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Eldest Young Master was deducted from eating indecent meals.

174
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
I mean the sentence with the little girl.

175
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,840
Little girl.

176
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,920
My son who has been single for ten thousand years

177
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,120
went to find a girl.

178
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,040
Don't disturb them.

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,120
Let him go on a date with the girl.

180
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,520
and find a chance to set them up.

181
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,320
Okay.

182
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,320
That little brat.

183
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,240
Shen Wang is so lucky.

184
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,039
There was a little girl in the middle.

185
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,400
It's my work injury.

186
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,200
I don't want to kidnap him anymore.

187
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
As you wish.

188
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm going to kill you! Hey!

189
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,880
Well...

190
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,320
I said I was bald.

191
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,600
That profiteer Shen Wang

192
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
hurt me again and again.

193
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm not a gentleman unless I take revenge.

194
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,080
