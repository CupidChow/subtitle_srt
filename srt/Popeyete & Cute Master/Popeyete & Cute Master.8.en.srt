1
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,920
He's going on a blind date soon.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,600
meet.

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,680
Should I dress up?

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,160
But I don't know how.

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,960
Miss.

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,080
Do you know how to dress up?

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,400
Ngoh, you're too polite.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,120
Are you going on a date with Young Master?

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,120
Something like that.

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm good at dressing up.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,920
Miss, let me help you.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,760
Let's go.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,320
Young Master.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,920
If you really don't want

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,120
let Ngoh meet that Jin Mantang,

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,760
I can give you a suggestion.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,640
You can tell her directly.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
What do you suggest?

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,039
She can meet whoever she wants.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,600
It has nothing to do with me.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
What are you waiting for so early?

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,920
Can't I come out to get some fresh air?

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,280
But Young Master, the sun

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,320
It's just the two of us.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,520
She's here.

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,200
There is a beauty in the north who is unique and independent.

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,840
Her eyebrows are as far as a mountain.

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,560
The lip is like cinnabar, but the lip is flat.

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,400
Beautiful.

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
So-so

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
You look like a woman.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,720
Young Master, you're so stubborn.

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,120
Ngoh looks so pretty.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
What a pity.

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,079
Ngoh looks so pretty

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,640
to meet another man.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,480
Young Master.

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,040
I feel sorry for him.

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Zhao Cai, Jin Bao,

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,040
From now on,

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,240
you two

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,640
will be deducted for the next half of the year.

43
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,960
You two, get out of my sight!

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,440
Get lost!

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,920
Go away.

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,200
Wait.

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,680
Push me back to my room.

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,720
Look.

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,400
You can't live without us.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,880
I can't live without you.

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,760
Tell me.

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,120
she's my maid, right?

53
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,240
I

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,920
wouldn't ignore her.

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,520
With her IQ,

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,360
was sold by Jin Mantang.

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,120
I have to count money for him happily.

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,840
Why can't I go?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
Why should I listen to her?

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,040
I want to see what happened.

61
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,840
Zhao Cai.

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Young Master.

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,160
Young Master.

64
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Where is he?

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,240
He won't come.

66
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,680
How did you know?

67
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,800
Are you his blind date?

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
Looks like our plan has been exposed.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
I knew it was you

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,560
seduced my brother.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,000
How dare you disobey me and refuse blind dates?

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,880
So you're his sister.

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,080
We're a family.

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
Sit down and rest.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm not your sister.

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,320
You loser.

77
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,360
Do you want some cakes

78
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,840
This is my favorite.

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,280
Don't think I'll like you just because you're nice to me.

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,400
My brother is handsome and talented.

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,200
He's the only heir to the restaurant.

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,360
My future sister-in-law

83
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,680
must be from a noble family.

84
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
I won't let you in

85
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,040
I will never let you in.

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Why are you talking so much?

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,600
Do you want some water?

88
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
Get lost if you have money.

89
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,800
Who told my fiancee to get lost?

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,240
How arrogant!

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,080
Aren't you afraid that your tongue will get hurt?

92
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,880
Shen Wang.

93
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,120
Go over there.

94
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,240
So noisy.

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,680
Why are you shouting so loudly?

96
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
You're crippled. Why don't you behave?

97
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,480
Who told you to come out?

98
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,800
That's right.

99
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm praising Ngoh's fiance.

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,280
Shen Wang, the richest man in Ilyao City.

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,440
No.

102
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,000
Shut up.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
You're the best bachelor

104
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
who makes the most money in Ilyo City.

105
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,720
A lucky cloud came from the sky when he was born.

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,960
Read poems at four.

107
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,840
He calculated when he was five.

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,120
I knew medicine when I was six.

109
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
I bought mine at seven.

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,360
and earn money all the way.

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,640
and bring glory to the Shen family.

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,280
You're right.

113
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
I am the handsome

114
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,400
handsome and talented.

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,320
Shen Wang.

116
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,640
You've been gifted since you were young.

117
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
Why didn’t you tell me?

118
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,560
Mr. Shen.

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
My name is Jin Yu'er.

120
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,840
You can call me Yu'er.

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,480
This is my address.

122
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,159
Keep in touch.

123
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,120
Miss Jin.

124
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,480
No need.

125
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,600
I hate it.

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,240
What do you think?

127
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,280
Have you seen my charm?

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
What are you doing?

129
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,600
You're so nice.

130
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
He even left me the address.

131
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,240
That way, it'll be more convenient for me to find him.

132
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,800
I mean praising Ngoh.

133
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,600
There's no one else in your eyes

134
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,560
except this little brother, right?

135
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,360
There's no one else here.

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,360
You're heartless.

137
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,920
Are you okay?

138
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,840
Don't act tough. Your foot hasn't recovered yet.

139
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,200
How can you get off the bed?

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,600
How dare you say that?

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,720
If it weren't for you,

142
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,760
I wouldn't be so miserable.

143
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,680
and lied that I was your fiancee.

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,720
You scared the little brother's sister away.

145
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,600
Praise Ngoh.

146
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,840
I found that not only are you heartless,

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,520
but also your eyes.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
He scolded you.

149
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,640
but you still serve her tea.

150
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,920
Besides,

151
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,120
I bought

152
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
I bought you these desserts.

153
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,159
Why did you give them to her but not me?

154
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
So this is what you care about.

155
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,120
I'll give you one.

156
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,240
Take it away. I don't want it.

157
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm not eating.

158
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,000
Why are you still eating?

159
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,400
I bought it.

160
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,280
