3
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,680
Of course.

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,920
Stop fighting!

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,320
I'm hurt.

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,440
Who has the medicine?

7
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,440
Master.

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,720
Are you okay?

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
I didn't mean it.

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,360
You didn't do it on purpose.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,000
You pricked my head.

12
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,320
Ngoh.

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,960
I'm here to save you.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,280
Master, I'm leaving.

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,120
I won't abandon you. Don't worry.

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,520

17
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,000
Ngoh.

18

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,960

20
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,080

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,479
I'm targeting you.

22
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,720
I just want to surpass you.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,520

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm so handsome,

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,560
but I can't.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,680

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600

28

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,479

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,520

37

Mother, I'm fine now.

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,120
By the way, Mother,

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
do you remember

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,040
when I was young?

41
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,600
I remember.

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,400
You said in a mountain,

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,680
you were kidnapped by a strong female demon.

44
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,640
and insisted on letting you be her husband.

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
You came back in fear.

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,960
You fainted after that.

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,040
When you wake up,

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,760
you won't remember anything.

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,120
Dali female monster.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,200

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,600
Ngoh, listen to me. Stop right there!

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
I didn't say that, right, Mother? Don't run!

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,160
Shen Wang!

54
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
Ngoh, let me explain.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,160
Our young master is a strict wife.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,320
With Ngoh's strength,

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,160
Whoever marries will be strictly disciplined.

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,800

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
I didn't say that. Don't run.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,920
Ngoh.

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,400
Looks like Shen Wang

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,320
You're right.

64

Sometimes

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,520

66
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,760
Sometimes,

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,840
men should choose to let go.

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,360
Ngoh.

69
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,920

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,200

Mr. Shen,

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,640
I’ll always remember you.

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,159
We're both in the same boat.

79
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,120
Don't be sad.

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,560
Look.

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,760
This is the blind date arrangement

82
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,080
or next month.

83
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,680
No.

84
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,040
No, no, no.

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,640
You have to use the sadness of heartbreak as power.

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,920
and get married soon.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,080

89

Be strong.

90

91

94
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
Shen Wang, thank you.

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Thank you for repairing the Great God Temple.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,240
I should thank you.

97
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,520
Without you,

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,280
I wouldn't be who I am now.

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,840
Ngoh.

100
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,240
