1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,440
Please bless Ngoh. Please bless Ngoh.

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,720
Please bless Ngoh.

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,120
If you find the little brother,

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,479
I'll rebuild the temple for you when I return.

5
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,560
and burn incense for you.

6
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,039
In this world,

7
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,800
only this spending money

8
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,759
can make me truly happy.

9
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,360
Who sent you here?

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,200
Why do you keep picking on me?

11
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,800
Zhao Cai and Jin Bao kicked him out.

12
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm the descendant of the God of Ao.

13
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,520
Praise Ngoh?

14
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,800
My child foster husband.

15
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,240
has been waiting for me for many years.

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,320
I can't let him wait alone anymore.

17
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,160
Yoyo City! I'm here!

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,400
By the way,

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,600
we praised the descendants

20
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,480
have a skill.

21
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
He was born with divine power.

22
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,200
A fake priest

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,320
How dare you cheat the money of Shen Wang, the richest man in Ilyao City?

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,640
I got up so early.

25
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,240
Jin Bao.

26
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
How is it going?

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,080
Don't worry, Young Master.

28
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
I've already carried Madam

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,640
with the money in the box.

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
Remember to bring the box back.

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,720
These are top-quality yellow pear wood.

32
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,520
Young Master is wise.

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,120
But if we do this,

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,240
be disrespectful

35
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
and upgrade the curse?

36
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,320
All curse upgrades are illusions.

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,160
Instead of giving 5,000 taels of silver

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
to these monks,

39
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,560
it's better to hire a martial artist

40
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,320
to kill the mastermind as soon as possible.

41
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,520
Old man.

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,079
How dare you!

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
Stop! You owe me protection fee!

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Bring me the 20 taels today.

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,560
It's not open today. I don't have it.

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,480
Not now

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
I really don't have 20 taels.

48
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,320
Do you want to die?

49
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,760
Stop! Stop!

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,760
Where did you come from?

51
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,680
Good job.

52
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
You're so pretty.

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,120
Come with me.

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,080
Let's go.

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
It's quite powerful.

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,480
What are you waiting for?

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,000
Go help them.

58
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:20,839
Watch out!

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,400
Are you

60
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,159
with them?

61
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,600
No, no, no.

62
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,520
Isn't this the martial arts master who came to us?

63
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
Why are you following me?

64
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
You're brave and brave.

65
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,640
I really admire you.

66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,080
It's my duty.

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,760
Everyone says so.

68
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,120
May I know your name?

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,520
Where do you live? How old are you?

70
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,640
where I came from.

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,320
What do you like to eat?

72
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,920
Is there any place

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,000
to use?

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
If not,

75
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,200
we can be friends.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,560
You asked too much.

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,480
Say it again.

78
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
I mean,

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
I want to make friends with you.

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
with you every day.

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,760
without mentioning money.

82
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,720
Heroine.

83
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,000
Shen Wang, stop!

84
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,440
Run!

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Stop!

86
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,120
Shen Wang, don't run! Help me!

87
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,680
Watch out!

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,440
Help!

89
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,760
Help!

90
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,680
What's wrong with him?

91
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,120
You don't know.

92
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,000
This is a psychological problem of our young master.

93
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,880
What?

94
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,280
Not long ago,

95
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,600
our young master donated some money

96
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,880
I thought a little bit,

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,240
That's what happened.

98
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,920
Donating donations to the god of Aoe.

99
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,600
Why didn't I know?

100
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
There's a priest in the back temple village.

101
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
Our young master donated a box.

102
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,200
Stone.

103
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,400
He's been like this since he came back.

104
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,840
Our Young Master...

105
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,800
Someone wants to catch him when he's awake.

106
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,920
He has to run.

107
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,680
He's asleep.

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,360
God wants to catch him.

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,360
He has to run.

110
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,200
He runs every day and night.

111
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,600
We all call him Runnan.

112
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,760
Don't catch me.

113
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,720
Don't catch me.

114
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,360
You're awake.

115
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,080
Where is the kidnapper?

116
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
He was beaten away by the heroine.

117
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,159
He ran away.

118
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,200
Heroine.

119
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,800
Thank you for saving me.

120
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,800
No, no, no.

121
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,360
Package.

122
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,480
Get the parcel for the heroine.

123
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,840
Come on. What are you doing?

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,880
No.

125
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,760
I'm going to find someone in Ilyao City.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're going to Yoyo City?

127
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,720
What a coincidence.

128
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm staying in Riyao City.

129
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,960
I can give you a ride.

130
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
Are you going to Ilyao City?

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,160
Yes.

132
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,480
That's great. You're a good person.

133
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,440
Thank you.

134
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,160
Who are you looking for in Riyao City?

135
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
Maybe I can help you.

136
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,400
What is this?

137
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,039
It's a jade pendant.

138
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,120
Bracelet.

139
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,040
What's this smell?

140
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,320
It's Chinese medicine.

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
Are you looking for a doctor?

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,280
I guess you can't help me.

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,760
You don't even know snacks?

144
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,520
This is dessert.

145
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
I've kept it for ten years.

146
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,280
It's the only clue I found.

147
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,440
The only clue?

148
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,400
I think

149
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,760
you should give up.

150
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,120
We're almost there.

151
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,120
Thank you.

152
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,840
I need to hurry up and find the boy.

153
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,680
Stop!

154
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,560
I want to get off.

155
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,680
Hey.

156
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,920
Where is he?

157
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,640
Search over there.

158
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,640
You...

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,600
Look over there.
