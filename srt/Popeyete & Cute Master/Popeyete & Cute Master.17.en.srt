1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,320
He's here. He's here.

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,280
I don't know.

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,240
I really don't know.

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,600
Ngoh.

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,320
Shen Wang.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,240
It hurts.

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,360
It hurts.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
I didn't use my strength.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,920
You didn't?

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,000
Maybe

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,560
Kuan E saw your sincerity.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,240
It might not help you regain your power.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,240
Really?

14
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:15,800
Nonsense.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,039
Not at all.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,240
You were acting, weren't you?

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,440
Ngoh.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,120
Think carefully.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,400
This is your dream.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,160
Do whatever you want.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,160
Didn't you say

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,280
as long as you are pure and kind,

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,160
you can control your dream.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,759
But I always feel

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,880
I feel sorry for Kua Ngoh.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,160
Besides,

27
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,120
What's the use of regaining my power in a dream?

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,160
Why not?

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,320
Have you forgotten?

30
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,000
how you saved me in your dream?

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
From the sky.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,440
That pose is so impressive.

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,920
Shen Wang.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,480
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,440
I can't protect you with my power.

36
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,600
Praise Ngoh.

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
Why are you sorry?

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,640
Actually, I think

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,360
your power

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,240
doesn't work at all.

41
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,840
Why?

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,079
Think about it. Before you showed up,

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
these bad guys kidnapped me

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,680
didn't succeed, right?

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,079
Then you showed up.

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,200
At most,

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,040
we'll use your power to fight back.

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,840
But the effect is not very good.

49
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,480
We failed so many times.

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
What does it mean?

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,760
Explain?

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,320
What does it mean?

53
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,720
It means I'm lucky.

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
With the support of luck,

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,760
I'll be invincible.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,840
Don't worry.

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,920
By then,

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,320
I can protect you with my good luck.

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,880
After I

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,280
those annoying guys,

61
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,080
I'll help you rebuild the Great God Temple.

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
and build a bigger and luxurious one.

63
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,920
By the way, I'll make you a statue.

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,720
It's called praising Ngoh.

65
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,400
Don't talk nonsense.

66
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Winter is listening.

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,960
Besides, we haven't found him yet.

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,720
It's not time to fix the temple.

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,400
He has to fix it no matter what.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If he dies,

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
you won't fulfill your wish.

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
You're talking nonsense again.

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,720
Your little brother is dead.

74
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,640
Fine, fine, fine.

75
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,920
Don't worry.

76
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,079
I'll find him no matter what.

77
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,079
Did I hear it right?

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Mr. Shen

79
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,280
would end up like this.

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,880
You want to learn to make cakes from me?

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Cut the crap.

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,640
Will you teach me or not?

83
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Call me grandpa.

84
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,440
In your dreams.

85
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,280
No.

86
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,120
Forget it.

87
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,640
In that case,

88
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
I used to be the chef of Japan City,

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,360
by Fang Boqing.

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,920
The lone copy.

91
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,720
Since you don't want it,

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I can only...

93
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,160
Mr. Shen, let’s talk.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Mr. Shen.

95
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,840
What do you want to learn?

96
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,360
Shen Wang.

97
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,240
That's salty salt not flour

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,280
You can't put chili in the dessert

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,680
What's that smell

100
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,520
The stove is going to explode.

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,080
What are you doing?

102
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,840
Ngoh, I made this for you myself.

103
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,840
your favorite trophy pastry.

104
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,440
Try it.

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,400
I'll eat later.

106
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,080
I have two more clothes to wash.

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,720
I'm done.

108
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Try it.

109
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,320
I...

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
I'm afraid it might poison me.

111
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Poison you to death? Don't exaggerate.

112
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,120
You really don't want to eat?

113
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,800
I'll eat it then.

114
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,560
This taste is really...

115
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Shen Wang, don't be discouraged.

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,320
My mother said

117
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,320
everyone has their own strengths

118
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,480
and something they're not good at.

119
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,960
Maybe you're not good at cooking.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When praising the god of Ao closes a door for you,

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,280
he will open a window for you.

122
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,800
Don't argue with yourself.

123
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,960
There are so many principles.

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,920
Why doesn't it work on you?

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,480
I...

126
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,920
Ngoh.

127
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,080
You don't have much strength now.

128
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,600
but you still have to push yourself.

129
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
to live like before.

130
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,600
Just like me

131
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,200
You're not good at cooking,

132
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,000
but he still made you dessert.

133
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
That's different.

134
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,160
How?

135
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,880
It's all about making myself unhappy.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
Why bother others?

137
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,280
Didn't you just say

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
that once the God of Aoe closes a door for you,

139
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,360
you'll open another window.

140
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,080
I believe

141
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,159
even without great strength,

142
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,120
you can still live a wonderful life.

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,960
It turns out that you came all the way

144
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,520
to comfort me.

145
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Thank you, Shen Wang.

146
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,680
I didn't figure it out.

147
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,920
It's really good

148
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,760
like this.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,480
Ngoh, open the melon with bare hands.

150
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,240
Okay.

151
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,760
Applause.

152
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,400
Come on.

153
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,680
I'll share it with you.

154
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Which one do you want?

155
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,600
This one.

156
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
Thank you, Ngoh.

157
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,320
You're welcome.

158
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,520
Ngoh.

159
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,400
Kylin!

160
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,000
Mr. Jin.

161
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,400
On the day of the festival,

162
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,600
why did you and Shen Wang

163
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,640
disappear in a blink of an eye?

164
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,320
Well, it's a long story.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I feel that after you asked me the question that day,

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
you became very cold to me.

167
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,840
I think it's too late

168
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
if I don't say it now.

169
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,960
Ngoh.

170
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,160
Do you know I like you?

171
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,480
No, no, no.

172
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,440
you like me.

173
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,040
Yes.

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,520
The first time I met you,

175
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,360
the first time I saw you.

176
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,400
Ngoh.

177
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,880
What about you? What do you think of me?

178
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,240
I don't like you.

180
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,080
Ngoh.

181
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,880
Who exactly do you like?

182
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,760
Could it be that damn Shen Wang?

183
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,039
I knew it.

184
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,440
he had feelings for you.

185
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,559
It's all my fault.

186
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
Mr. Jin, calm down.

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Shen Wang said

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,120
he doesn't like girls from the countryside like me.

189
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,640
Ngoh.

190
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,200
You're too naive.

191
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,640
This is

192
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,400
Shen Wang, that playboy.

193
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,680
He said he didn’t like you.

194
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,920
and lower your guard.

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,840
and then try to get close to you.

196
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,080

The water drips through the stone.

198
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
He's so sinister.

199
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,560
Are you saying this to prove

200
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,360
Shen Wang really likes me.

201
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,640
Mr. Jin, cry first.

202
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,080
I'm taking Ngoh home.

203
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,160
Let's go home.

204
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,440
Ngoh.

205
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,520
Praise Ngoh.

206
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Jin Mantang is not the boy you're looking for.

207
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,400
Stay away from him.

208
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,400
Shen Wang, are you jealous?

209
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,160
I'm not jealous.

210
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,920
Because you like me.

211
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Mr. Jin said

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,440
you must like me.

213
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,960
You didn't admit it because you wanted to trick me.

214
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,440
That's right.

215
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,160
I'm just jealous. So what?

216
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,600
You really like me.

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
But didn't you say you like a noble lady?

218
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,680
It's good to be a noble lady.

219
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,920
You can praise Ngoh better.

220
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,160
Didn't I tell you?

221
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,360
it doesn't matter without Dali.

222
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
When you help someone in trouble,

223
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,920
you're sparkling.

224
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,680
I miss you when I can't see you for two hours.

225
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
I'm so angry

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
makes me angry.

227
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
When I see you with another man,

228
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
when I see you with another man.

229
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,560
Praise Ngoh.

230
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,960
I like you.

231
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
I like you very much.

232
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,080
Who stepped on my foot?

233
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,360
Don't push me. I can't see it.

234
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,600
Ngoh.
