Episode 3

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Tsukimiya-san...

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I won't accept this ending...

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Tsukimiya-san...

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She's alive...

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She's alive...

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Was it really good?

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What are you doing?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's Wada-no-san!

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Tsukimiya-san suddenly...

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Seiseki!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Who are you?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What? Wait, what are you saying?

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Anken!

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Be quiet, you suspicious person!

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Tsumago-kun, why are you on stage?

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, I just happened to be on stage.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Just happened to be on stage?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Tsukimiya-san, it's me!

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Marihira Takeru!

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Takeru? I don't know him.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He doesn't remember me?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Tsukimiya-san...

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry...

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry...

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry...

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry...

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry...

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000

I'm sorry...

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry...

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry...

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry...

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry...

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry...

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry...

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry...

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry...

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry...

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry...

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry...

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry...

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry...

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry...

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry...

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry...

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry...

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry...

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry...

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry...

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry...

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry...

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry...

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry...

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry...

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry...

80
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry...

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry...

82
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry...

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry...

84
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry...

85
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry...

86
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry...

87
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry...

88
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry...

89
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry...

90
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry...

91
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry...

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sorry...

93
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry...

94
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry...

95
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry...

96
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry...

97
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry...

98
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry...

99
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry...

100
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry...

101
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry...

102
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry...

103
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry...

104
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry...

105
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry...

106
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry...

107
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry...

108
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry...

109
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry...

110
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,360
你

111
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Lord Zemme, it's time for an summary meeting between Lord K illusion.

112
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Quietly, please take his place.

113
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Eh?

114
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to go to the Webais!

115
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ento that, you can't go there.

116
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Get to the much!

117
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've known Zemia for a long time.

118
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
facetika...

119
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In the cage, there is a monkey.

120
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you going to watch?

121
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We've discussed when to eat!

122
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What!?

123
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Impossible! That's just a dream!

124
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right. Tsukimiya-san often appears in my dreams too.

125
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you're going to live with me, you're going to be a scumbag!

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're so noisy.

127
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ah! You're Hareaki!

128
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm Seimei-sama!

129
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're Hareaki!

130
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You remember me, don't you?

131
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're a rude person!

132
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Did you meet her?

133
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How come you don't remember me?

134
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's fine if you don't face me.

135
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's fine.

136
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't understand why you didn't...

137
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm serious!

138
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I fought with the demon in Yami Kaoru and was pierced through my body!

139
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then I realized I was on stage...

140
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You fought with the demon?

141
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's not even your real name, but it's impossible!

142
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I hit him with this fist!

143
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not interesting to be a joke.

144
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is it a lie or a truth?

145
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's certainly a dream.

146
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Open your heart.

147
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can't make trust with words.

148
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll show you what I'm really capable of!

149
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let me fight with Onmyoji!

150
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's the fastest way!

151
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's already been 30 minutes.

152
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What time is it?

153
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I wanted to see your power that remains in the candidate for the top five.

154
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Come on! What kind of power is that?

155
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I thought it would be interesting if what he said was true.

156
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey!

157
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What?

158
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't underestimate Onmyoji!

159
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm disappointed.

160
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's ask him to come back.

161
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Damn it! What's going on here?

162
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't understand!

163
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
By the way, this is...

164
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why isn't it working?

165
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tsukimiya and the others have forgotten about me.

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Could it be that Tsukimiya came here before he was killed?

167
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're the one who...

168
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Tsukimiya!

169
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Have you ever been on that stage before?

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's been 100 years since I've been on stage here.

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
100 years?

172
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's made to match the 100-year night.

173
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mr. Kanpak will come to see the first performance.

174
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Even though he came to see you and other great people.

175
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's it!

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When will that Kan-ta-kun come to see me?

177
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not Kan-ta-kun, it's Kanpak.

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think it's after half a month.

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
After half a month?

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I see. So that's what it is!

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you very much!

182
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Anyway, I'll definitely protect you this time!

183
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sure this is before that time.

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Tsukimiya was killed the day Kan-ta-kun came to see the stage.

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll definitely protect you this time!

186
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
For that reason, I'll become very strong!

187
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I've been waiting for you, Haryaki.

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's Takepion!

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What do you need?

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I need to see you.

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What do you need?

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Tell me...

193
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Tell me about the Onmyoujutsu!

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you know what you're saying to me?

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're interested in my power, aren't you?

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If my power and Onmyoujutsu are combined, it'll be amazing.

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't you think it's interesting?

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That power was just a mouth, after all.

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's that self-confidence you have?

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I understand.

201
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I understand.

202
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What?

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're a coward who comes back after you've done your shame.

204
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Isn't that humanity interesting?

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Instead, you'll be away for a week.

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you don't show me something amazing in the meantime,

207
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll have you confess your sins to the many spirits you've been to.

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay! I'm in!

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Onmyoujutsu is a combination of the five elements that are born from the wood, the fire, the soil, the fire, and the water.

210
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's said to convert the elements into spirits and activate them in various ways.

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The spirits are prepared for almost all humans to be born.

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
To freely use Onmyoujutsu,

213
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
it takes a long-term training of human beings with aptitude to increase their spirits.

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The greater the power of the spirits you can handle, the better the Onmyoujutsu is evaluated.

215
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I know that.

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Tell me how to use that Shikigami.

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, try this.

218
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What's this toy?

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's a training device for training. It's a Godai-kun.

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you want to control the Shikigami,

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
try injecting the spirit power and standing the Godai-kun.

222
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What do you mean by injecting the spirit power?

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Put this board on it.

224
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Like this.

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's like concentrating your spirit power and accumulating the spirit power on the board.

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay!

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then, the Godai-kun will come to call you.

228
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They're so stubborn.

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll clear this quickly.

230
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Concentrate your spirit power...

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Huh?

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Get out of here!

233
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I let you go, but you're here again.

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, it's you.

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can't believe what you're saying.

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But why are you so desperate?

237
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Whatever you say now,

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I have to get stronger for the time being.

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can't protect what I want to protect.

240
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Hey, what are you doing?

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
To control the Shikigami, the absolute amount of spirit power is lacking.

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
To measure the spirit power,

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll force you to spread the board.

244
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So I can't get stronger?

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you have the guts to endure the pain.

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Good. Do it as much as you want.

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's why I told you.

248
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm scared.

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't protect you unless you get stronger.

250
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's right.

251
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Are you also a fan of Tsukimiya-san?

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You bastard! Why are you here?

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't say anything.

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I thought I'd have you stop me.

255
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

256
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have no intention of stopping you.

257
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, really?

258
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then I only have Tsukimiya-san, my acquaintance.

259
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll have you stop me at Tsukimiya-san's house.

260
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll stop you.

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll help you.

262
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll make you a meal to thank you.

263
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Why did you call me?

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a business.

265
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Eat it while it's hot.

266
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Then...

267
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's delicious because it's made by someone like you.

268
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You...

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're so mean!

270
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're so mean!

271
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're so mean!

272
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Jifuku!

273
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh, thank goodness.

274
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Eat up.

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I didn't mean to be mean because I was good at eating.

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I didn't mean to do that.

277
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
By the way, who are you trying to protect?

278
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Tsukimiya-san.

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Time Leap?

280
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's right.

281
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Tsukimiya-san will die in half a month.

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's hard to believe.

283
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, I guess so.

284
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But I can say one thing.

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're not the one who's protecting Tsukimiya-san.

286
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's me.

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Go ahead.

288
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll show you by my actions.

289
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Migatame!

290
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is also the power of Jutsu.

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Hey, what's this?

292
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's here.

293
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's one of the five great skills of Onmyou Jutsu, the power of Riki.

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Riki?

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a Jutsu that strengthens the body.

296
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The Migatame method uses this power in both defense and attack.

297
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Then it's about time you can use Jutsu.

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Don't underestimate me.

299
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It'll take at least a year to learn it.

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
A year?

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have to do something about the day when Tsukimiya-san is caught up in the dark with Haryaki.

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
How long are you going to be with that idiot?

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Do you intend to be chosen by your parents?

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Of course.

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I may see it through Takeru.

306
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not useless.

307
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You're saying that there's something more to do than that now?

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You have something to tell me, don't you?

309
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In 60 seconds, a dark aura will be emitted.

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's estimated to be around 200mA, at the center of the Kachou-82.

311
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This time, the dark aura is 3.6 degrees.

312
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's about the same as the one before.

313
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I didn't know it was like this.

314
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
When did you...

315
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You're going to the dark aura, right?

316
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm going too.

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't be stupid!

318
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You can't enter the dark aura unless you're a Shikigami.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can enter it.

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The one who showed off his amazing power before was in the dark aura.

321
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Maybe I can do that again.

322
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No!

323
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't have time!

324
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can use Riki's power now.

325
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I won't get in your way!

326
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You don't have the ability.

327
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you can't do this, you don't have the right to fight in the dark aura.

328
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Be quiet!

329
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Damn it!

330
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm not going!

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You...

332
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What did you do?

333
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What happened to the dark aura?

334
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I and Yura made it end.

335
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why don't you let me fight too?

336
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Follow me.

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What is this place?

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This is the place where the dark aura was destroyed three years ago.

339
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Shikigami was greatly attacked by my death.

340
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I left my senior and left the war.

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
To get back that death...

342
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I won't let you do it!

343
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The senior who was left died.

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The dark aura...

345
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you lose the fight in the dark aura,

346
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
the things that were there before will disappear.

347
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Your half-hearted resolve will take everything away.

348
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It is your responsibility to eliminate the demons even if you die.

349
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You said there was something you wanted to protect.

350
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm the same.

351
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If you're going to get in my way, I won't forgive you.

352
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's been a week since we promised.

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That man has already left.

354
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He hasn't been training for a few days.

355
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's too bad.

356
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Did I misjudge him?

357
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They're coming.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In 30 seconds, the dark aura will be generated.

359
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This time, the dark aura is 5.6 degrees.

360
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a big scale.

361
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Shoot! I'll deploy it!

362
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Onmyoji, Atsunaga, Yura, Shikijin, come forward!

363
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hoganrikuzen, Shoushinjuu, get ready!

364
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hoganrikuzen, Shoushinjuu, get ready!

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Are you ready?

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, let's get started.

367
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm ready.

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Be careful.

369
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
They're coming.

370
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's the main body.

371
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He's controlling the air with a range.

372
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Reduce the distance.

373
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
In the meantime, complete the Raihou Jutsu.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll finish the main body in one blow.

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Understood.

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm impressed.

377
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
As expected of a candidate with a good taste.

378
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You can do it!

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The best of the best!

380
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Mokucho Oka Daikutsu!

381
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yura, are you okay?

382
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Atsunaga...

383
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He's still alive.

384
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
His soul power is also greatly increased by himself.

385
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Disappear!

386
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Atsunaga!

387
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Atsunaga is...

388
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He's still alive.

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
His soul power is also greatly increased by himself.

390
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Disappear!

391
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Atsunaga!

392
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
One blow of heart, one blow of soul!

393
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That guy...

394
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No way!

395
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Atsunaga, stop!

396
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I won't lose!

397
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'll protect the Eian Mirror!

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll destroy all the nine heavens!

399
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't be a fool and go for it, Atsunaga!

400
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He's melting!

401
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He's inside the闇凰竜!

402
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That guy really...

403
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He was just trying to make a body...

404
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That power...

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But before I knew it...

406
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You have to be able to do this much.

407
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Well, that was the first success.

408
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What?

409
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're very determined.

410
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The Onmyo Jutsu isn't that easy.

411
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But there's something I can't give up.

412
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Open up, Kakun!

413
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You can't build trust with words!

414
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You have to show it with your true actions!

415
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Come in, Kakun.

416
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The Shikigami usually exerts power by controlling them together.

417
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Even if you're immature, it's better than not being there.

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Interesting.

419
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll do it!

420
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That Shikigami is...

421
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Takeru?

422
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You were surprised.

423
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll do the Takepyo!

424
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let me do it too!

425
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Takeyoshi

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Did you see that, Haryaki?

427
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yura!

428
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Are you okay?

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Did you see that, Yura?

430
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll take your life instead of yours!

431
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What?

432
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The Shikigami of the Onmyo Jutsu is a Gohat.

433
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is the Onmyo Jutsu.

434
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Your power and the Onmyo Jutsu's combination was interesting.

435
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Would you like to officially become the Onmyo Jutsu, Takeru Narihira?

436
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm sorry.

461
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000

489
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000

490
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000

I'm sorry.

498
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
