00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Chapter 3

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The 12 angels of the life...

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I've never seen them before.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What's going on?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're in pain.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Does that mean you're against your will?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The weight of this blow is way different from the Shikigami.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't want to cause any more damage to the city.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's it.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
45th King, Shou!

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
As I thought, the world's best.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll end this with this.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's not a secret technique.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is your power.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll show you what I'm made of!

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want to see the world,

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm drowning in loneliness, cry out!

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No matter what kind of kiss I give you,

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to protect you, so I grab your hand.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No matter how many times I walk,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I leave behind my hesitation.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm a sensitive lady,

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I cry out for the despair

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that I won't ever erase.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Where am I?

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Where's Tsukimiya?

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You've come to your senses.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey, where's Tsukimiya?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's going on?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You seem to be in a good mood.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Come on, come with me.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Tsukimiya!

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're safe!

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I heard everything.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You went back in time and protected me.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I promised to protect you.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No problem.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You know,

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it's not a good situation to be happy.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Did I do it?

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you don't stop it,

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the damage isn't this bad.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Your power

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
isn't something you could use from the beginning.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The fact that you came to this world

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and the time leap,

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
that power suddenly became useful.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I want to use your power

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
to use it in the next Hundred Years Night.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What?

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's a dangerous power!

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Even if it's a dangerous power,

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
it will always win.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Wait!

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What is the Hundred Years Night?

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's the time when the boundary

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
between the world of demons

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and the Hundred Years Night is easy to mix.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I heard that.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The Hundred Years Night

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
is the ritual to attack the world of demons

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and destroy the demons.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're going to attack me?

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The two chosen five-star?s

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
are the strongest of the four gods.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They will bring great gods and fight seven times.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
By continuing to win this ritual,

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the safety of the Denji Heian Temple has been maintained for a thousand years.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A thousand years...

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So,

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you're going to be one of the five-star?s?

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This ritual needs to connect the world with the demons.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's my job.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's why you chose someone who can fight instead.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The power of demons is one step further in this Hundred Years Night.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's why I think that the next Hundred Years Night

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
needs explosive power.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Takeru.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Will you be the five-star?

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're the five-star?

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Shut up.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No way.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I told you to let me think.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I probably won't.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's disgusting!

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're stupid!

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The five-star is the best!

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's why.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The one who learned the secret magic shouldn't do it.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What if you can't control your power again?

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I see.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So, what are you going to do now?

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I was able to protect Tsukimiya.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Are you going back to the original world?

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't know how to go back.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Either way,

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
there are things I have to do.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Fortunately, I didn't die.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That Shikigami is you.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thanks to you, I'm in this state.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm ashamed to have a guy like you.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not my fault.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Seimei!

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm the one who appointed him as Onmyoji.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm really sorry.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, no. Stop it.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Please let me help you.

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If you use the magic, you can fix it right away.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm tired from yesterday's fight.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I feel like I'm changing my mind when I meet the people in the city.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've seen you live in a state of sluggishness to spend better days.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I've been encouraged many times over a thousand years.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A thousand years?

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes. I've lived for more than a thousand years.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What? Is it such a long time?

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, I'm a special being.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's why I'm more impressed just by doing this.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Here, the repair is complete.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Thank you.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's what it is.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I have an idea about the control of your power.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I found it.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Takell!

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Shikimiya!

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What's wrong?

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, do you have time tomorrow night?

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm done with this help at night.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm fine.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yay!

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm 100 years old and I have a lot of stores.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So let's go together.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Together?

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes. I want to thank you for saving me.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's a date, isn't it?

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll go! I'll definitely go!

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're kidding.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yukata!

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:21,860
She's so cute with her

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay!

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why are you here?

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I have a lot of lovers.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If I'm alone, I'll stand out.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,660
I won't forgive Tsukimiya and Takell's

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not happy.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Matsunaga-kun!

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're a good looking guy.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm done.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There's one in this world, too.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll make you my face.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You should have called me sooner.

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I thought you were in the way.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Not at all.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In the way, in the way.

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Didn't we get in the way?

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You two are lovers.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, you.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You seem to be having a lot of fun.

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry again.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Eat the dango.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sure you've helped me a lot.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry about yesterday.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You saved me from the makeup.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I heard it from my sister.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You have a lively hairstyle.

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, it's cool.

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Really?

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Really? Are you going?

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Takell-kun.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You must have a lot of friends in the world you used to live in.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, I don't know.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But the 100-year night festival is a great ceremony.

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Is it okay to have a festival?

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I think it's a life-saving event for all of you.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But you've never lost a 100-year night festival in a thousand years.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's more like a cake-sitting event.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Tsukimiya-san.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've been looking for you.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What's wrong, Miyoshi-chan?

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Ichiza was chosen as the head of the department of the 100-year night festival.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Really?

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A festival?

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For us who will be participating in the 100-year night festival,

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the people of the town will be excited.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll go and dance to the cake-sitting.

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The 100-year night festival is a festival that is held in the town of Ichiza.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The people of the town will be excited.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The people of Ichiza will be excited.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The people of Ichiza will be excited.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The people of Ichiza will be excited.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Takell-kun?

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What?

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What's wrong?

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Wasn't it fun?

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No, it's the opposite.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I was wondering if it was okay to have so much fun.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What do you want to do, Takell-kun?

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What?

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What do I want to do?

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's a kiss or something like that.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I was wondering what you wanted to do from now on.

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, that's it.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Do you want to go back to the world you were?

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No one's waiting for me to go back there.

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
My father and mother have died a long time ago.

230
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was really floating because I was so excited.

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But I didn't want to quit because I was longing for my father and mother.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I felt like my father and mother were watching me when I was protecting my family who had been beaten up since I was little.

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I thought I wasn't alone.

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But when I came here, I was able to fight together and get a real title.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I met someone who needed me.

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I met someone I liked.

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I finally understood the meaning of the phrase,

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Don't be alone, Ka-kun.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So I thought I could stay here a little longer.

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm glad you need me.

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm doing my best because there are people who are happy to dance every night.

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Takell also came here to protect me because he promised to protect me.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes.

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know what kind of power is working.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sure you still need me to be here after protecting me.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Me?

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm glad Takell is in Denji Heian.

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm glad.

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I didn't go to bother you.

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll watch you a lot tonight.

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The ceremony of appointment of the five-person family begins.

253
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The two chosen five-person families, forward.

254
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes.

255
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes.

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hey, Takell.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Do your best, Takell.

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't know what power it is.

259
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But it's okay.

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The five-person family is not one, but two.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Atsuna can use his control technology to use your explosive power.

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And you guys have already experienced it.

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's give a round of applause to the two brave five-person families.

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Unfortunately, I wanted to go to the Hundred Years Night School with you, who have been fighting together for many years.

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Shut up!

266
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The Hundred Years Night School is still going on.

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If you guys fight without any problems, it will change immediately.

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Do you understand?

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't die!

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Of course.

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:48,700
Takell, as you know, the Shikigami will take the soul of the Jutsu and bring the Shikijin to the

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes.

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes.

275
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

276
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes.

279
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes.

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes.

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

282
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes.

283
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes.

284
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes.

285
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes.

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes.

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes.

290
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes.

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

292
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes.

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yes.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes.

295
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes.

296
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes.

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes.

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes.

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes.

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes.

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yes.

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes.

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes.

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes.

308
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes.

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes.

310
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes.

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes.

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes.

315
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yes.

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes.

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You two, please take care of the rest.

318
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That guy is huge!

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm not going to lose!

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Here it comes!

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Episode 2

322
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't let the Daishikijin's power run out!

323
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's get it!

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Roger!

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
As planned, the first control is yours.

326
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
While you're used to the Daishikijin's movements, narrow the distance.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay!

328
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Daishikijin's power is overflowing!

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's a great response!

330
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't go in the dark clouds.

331
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Control your movements first.

332
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Turn around!

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What is that?

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't get too close.

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll cut you off in the distance.

336
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Raihou!

337
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He's coming this way!

338
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I won't let you!

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's an demon!

340
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're in the way!

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Damn it!

342
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Wait!

343
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The demon god is...

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The seventh...

345
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It can't be! It's a seven-legged tiger!

346
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a seven-legged tiger.

347
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
As you progress, your body is strengthened by the number of times you die.

348
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The seventh will complete you.

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The secret technique of the breath!

350
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
A demon god?

351
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Get away!

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll block it!

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Leave it to me!

354
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll do this!

355
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's badly damaged!

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It'll collapse if we don't do anything!

357
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll do it!

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Takelu, leave everything to me.

359
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I was born in this town.

360
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I was born in this town.

361
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
If you want to live, you can do it alone!

362
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What are you doing?

363
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
One body, one body...

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There's no life!

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll end this world!

366
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll end this world!

367
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The Great Shikijin has appeared!

368
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's over there.

369
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Stop! Stop it!

370
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Haleage!

371
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What are you doing?

372

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This peace is over.

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's a pity.

379
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000

380
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000

386
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
One more time...

387
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll do it again.

389
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

390
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I don't remember.

392
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't wanna lose to myself.

393
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know if I'm going to die.

394
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't know if I'm going to die.

395
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If it's not over, I want to look up to the moon in the sky.

396
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm still, still turning around.

397
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:54,000
No matter what kind of world comes, I'll stand on your mark.

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm still, still turning around.

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No matter what kind of world comes, I'll stand on your mark.

400
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm still, still turning around.

401
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
No matter what kind of world comes, I'll stand on your mark.
