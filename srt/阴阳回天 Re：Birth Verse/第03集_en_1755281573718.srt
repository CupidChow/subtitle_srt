Chapter 3 The Newcomer

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're the one? The newcomer who's so full of life.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Is there anyone? That guy, Godai-kun, won't let us move easily. He's not our enemy.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Kajiki, you can't say that. As a senior, I have to be kind to the weak.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're so weak. Are you in a hurry to be the newcomer?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Don't get so excited. It's just a match.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Whether it's a match or not, I'm going to put my life on the line.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A match?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a one-on-one fight.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey, is this a two-on-two?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Kazura, what about the sword you asked for?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, I used all my hands to investigate.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What is the one thing that connects you to Takeru Narihira?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Then, it might be true that you came from a different world.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But I have a secret weapon.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Only the people of the Denji Heian Sect have that.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The mystery only deepens.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Calling from the depths of the snow, calling just to get to it

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The night is still far from over. The light of the infinite moon has fallen.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I decided my heart while shouting out the shadow.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The ideal that I hit and ran. The hope that was thrown away.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I will never give up. I've been convinced.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The light of the infinite moon has fallen. The pain of the night is yesterday.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The carryback is the day after yesterday. The other side is tomorrow.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Damn it!

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Keep going!

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Move!

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Alright! I won!

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is he here? Is he alright?

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Kajiki, I and Shikijin are here.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yura changed her partner?

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a battle between the two candidates.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Finish!

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hatsuna is...

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The control has changed!

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Five to one!

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The first place in the Imperial Examination!

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Doraihou!

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Damn it!

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Amazing!

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is that me?

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is a battle between Iruka and Kajiki.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't see the change of power from that time.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't think I won.

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why can't I get that black punch from that time?

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yura!

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, it seems that you don't have a bad relationship with Kajiki.

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What?

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What?

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You want to fight with him, don't you?

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't mind.

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Did you like him that much?

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No!

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can fight with Kajiki who has endurance.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't mess with me!

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then finish him off!

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Idiot!

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you for everything, Takeru.

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No, it's my food.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was surprised when Atsunaga-sama brought you here.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But you're good at unexpected things.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What about Atsunaga-sama today?

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I heard that he's training because he's close to the selection of a Goryosei.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That kind of time?

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you okay with that?

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Goryosei is the best way to get to Onmyoji, right?

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I became Onmyoji to protect Tsukimiya-san.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Your motivation is so strong.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But I'm glad that you can say it clearly.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Excuse me!

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Can you listen to my request?

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Tomorrow is the day Kanta-kun comes to see the stage, right?

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I want you to go out with me the next day.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I guess it's a little impossible.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The stage will continue.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Please do something about that!

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're a scary demon, aren't you?

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think everyone is worried about you coming here and messing up the city.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't want to lose to demons.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I want to cheer up the people of Denji Heian in front of me.

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's the meaning of living here.

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will never make a hole in the stage.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I understand.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Even if you can't be with me, I'll protect you.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's the experiment?

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Now Atsunaga will give you a serious punishment.

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What do you mean by serious?

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll kill him.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Takell, you should resist and show your power at that time.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's okay.

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
When you're about to die, Shino will help you.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In other words, what Takell needs to do is a life-threatening danger?

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Takell, it's good.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll do it.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's okay.

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The first of the five business.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Wooden fire base.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Come on!

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Lord Seimei.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Shino.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The first of the five business.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come on!

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can do it again.

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't get in my way.

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I see.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I see.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm fine.

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He has eliminated the thunder.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I was finally able to resist.

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Did you understand Takell's power?

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm not sure yet.

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But I started to think that it might be good for him.

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What?

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You're asking Takell to be your son-in-law?

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's not the right time yet.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He asked me.

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Today is the first day.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The shining of the mochi moon that is close to the demon.

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's see the light.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I finally came.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The day I came to this world.

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hey, Atsunaga.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes?

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What is a demon?

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What?

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I wonder what they're doing.

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The demon has brought people and things back to their world through Yamikauro.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And they're making it their food.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Food?

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
They're eating.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's what it means.

135
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They're chosen by their partners and their partners.

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They protect the Denji Heian Temple.

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's the dream of Yura and me.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's starting.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What a great sight!

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I fell down on stage in the middle of the show.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's why Tsukimiya-san was called by Kanta-kun.

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And he was dragged into Yamikauro in the middle.

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And...

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't need a cushion!

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What are you doing?

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Everyone, get away from here!

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yamikauro is coming soon!

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hey, are you listening?

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Go somewhere!

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What are you doing?

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're so mean, Miko Toro.

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What is he doing?

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
60 meters.

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
60 meters?

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm not sure.

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm not sure.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm not sure.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm not sure.

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not sure.

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's going on?

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In 60 seconds, Yamikauro will be generated.

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yamikauro will be generated in the middle of the show?

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Damn it!

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hurry! Hurry!

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What's this?

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm not letting you do the same as before!

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He was generated by Yamikauro?

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Takeru said that time has come.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Tsukimiya-san saw him die in front of him.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And the moment he died, time came back.

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And today is the day.

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Until now, it was half-heartedly.

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But I believe in it.

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No matter who Takeru Narihira is.

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yesterday's Yamikauro.

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That girl was safe.

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That means...

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Tsukimiya-san will definitely be saved.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And when I wasn't on stage,

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Tsukimiya-san wasn't called out by Kanta-kun.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He's already saved.

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You?

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Hey, let me see your face.

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What?

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm busy today.

187
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Enough!

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What?

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
No more secret spells.

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Only the physical spells are used.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What?

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's decide which one of us is stronger.

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Look, Taiman.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then I can't not accept it.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is this place okay?

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's too late for Yamikauro, who was involved in Tsukimiya-san's death.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But why did you suddenly turn down Taiman?

199
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Is it because Atsunaga and I are a team?

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I just want to make it clear which one is stronger.

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I see.

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's really okay without the secret spell.

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Of course.

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If you get on your knees or something, you lose.

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I agree.

206
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then...

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Let's go!

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, that's good.

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's beautiful!

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No, not today.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What's today?

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's the day when Takeru-kun is important.

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I can't say that.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hey, the official is here.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Tsukimiya's performance yesterday was wonderful, so I'll give you a reward.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You can go now.

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're strong even without the secret spell.

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You're the best at kicking.

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
My fist is hard.

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't make fun of me!

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I didn't do it.

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What does a fist like you know?

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You say the best and the most annoying things, but you don't know it well.

224
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Shut up, amateur!

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have to be the best at everything.

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I can't go!

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have to fight Atsunaga!

228
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But what is Atsunaga?

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Kajiki is your partner, so it's a fight like you.

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If you have something to say, say it clearly!

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I know.

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The fact that I'm pulling his leg...

233
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm done.

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm done.

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm done.

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I won.

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Aim for that moment?

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Open your eyes, Kajiki.

239
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Everything you see in front of you is everything.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's natural to attack someone you've seen before.

241
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's right.

242
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's why Atsunaga is so affectionate.

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Open your eyes, Kajiki.

244
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Don't look at everything you see.

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No matter how you look at it, you won't understand its true feelings.

246
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
If you want to know, ask me.

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Isn't your Kajiki innocent?

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What? I'm not innocent.

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I see.

250
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
20 seconds later, Yami Kaoru is here.

251
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
20 seconds?

252
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's still before noon, and it's too early!

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Takei!

254
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Takei!

255
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Tsukiyo!

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What?

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He went on stage!

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Takei!

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Help me!

260
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What the hell?

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Takei!

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
A real car?

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
A real car.

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't know, Atsunaga?

265
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yami Kaoru got you.

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If you're waiting for someone else,

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you and I have no choice but to bring the commander here.

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let me control it.

269
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I have to protect Tsukimiya.

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll take care of that demon.

271
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What are you saying?

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're not...

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's okay. If it's you...

274
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Stop!

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll finish him off!

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
A basic attack?

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's right. That's what I was talking about.

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He's getting more powerful!

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You're not going to eat me like that?

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Tsukimiya!

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Thank goodness. I'm safe.

282
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This guy... Tsukimiya...

283
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Damn it! He's dirty!

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He's not moving!

285
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh no!

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The low-speed road is too slow!

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He's not moving!

288
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
This is the worst outcome!

289
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We have to keep our distance, Takei!

290
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Takei!

291
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll make you do it.

292
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This time, I'll definitely...

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Protect you!

294
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So this is your power?

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're here.

296
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're not going to get away!

297
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I know your pattern!

298
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't lose!

299
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Tsukimiya...

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He's alive!

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He's alive!

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
All right!

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Tsukimiya is alive!

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He's alive!

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We've protected Tsukimiya!

306
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Tsukimiya!

307
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Tsukimiya!

308
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Zacker?!

309
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What's this?!

310
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Hey, Zacker!

311
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ouch!

312
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Kira!

313
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What's going on?!

314
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What's going on?!

315
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,320
Kira,

316
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,000
come back to me!

317
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What's happening to you?!

318
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,100
Sn Storm Cannot Bereaked

319
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,360
Swordsmen of Southernsy fried

320
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,800
be like the iron

321
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,760
inro80

322
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Take this!

323
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Take this, Takeru.
