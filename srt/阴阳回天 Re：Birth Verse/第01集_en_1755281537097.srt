00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 3

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's over there!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Over here!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What the hell?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This monster!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Over here!

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's hitting me! It's hitting me!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Be quiet.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It seems like it went away.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Ah, thank you.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh!

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What the hell?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You scared me.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I wasn't scared!

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The monster before me was flying away if I wasn't injured.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I see.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're really strong.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not going to lose.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then it's your turn.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When I'm in danger, will you help me?

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I won't lose to you.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's thin.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a promise.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a trap.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wait!

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I...

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to...

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
T-t-trap...

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to trap you!

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You were sleeping with a sleepy face.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You were sleeping with a sleepy face.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're done for today.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Zokkon!

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Mr. Zokkon!

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I thought we'd meet again.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's the 1999th episode.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's back.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The first love is the girl in the dream.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What's that?

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Most Melhain's...

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not a dream.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you okay?

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mr. Zokkon is real.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You think you can win?

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Admit defeat and apologize!

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Ouch!

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Listen carefully, Kakun of the Narihira family.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't admit defeat until you die.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't admit defeat even if you die.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In other words, I, Takeru Narihira, will not lose.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Again?

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I hate you for that.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Come on, you coward.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then die.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry!

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't lose to that Zokkon.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll keep my promise.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's not a dream.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll meet you again.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wait a minute!

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You won?

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're a coward!

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't let him get away!

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Pak, watch out!

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, no. I can't keep my promise.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, no!

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's going on?

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The second round!

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The third round!

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The fourth round!

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The second round!

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The second round!

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's been a while!

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's me!

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was saved at that time!

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well...

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What?

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What are you doing?

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Come back soon!

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a local guy!

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think he fell.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wait a minute!

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's me!

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll make a promise with Takebayashi!

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a new play!

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a lack of everything.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's 100 times more interesting than the last time!

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right, Seiji?

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well...

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't hate Shinji, but...

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Today is a special day.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What?

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was really interesting.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I'll leave the rest to you.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You can leave the rest to me.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who's stupid?

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Enough!

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go!

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I hate him.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What should I do?

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey, where do you sell it?

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
At the convenience store?

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Convenience store?

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why don't you buy it?

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You don't respond to my request.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So give me 1000 yen.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
1000 yen?

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, it's a battery money.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, the battery...

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You should treat the customer more seriously!

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hey, where are we?

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's the 7th floor of the building.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's Tokyo.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Tokyo?

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is the Denji Heian-kyo.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What?

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Denji Heian-kyo?

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's right.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I was here when I first met Mr. Zokkon.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Where did Reiwa go?

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
By the way, Heian-kyo means...

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Time Leap?

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I have no choice but to see it.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's going on?

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
60 seconds later, a dark cloud appears.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The area around the area is 200 meters.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you're in the area, please move the evacuation site nearby.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Are you serious?

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Hey, get out of the way!

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What's going on?

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, are you okay?

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What's going on?

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Is he alive?

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey, what are you doing?

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Stop it!

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I can't run away!

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Is it real?

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm not dead anymore?

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Bastard!

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There's another one.

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is it a normal person?

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why isn't it de-spawned?

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's in the dark cloud.

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What's wrong with him?

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't move.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We'll attract the demon.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Can you talk?

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He's talking too fast.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll beat him up.

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What?

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If you let him go, you'll get a bad fever.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Bastard!

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Get back!

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's go, Atsunaga!

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yura, I'll stop you with one blow.

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
One in five seconds!

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Wooden Fire Daikichi!

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Go-Rai-Four!

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
This is Kazura.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We've confirmed the recovery.

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Good job, Atsunaga, Yura.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I saw him on stage.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There's another one over there!

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Are you okay?

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That voice...

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You guys were controlling that weirdo?

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What?

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Are you messing with our commander?

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I wanted to beat that monster up.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't get in my way!

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Are you stupid?

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You think you can win with your bare hands?

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah!

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm not going to lose!

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What's going on?

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, well, well.

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're amazing at moving in the dark cloud.

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But it's impossible for you to beat the demon.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's not a curse.

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's a curse?

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Atsunaga, please come with me.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm fine.

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't feel any pain.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Good.

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But let's just check it out just in case.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay.

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't understand.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No good.

197
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's negative.

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Open up, Kakun!

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We'll think about it after we eat!

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Huh?

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You were just...

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You had a hard time after that.

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You came to see the great man like Lord Kanpak.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know what's going on.

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't you remember me?

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Huh?

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're injured.

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's so sticky!

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I heard about you.

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You came from another world, didn't you?

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think so.

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I've never heard of anyone who can move in the dark cloud.

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And Tokyo?

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There's no such city.

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I see.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So he's a demon?

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's possible.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Wait a minute!

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm a human!

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What the hell is a demon?

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And the one who's called the Dark Cloud...

224
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
A demon.

225
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A human enemy from another world.

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And the Dark Kaoru.

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The demon world is attacking this world.

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Isn't this a crazy world?

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You want to go back to your own world, don't you?

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, but...

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I finally met you.

232
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can ask Lord Onmyoji for advice.

233
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's a good idea.

234
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Lord Onmyoji?

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That great guy?

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He's a great guy.

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
This Denji Heian Temple is built by Lord Onmyoji.

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He's controlling the Shikigami and protecting them.

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So, you're going to follow Lord Onmyoji?

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm going to do it.

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Abeno Seimei.

242
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The Demon World

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Wow!

244
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Um, Kirisu!

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Have we really met before?

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, a while ago.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What did you talk about?

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I promised to become stronger and protect you.

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I see.

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you. I won't forget it.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes!

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
By the way, what's your name?

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm Takeru Narihira.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm Tsukimiya.

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I was welcomed yesterday with Lord Kanpak.

256
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you.

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What's he doing?

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He's Lord Kanpak's servant.

259
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He came here yesterday.

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You showed me something ridiculous.

261
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's all because of the intruder.

262
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Lord Kanpak is angry that you're not worthy of the 100-year-old emperor's throne.

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
As an apology, I'll punish you.

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Where do you want to go?

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm the one who destroyed the stage yesterday.

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What's wrong with you?

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
If you're angry about Lord Kanpak, I'll apologize.

268
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Come on, Tsukimiya.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I told you.

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Tsukimiya has nothing to do with it.

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What?

272
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You again?

273
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You're a drunkard.

274
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You read it like that.

275
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll punish you.

276
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What's wrong with you?

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Anyway, Lord Kanpak is waiting for you.

278
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Let's go.

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I won't do anything wrong.

280
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll do it right now.

281
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes.

282
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Damn it!

283
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He was a weird guy.

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But he's not motivated, is he?

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's right.

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What a great man!

287
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Here they come.

288
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
20 seconds later, a dark cloud appears.

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The time is too short.

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's the 100-year-old emperor's throne.

291
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We have no choice but to escape.

292
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Senji!

293
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Tsukino's cart!

294
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is it Tsukimiya's cart?

295
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Where are you going?

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's Tsukimiya's cart.

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I promised you.

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll save you.

299
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll finish you with this.

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes, leave it to me.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's that weird guy again.

302
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Anyway, it's Tsukimiya.

303
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Over there!

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll eat you!

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll eat you!

306
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He's surrounded!

307
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He's coming for us!

308
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
A gate?

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
A gate?

310
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He's coming for us!

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Damn it!

312
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm going to get caught!

313
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Something's coming!

314
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm going to keep a distance!

315
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Wait!

316
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Everyone in town is...

317
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Tsukimiya!

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Wait!

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The efficiency of the race track is decreasing!

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Kazera.

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What's the situation?

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Tsukimiya!

323
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Tsukimiya!

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll protect you!

325
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He's inside the dark cauldron again!

326
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can't see anything!

327
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I can do it!

328
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He's strong...

329
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Damn it...

330
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Not yet...

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Another strong one is coming!

332
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Seiji!

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It seems he hasn't given up yet.

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Narihira Kekka-kun!

335
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't admit defeat until you die!

336
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Don't admit defeat even if you die!

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Narihira Takeru will never lose even if he dies!

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
One shot...

339
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
One shot...

340
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll shoot!

341
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He transformed...

342
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It doesn't matter anymore.

343
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I came to this world for this moment!

344
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'll protect Tsukimiya!

345
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
One shot!

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's interesting.

347
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He's...

348
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Tsukimiya...

349
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Thank goodness.

350
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He's not broken.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's a shell!

352
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The shell isn't broken yet!

353
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
No way...

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Tsukimiya...

355
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I won't accept this ending...

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Damn it...

357
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I won't accept this ending...

358
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I won't accept this ending...

359
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I won't accept this ending...

360
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I won't accept this ending...

361
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I won't accept this ending...

362
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I won't accept this ending...

363
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I want to look up at the moon in the sky forever.

364
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm still...

365
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm still...

366
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm still...

367
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm still turning around.

368
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
No matter what world comes,

369
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll be there in 3 seconds.
