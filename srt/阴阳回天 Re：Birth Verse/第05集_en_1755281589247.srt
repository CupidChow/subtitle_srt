00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Chapter 3

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hey, are you okay?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I couldn't protect you anymore.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I was weak, but...

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This peace-keeping is over.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Unfortunately.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That bastard!

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Be quiet, you traitor!

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
T-Tanaka?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Leave this to me!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Bring Haneaki here!

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm tired of saying that you're a human!

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No matter what kind of kiss I give you,

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want to protect you, so I grab your hand.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No matter how many times I try,

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I leave behind the future I've been able to achieve.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm a rigid, sensitive lady.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I cry out for despair that I'll never erase.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The End

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So? Did you bring Parker here, to be honest?

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I was wondering what to do, since I was working on the board.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Who the hell are you?

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This peace-making mirror is over.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What?

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You said that back then.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What do you mean?

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're a ghost!

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've never said anything like that.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's why I'm going to say it now!

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You said that, and Atsunaga, Yura, and the other mysterious places,

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and the people of the peace-making mirror abandoned you!

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What's with him?

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I said I wanted to protect the peace-making mirror!

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you doing here?

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
My wish is that the peace-making mirror

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
will reflect the future forever.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's all I want.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're so damn annoying!

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What are you doing to Seijama?

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Did you kill him?

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's playing tricks on you.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh no.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Huh? Where did he go?

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's find him!

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, let's find him!

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's going after Seimei!

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We found him a moment ago, so we need to capture him!

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That damn Haruhaki.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Damn it.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No one's listening to me.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, and when is it?

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Kanta hasn't come to see Tsukimiya yet, has he?

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yamikawa!

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm going to protect everyone!

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Seimei...

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's this?

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh no!

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's the guy from before.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A dolphin?

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That was close.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was expecting that.

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're a dolphin.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you say that, you'll get in trouble again.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't worry about him.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We'll just have to capture Yamikawa.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go!

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah!

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's going on?

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why was he shaking?

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is this a sudden...

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's going on?

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It hurts!

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't fight anymore!

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What are you saying?

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm hungry.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's going on?

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey, get out of the way!

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Get out of the way!

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, the fever's gone down.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Tsukimiya!

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You look good even if you've been sleeping for three days.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Should I bring you some food?

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Please.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Three days?

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why am I here?

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You found the one that was lying down.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can't leave it.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But the one who was taking care of me was Miyoshi.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I had a stage.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
When did you come to see Tsukimiya?

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
About Kanpaku?

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It was a while ago.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What do you mean?

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So you were called out by Kanpaku yesterday?

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, the servant came.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But Ichiza said that a sick person had come, so he postponed it.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What?

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's about you.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have to take care of you, too.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But why did you know that Kanpaku called you?

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No, it's just a dream.

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Really?

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What a weird dream.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You couldn't get involved in the dark because you were taking care of me?

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The future has changed because I did something different.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm so embarrassed that I'm here because of that.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's gone. Are you okay?

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why are you doing this?

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You don't know me, do you?

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah, why?

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You were crying when you suddenly appeared on stage.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You were crying because of me, weren't you?

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You couldn't protect me again.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm curious.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What does that mean?

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll tell Tsukimiya.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I saw the peace bridge collapse.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A dream?

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's not a dream.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Actually, I was repeating the same time.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's called a time leap.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What?

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's why the peace bridge collapsed.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I'm back in the past.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I see.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I can't believe it all of a sudden.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a story like this.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, but you can believe it.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What?

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I think the tears of that time were real.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll do a practice.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's a ghost stone, but it seems to have regained consciousness.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is that so?

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why is Tsukimiya hiding?

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You don't have to catch me.

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You just tried to hit me.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But I'm curious about your purpose.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's swim for a while.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Seijama, I'm here.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The Tsurubushi Kaisen group is approaching.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We'll head there.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's dark.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Again.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Am I scared?

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
No way.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We lost to the demon again?

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This time, the damage was also done.

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The people of Onmyoji who fought...

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It can't be!

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's Atsunaga and Yura!

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's okay.

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Atsunaga-kun taught me.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is that so?

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But the situation has gotten worse.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The demon's power has increased by one step in the last 100 years.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can't win the 100-year night king like this.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Damn it!

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's the same demon as before.

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The people who were defeated are candidates for the top.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I couldn't enter the闇カオル.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What?

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm afraid of demons now.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I couldn't fight with my power.

198
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So I have to get stronger quickly.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If not...

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I can't do anything.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I can't do anything.

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know if I can help you.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Look at me.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
As your opponent, you're said to be a genius of 1000 years.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But what do you think of me now?

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're the town girl over there, right?

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No, you're very beautiful.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm not talking about that right now.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm scared every time before the show.

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But I'm the town girl who's scared.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is useful at such a time.

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're a man?

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm a man.

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A man has a lot of power.

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
When you put on your clothes and sharpen your nerves,

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
you become someone who is not me.

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You can become a man of 1000 years.

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Something in you awakens.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The possibilities open up.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
While being aware of the area below the belly button,

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
you can breathe.

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How was it?

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It really did change my mood.

240
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I've been using this since I was a kid.

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll give it to you if you want.

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Can I?

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You should try it too.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How is it?

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I can smell the fire.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, it's not done at all.

249
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This demon is a ice-blading user.

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If it's a simple ice-blading,

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
the slingshots should have been able to handle it.

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why did they lose so easily?

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The slingshot's voice was the one that was mischievous.

254
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't make me!

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's so cute!

256
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm going to die!

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Zelpon was a strong kid,

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
but he wasn't good at bugs.

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
When I was a kid,

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was bitten by a bug and it was really swollen.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I was scared that it would keep getting on my face.

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
On the other hand, Kaizen was not good at sharp things.

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't give me that love!

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This is the will of a mental attack.

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This demon reproduces the fear of the other person's mind.

266
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It connects the power of its fear to the ice-blading.

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There is a high chance that the same demon will appear in the next Yami Kaoru.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I can't use my power now,

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
after a hundred years of being a demon.

270
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So I have no choice but to entrust it to you.

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Please.

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Please win.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes!

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Stop!

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Can't you grab it yet?

276
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't know.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't know if I can move properly when I'm a demon.

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're thinking too much.

279
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Focus on taking one step forward.

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's just one step, but the best one.

281
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If you stack them up,

282
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
one Narihira Takeru will come down in a thousand years.

283
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Maybe.

284
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I see.

285
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
First, the best step.

286
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes.

287
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's a smiling sight.

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But what are you?

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's die.

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes.

291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In 120 seconds, the Yami Kaoru will be activated.

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The center of the Sakyo Shijo Shibo.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Shijo Shibo?

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Here?

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Tsukimiya-san!

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please evacuate quickly!

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes!

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You are?

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
When I was worried that I couldn't enter the Yami Kaoru,

300
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
they came to me.

301
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's like a fight.

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You bastard!

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Takeru-kun.

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You bastard.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's you!

306
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Where are you?

307
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm here.

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's you!

309
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You did the Iruka and the Kajiki!

310
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't be scared.

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll do it.

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Come on!

313
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Come on!

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Come on!

315
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The power of that time!

316
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I knew it!

317
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're saying it's no good again?

318
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You bastard.

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Enpou!

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Damn it!

321
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Take this!

322
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Azuna!

323
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yura!

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That head...

325
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's him!

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But why is he moving?

327
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't be so careless, Azuna!

328
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You're going to die before the spiritual attack!

329
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I know!

330
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The best of the five.

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Wooden or stone,

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Thunder Cannon!

333
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The spiritual attack...

334
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Did I say that?

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That means...

336
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This ice is my fear.

337
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
My emotions have become a form.

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Damn it!

339
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
After all, it's a trap.

340
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Takeru-kun!

341
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Continue the attack, Azuna!

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What?

343
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm not going to let you get away!

344
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Continue, Azuna!

345
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The best of the five!

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Damn it!

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Please, Azuna!

348
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Not again!

349
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Damn it!

350
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Enpou!

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Show me what you've got!

352
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What do we do?

353
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What do we do?

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The two of us are done for.

355
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The two of us are done for.

356
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What do we do?

357
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What do we do?

358
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What do we do?

359
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What do we do?

360
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What do we do?

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What do we do?

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What do we do?

363
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We can't do anything.

364
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Is it the same as it was back then?

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What do we do?

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Aren't you thinking too much?

367
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Focus on taking one step forward.

368
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's just one step, but it's the best one.

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Just one step...

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
No, just one shot.

371
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The best shot...

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's all I need.

373
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
One of the thousand-year-old, Narihira Takeru has fallen.

374
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Damn it!

375
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Stop!

376
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Stop!

377
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The End

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The End

379
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The End

380
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The End
