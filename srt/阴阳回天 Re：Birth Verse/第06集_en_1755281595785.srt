00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He's transforming!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's cool!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, I'm getting the power!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is my best move!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Alright!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Tension爆上!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah!

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This peace-keeping is over.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Too bad.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Kareaki...

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The next ice is your death!

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Bastard!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're not going to listen to me now!

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you're going to do that, come at me!

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You can't move like this!

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll finish you with this!

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The sword is gone!

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's amazing, Seijama!

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Who are you?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What's with that power?

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, it's my best move.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I might not have to kill you with this.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That sword is in this field!

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's a great weapon!

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It might be a sword.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That scoundrel should be here!

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He was in the dark hall.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Be careful!

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
See you!

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hey! What do you mean by that?

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Tsukimiya-san, I did it!

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Good evening.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Seimei-sama!

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why are you here?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
By the way...

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have something to tell you.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
To me?

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The night is still far away.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The light of the moon has fallen.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My heart is screaming,

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
shining in the shadows.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The ideals that I've been fighting for,

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the hope that I've been avoiding,

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will never give up.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sure of it.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to show you my true self.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No way, I'm going to show you my pain.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going to turn you back into a black person.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The End

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, what are you talking about?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I want to ask Ichiza, the next 100-year-old student,

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to be the dance teacher for the graduation ceremony.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, really?

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's amazing!

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have to let everyone know.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm talking about Takeru Narihira.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Takeru?

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How much do you know about his abilities?

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How much do you know about his abilities?

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What do you mean?

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The power that transcends time,

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and the power that I showed you with the Dark Kaoru.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How did you get that power?

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Wait a minute.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Takeru, you're safe, right?

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Wow! I really got to fight with the Dark Kaoru!

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know if he was hiding here.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
His abilities have improved significantly with the Dark Kaoru today.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I wonder if it's related to the mask you gave me.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That mask is the bath I've been using since I was little.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It doesn't have any special power.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
World Loneliness

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How much do you know about him?

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
World Loneliness?

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Loneliness?

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you saying that he's lonely?

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Seidaku Souken

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What's your name?

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm Tsukimiya.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When did you meet Takeru Narihira?

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Six days ago.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I met him at the Badai Ochi, who was chasing after his injuries.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What do you know about World Loneliness?

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Really?

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Haraoki!

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you doing to Tsukimiya-san?!

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's calm down.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm going to finish you off.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's hot.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Tsukimiya-san! Are you okay?!

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well...

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What did you do to Haraoki?!

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Seimei-sama...

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was attacked by a target!

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What?!

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Seijomaa, welcome back!

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I heard you're done eating. Let's eat together!

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No, I'm fine.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I see.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What did you do to Haraoki?

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I was talking about the story of the Hundred-Year Night's dance.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What happened after that?

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well...

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Maybe he's lost his memory after that.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What are you talking about?

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Anyway, he can't believe it.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He looks like a good person.

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But I've heard a lot of rumors.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Rumors?

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That he's conducting a human body experiment on the Denji Heian Temple.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yami Kaoru was angry because Seimei-sama was appointed as the head of the Onmyo family.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's crazy.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Please don't get close to him anymore!

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's hard because he was chosen as the opponent.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But I'm sure I'll be fine.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He'll protect me no matter what happens.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Takeru-kun, who woke up alone a thousand years ago.

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, thanks to Tsukimiya-san!

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That side gave me strength.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I was able to lower the power of the night.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I see.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The night-slaying.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, the night-slaying.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I was invincible.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Anyway, I'm glad you're safe.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The one who shines in that mountain is the moon, the stars, or the fireflies.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If it's a moon star, it's a god.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If it's a firefly, it's a tracetam.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Huh? What's that?

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
A magic.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Your life is important too.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Thanks.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's give a round of applause to the two brave students!

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, Atsunaga-kun was chosen!

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm so happy.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to go now.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Huh? Where?

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Tsukimiya-san, I have a favor to ask.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You were chosen!

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm glad.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What are you doing?

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I've been here many times.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Huh? But what do you want?

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I came to celebrate and cook for you.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Huh?

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm going to eat what you made.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Eat?

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How is it? It smells good, doesn't it?

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll call you too.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't talk to me like that!

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Although the order was broken, you're the one who's going to save the life.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll do it.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll do it.

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll do it.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a hair tie that Tsukimiya-san used.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What?

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Congratulations on your promotion!

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why did you make this food?

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Sorry.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
In the first place, you don't have the right to celebrate.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't say that.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We're friends who fought together and fought.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Huh? Are you dreaming?

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Are you watching this?

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Besides, I feel like I can get along with you no matter what kind of shape you are.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What do you mean?

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Eat it for now! We'll talk about it later.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's delicious!

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, you know that you've lost the game over and over again in the 100-year night school.

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, that's what it is.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Did you really come from the outside world?

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There's a mission assistant.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mission assistant?

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Mission assistant means that all residents of the Denji Heian priesthood in order to manage the recyclable items die right after they're born.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's old school that way.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We've done it since...

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Anyway, let's talk about the 100-year night school.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You two must be careful that Shinagami uses the 3-sword.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,380
A seven-claw?

199
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,300
Does the Demon God use it?

200
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,100
I don't remember seeing such a record in the past.

201
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,840
That's why we're going to have a match this time.

202
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,060
And the enemy isn't just the Demon God.

203
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,720
There are demons too, and they're going to block our attacks.

204
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,060
Demons too, huh?

205
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,940
I'll take care of them.

206
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,940
Take care of them?

207
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,600
You saw it before.

208
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm not an enemy of demons like I am now.

209
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Well, a lot has changed.

210
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
It's not certain, but...

211
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,560
There's no harm in keeping a safe distance.

212
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
What do you think of what he's saying?

213
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
He's certainly leaving reality.

214
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,560
But I don't think he's lying.

215
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Did you say that because you got it?

216
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
No.

217
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
The dumplings were delicious.

218
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Huh?

219
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
There's nothing wrong with a person who can cook such delicious food.

220
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
What's with that logic?

221
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
I'll definitely protect you.

222
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,560
The Demon God

223
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,560
The Demon God

224
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
What's this?

225
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
What are you doing here?

226
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
I want to know.

227
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,560
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

228
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,560
I'm making a path to the Demon World.

229
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
It's my job.

230
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,560
I don't know what you're thinking, but...

231
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I'll win this Hundred Years Night.

232
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
I'm counting on you.

233
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
I hope you win this time.

234
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
This time?

235
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
What do you mean?

236
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Are you really looping?

237
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
It's starting.

238
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,560
If you don't hurry, you won't be able to participate in the fight.

239
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Damn it!

240
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Is it okay?

241
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Just like Nobana?

242
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,560
You might understand it with this Hundred Years Night.

243
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Will he be a blessing for Denji Heihankyo...

244
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,560
If I Like It

245
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,980
Monster Jorgancrver Undrawing

246
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Now, what are you going to do?

247
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Attack the Takeru's Jogen with full power?

248
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
It doesn't matter.

249
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
I don't like the speed!

250
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Just like the previous guy...

251
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
If I can defeat the Seven-Sword...

252
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,560
I'll just hunt down the demons!

253
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
This is...

254
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I've been alone for a thousand years!

255
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
I'm going to destroy the Takeru's Jogen!

256
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
I've been alone for a thousand years!

257
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
I've finished hunting down the demons!

258
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
There they are!

259
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm going to attack them!

260
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
One of the five levels!

261
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Target destroyed!

262
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Here I come!

263
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
I won't let you get away from them!

264
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Four-Sword God, Tenkou Korai!

265
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
How's that?

266
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Not yet!

267
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
He's starting to walk!

268
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Is he a Shichieboda?

269
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
I won't let you get away!

270
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
This is...

271
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
His left leg!

272
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
When did he get in?

273
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
The Demon God's Takeru!

274
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
The Demon God's power is increasing!

275
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,560
He's not even seven steps ahead!

276
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
No! He's not a Shichieboda!

277
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,560
He's converting the blow he received into his own power!

278
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
At the same time, the Daishikijin's movements are also blocked.

279
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
There he is!

280
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Yura!

281
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
He's holding on!

282
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
He won't let his guard down!

283
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
I'm going to kill you!

284
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
You're not going to do anything like that!

285
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
One more time!

286
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
This is bad!

287
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
I...

288
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
The Demon God is also sending his power?

289
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Over there?

290
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
We're in trouble if this continues!

291
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
Yura, let's hold on for a while!

292
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
I understand!

293
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Don't get in my way!

294
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Is this a combination?

295
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
That guy is fast!

296
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I'll finish you off!

297
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Turn!

298
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Take this!

299
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Nice batting!

300
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
We have to hurry!

301
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Is he sending his power from here?

302
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
What?

303
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
His power?

304
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
We don't have time!

305
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
Let's go at once!

306
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
The Demon God's power is increasing!

307
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
He's coming!

308
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Over there!

309
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
He's coming!

310
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
I'll finish you off!

311
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
I'll finish you off!

312
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
I'll finish you off!

313
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
I'll finish you off!

314
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
I'll finish you off!

315
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
The combination is complete!

316
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
The Demon God is sending his power!

317
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
He's sending his power!

318
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
He's sending his power!

319
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
He's sending his power!

320
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
The Demon God is sending his power!

321
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
He's sending his power!

322
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
It's too early to be happy!

323
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Let's go after him!

324
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
I did it!

325
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
You're going to do it again?

326
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
You...

327
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
That's enough!

328
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
The Demon God is sending his power!

329
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Kajiki...

330
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Are you Kajiki?

331
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
What is this?

332
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Is there someone?

333
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
What is this?

334
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
Hey!

335
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Stop it!

336
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Don't get in my way!

337
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
If you don't kill the demon, you won't be able to say victory!

338
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
You don't understand?

339
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
The opponent is a human!

340
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
What is he doing?

341
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
It can't be...

342
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Move aside!

343
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Move aside!

344
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Look closely at him!

345
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Why are you getting in my way?

346
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Haruki...

347
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Lord Sumei...

348
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
What's going on?

349
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
The demon is running away!

350
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
The demon looks like a human.

351
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
This is real!

352
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,560
I was shown a ghost!

353
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,560
You can see the world's rules.

354
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
The rules are...

355
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Loneliness.

356
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
The weak become the winners.

357
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
The strong become the losers.

358
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,560
That is the natural rule.

359
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
What are you saying?

360
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Is this your doing too?

361
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Explain!

362
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
What did you say?

363
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Luna...

364
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Damn it!

365
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Take this!

366
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
The demon...

367
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
The demon!

368
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
And so...

00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Your death is all in vain.

370
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I look forward to seeing you again.

371
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,560
I want to see the continuation of this.

372
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,560
I want to see the continuation of this.

373
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,560

I want to see the continuation of this.

375
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
I want to see the continuation of this.

376
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560

I want to see the continuation of this.

385
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:37,060
At a place like this, I want to look up at the moon in the sky forever.

386
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:42,560
I'm still, still, turning around.

387
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,520
No matter what world I pass through.

388
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Sun on your mark.
