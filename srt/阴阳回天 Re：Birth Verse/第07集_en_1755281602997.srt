1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The next day

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And so...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
All of your goals will be fulfilled.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I look forward to seeing you again.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What was that?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What was that, Hareraki?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll never accept that horrible future.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Damn it.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Um...

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Is something bothering you?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're a human, aren't you?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're not a demon, are you?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You'll know when you see it.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I see.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Huh? This isn't the usual stage.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Grandpa, where's the night watch?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Stage? There's nothing like that.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Huh? Then what about Tsukimiya?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who are you?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Huh?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You've been talking weird stuff all along, and you're the one who's bad.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Wait a minute! Isn't this the Denji Heian Temple?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah. It's the Denji Heian Temple, of course.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Denji Heian Temple

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The Denji Heian Temple

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Denji Heian Temple

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The Denji Heian Temple

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The Denji Heian Temple

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The Denji Heian Temple

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The Denji Heian Temple

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The Denji Heian Temple

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's different. It's really different.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yorozuya...

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's changed.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That tower wasn't like that before.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There's a mark of darkness here.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Wada-san! Wada-san!

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Huh? What?

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You don't know me, do you?

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Ichizawa, where's Tsukimiya-san?

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Huh? Tsukimiya? Who?

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're kidding! Then who are you?

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're so rude.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm Wada, a famous Kanamonoye in Wada.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Kanamonoye? Wait, who's that?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's the life of Abeno, right? The one who rules the temple.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's not changed.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Atsunaga!

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Atsunaga? Don't you remember?

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This hole. It's because he lost because of the dark scent.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Huh? Wait!

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then what happened to him?

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He died!

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't like it. The recent temple...

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Atsunaga...

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He died?

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why did the past change?

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What?

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You!

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wait!

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Huh? Where did he go?

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hey, you're going to die in a second.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Huh?

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Come to think of it, I've never seen this before.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A garbage dump?

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Isn't that a stage?

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a mystery!

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Then what's that?

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't understand!

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have to ask him.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This time, it's here.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Narihira Takeru.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Shino.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes!

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Here I go!

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
From Dainaru, to Kennaru, to Genkou Ritei.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Everything begins with Torite.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That is, the heaven is right here.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The timing is too good!

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yami Kaoru is in danger.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The area around the temple is in danger.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
70 people are present.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I have to protect him from the demon.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But...

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
A Shikigami?

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is the middle of the earth, right?

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank goodness! You're alive!

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Jena...

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you doing?

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Stop!

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's another Shikigami.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why are you moving?

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yura?

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is this Omiyaji?

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've never seen her face before.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yura! Isn't that Shikigami Atsunaga?

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't mess with me!

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Anyway, get away!

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yura!

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I know!

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Here I go!

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Stop!

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What are you doing fighting Shikigamis?

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Damn!

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Come here!

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I've been here for a thousand years!

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The Yasha-Oroshi is complete!

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Shikigami Atsunaga!

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry!

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I won't stop you even if you try!

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You guys, cool off!

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can see the world's rules, right?

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Narihira Take...

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Haraaki...

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You just called my name.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That means you're also doing a time leap.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You planned all this nonsense?

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a good opportunity.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I understand.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
First, let's solve your two misunderstandings.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Misunderstandings?

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
First, I don't know how to go back in time.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In other words, I'm not doing a time leap.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Then why do you know about me?

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I've been thinking about this for a long time, but I can conclude it.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Second, you're not doing a time leap either.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I've repeated the same thing over and over again and saved everyone!

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll accept this world without Tsukimiya-san!

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have to go back to the past and save everyone!

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you're ready to learn the truth about what's going to happen, then you can do it.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Are you hiding something?

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This world is a collection of many times.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It creates the axis of time, the past, the future, and the present.

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The axis of time has a lot of possibilities, and countless axes of time are created.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If the axis of time is the world, then the number of axes that occur here as the basis is called the parallel world.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you talking about?

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
By the way, there are 100 parallel worlds in the E.E.A.

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
100?

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Each E.E.A. has a slight difference, and the lives of the E.E.A. exist 100 times, and the residents of the E.E.A. also exist 100 times.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You, who didn't exist in this world, seem to be the only one who exists.

143
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So what does that parallel world have to do with anything?

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You said you were repeating the time travel, but that's a mistake.

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When you were facing death, you were flying in this parallel world with some power.

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That wasn't a time leap?

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes. The circumstances that happened changed, didn't they?

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
When you say that...

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I share the memories of parallel worlds.

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's why I was able to recognize your parallel world movement.

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And I'll say no, but your ability is probably what you originally had.

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
My power...

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Wait! Why are we fighting each other over parallel worlds?

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's the same with the 100th Night of the Last 100 Years.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We were supposed to be fighting demons, but we've become humans.

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is your own information!

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes, that's my power.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It seems that it has disappeared from your hands, but the E.E.A. has the effect of showing the human and the Shikigami of parallel worlds to strange demons.

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That means...

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
In their eyes, the Shikigami in front of them looks like a demon.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're so stubborn, you demon!

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What you're seeing right now is the truth.

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Wait...

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So the demons that I fought over the 100th Night of the Last 100 Years...

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's a lie...

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That time... That time...

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What was I fighting with?

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wait! Could it be...

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You're so good.

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The effect of the E.E.A. is not limited to the Shikigami or Onmyoji.

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, it has a meaning in that final team.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And you saw the truth at that time, right?

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's a lie...

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hey, tell me it's a lie!

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The E.E.A. was created by the hearts of the people.

177
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's to keep people from realizing that they're killing each other.

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're so annoying!

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Damn it!

180
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I've seen that power many times.

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But I just need to build the source of power.

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The world's best of the world, which is full of darkness.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No!

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
See? I knew it.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Why did you do this?

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
For the better future of this world.

187
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What's wrong with this?

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You've been trying to change the future since you came to this world.

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The future where the loved ones die, the future where friends die.

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
People can't easily accept unexpected events.

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Everyone wants to have hope in the future.

192
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If the worst future is waiting, you want to avoid it, right?

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let go of me!

194
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll ask you one thing.

195
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What happened to the E.E.A. in the future where you were?

196
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
When I first saw you, you were dressed in a very different culture.

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I guess the E.E.A. is probably destroyed in the world where you were.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, it's a long time ago.

199
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's wrong with that?

200
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Is the future okay to be decided?

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If the world of the Pacific continues, I want to find that possibility.

202
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But the more time passes, the less possibility it will have.

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But I created the 100 parallel worlds on the horizon axis a thousand years ago.

204
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's an experiment that shows whether there's a possibility of connecting even one.

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But the world's lifespan is 100 years.

206
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Until then, I wanted to absorb the experience gained from each and every world.

207
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
To gain experience, I needed to fight parallel worlds.

208
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This is the dark side.

209
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And the 100-year night.

210
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I will take over the last world and all the experience.

211
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Japan is a comparison of culture.

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The fight of people is the fastest way to measure the scale of culture.

213
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I will create the world of the 100-year world once a century.

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And then I will create the world of the 100-year world again.

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And that repetition is the world's loneliness.

216
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Everything is for a better future.

217
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Then, what about the Tenji Heian mirror that I was in?

218
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The defeated Tenji Heian mirror will be taken over by the victorious Heian mirror and become a shield.

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This world we are in is one of the remaining parallel worlds.

220
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That dark side is the defeated Tenji Heian mirror.

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is the denial of the Tenji Heian mirror.

222
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't intend to stop this world's loneliness.

223
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If you know this fact and interfere,

224
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I will erase it here.

225
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What's going on with them?

226
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm watching the match.

227
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I can't help but make a few sacrifices.

228
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Can you understand?

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You've also created a lot of victims to protect your loved ones.

230
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You and I are both the same kind of?

231
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Finish him!

232
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You...

233
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Are you insane?

234
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I abandoned what I call insane a thousand years ago.

235
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm interested in your abilities.

236
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The ability to transform the world's particles, which can't be done with the Onmyou Jutsu.

237
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And the power to cross the parallel worlds even if you die.

238
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm going to destroy you.

239
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The power to cross the parallel worlds even if you die.

240
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I will thoroughly examine that power.

241
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I said I would protect you...

242
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I... I...

243
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
With my own hands...

244
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's time to eat.

245
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Kazura...

246
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You knew everything?

247
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You don't think anything?

248
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're just watching him?

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There's no reason to answer the question.

250
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't understand.

251
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What's the point of this fight?

252
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The world's loneliness is what the life wants.

253
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Who is it?

254
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're not allowed to enter here.

255
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Stop!

256
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I said stop!

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hey!

258
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're...

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Huh?

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Shikibya-san? Why?

261
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's all over later, Takeru-kun.

262
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This is a bad dream.

263
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's okay.

264
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We can do it.

265
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Right, Atsunaga?

266
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What? He ran away?

267
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

268
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The reaction of the Shikibetsu he gave me was interrupted halfway.

269
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It seems that he had a friend.

270
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He tried to stop that person.

271
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But he fell asleep when he realized it.

272
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He was not sleeping?

273
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We can't sleep well.

274
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What about his friend?

275
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He was carrying a woman, a mouse-like creature.

276
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Tsukimiya...

277
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Do you know him?

278
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
As I thought, Takeru Narihira was holding the key.

279
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's been moving for a thousand years.

280
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He's not injured.

281
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
There seems to be no other device.

282
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's Tsukimiya-san, right?

283
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes.

284
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Can't you trust him?

285
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No.

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Everyone in this world didn't know about Tsukimiya-san.

287
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This world?

288
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You knew about the Reiji Heian-kyo's refusal, didn't you?

289
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's a bad dream.

290
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This world, and Hareaki, and me...

291
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Takeru-kun is different.

292
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I've always been watching you.

293
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You suddenly appeared in the Reiji Heian-kyo,

294
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and overcame the Onmyoji,

295
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
trying to fight against the worst future.

296
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I wanted you to fight together because you were like that.

297
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Fight?

298
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The world is lonely.

299
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I can't allow that annoying ritual to continue.

300
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Did Tsukimiya-san know about it?

301
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes.

302
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The worst future that life is trying to create.

303
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I came from the moon to stop it.

304
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The moon?

305
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Life is a game of life.

306
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
A game of life that can't be played.

307
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm going to play a game of magic.

308
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm going to fool everyone.

309
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

310
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

311
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

312
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

313
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

314
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

315
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

316
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

317
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

318
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

319
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

320
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

321
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

322
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

323
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

325
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

327
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

328
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

329
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

331
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

332
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

333
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

334
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

335
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

336
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

337
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

338
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

339
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

340
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

341
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

342
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

343
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

344
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

345
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

346
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

347
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

348
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

349
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

350
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

351
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

352
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

353
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

354
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

355
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

356
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

357
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm going to make them laugh.

358
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
