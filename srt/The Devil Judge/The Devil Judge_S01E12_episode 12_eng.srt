1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,570


2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,960
 Ji Sung 

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,390
 Kim Min Jung 

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,400
 Jin Young 

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,620
 Park Gyu Young 

6
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,230
 NO JUSTICE 

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,440
 Devil Judge 

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,550
 This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea.  All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional. 

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,310
 Episode 12 

10
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,270
I want to consider it while I smoke this.

11
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,890
Could you step out for a moment?

12
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,260
Let me check your ID.

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,140
I am Lieutenant Yun Su Hyeon of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

14
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,330
It's confirmed.

15
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,180
  Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui  

16
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,530
Kang Yo Han?

17
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,030
Just back away.

18
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,470
You, get up from there. Quickly get up.

19
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,070
S-Su Hyeon...

20
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,980
Ga On... What are you doing right now?

21
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,120
Why are you here?

22
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,360
- Su Hyeon— 
 - I asked you what you're doing here!

23
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,090
She committed suicide.

24
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,130
We just found the body when we came here to interrogate her.

25
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,600
Are you going to arrest us?

26
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,560
Yun Su Hyeon.

27
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,970
- Su Hyeon ... 
 - Leave.

28
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,950
I told you to leave.

29
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,270
We have to go.

30
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,100
Yun Su Hyeon, speaking.

31
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,750
Minister Cha Gyeong Hui committed suicide in her office.

32
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,100
I will preserve the site, so please send back up quickly.

33
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,060
  Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui  

34
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,130
Prosecutor General, Wait... What are you saying?

35
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,840
Cha Gyeong Hui is dead?

36
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,160
 There's a file I have been collecting. 

37
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,180
 I'm going to hand it over to Kang Yo Han. 

38
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,090
Send someone straight to the Minister's office.

39
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,540
I'm sure she kept it close to herself.

40
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,730
You must find it, got it?

41
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,030
 Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui, for whom an arrest warrant was about to be issued,  

42
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,580
 was found dead in her office. 

43
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,990
 A Metropolitan Investigation Unit detective, who was visiting Minister Cha for an interview, first discovered the scene. 

44
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,170
 -  

45
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,220
 It is clear that the deceased made an extreme choice on her own,  

46
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,420
 and there were no other suspicious circumstances. 

47
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,780
 The police think she had specific reasons for her extreme choice– 

48
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,790
Do you feel relieved now?

49
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,070
Kim Ga On.

50
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,190
I'm sorry. It's not your fault either.

51
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,390
It's hard but it's already happened.

52
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,380
Forget it completely.

53
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,140
Are you telling me to forget it?

54
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,530
You're saying forget it completely.

55
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,340
Think about the next step.

56
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,280
This plan failed.

57
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,020
The file Cha Gyeong Hui had compiled

58
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,950
must have fallen into Heo Jung Se's hands.

59
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,320
Tobacco is so harmful to our body. How did Minister Cha like it so much to smoke like this?

60
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,910
You died in vain.

61
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,050
Su Hyeon...

62
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,120
Su Hyeon!

63
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,070
Please, Su Hyeon.

64
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,790
Su Hyeon!

65
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,830
Do you have any idea of what I did because of you?

66
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,650
I got rid of the evidence... the evidence.

67
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:47,060
How could you do such a terrible thing? How could you?

68
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,940
I'm sorry Su Hyeon... Sorry.

69
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,660
What on earth have you been doing with Kang Yo Han?

70
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,990
Never...

71
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,160
Never ever...

72
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,510
Never appear in front of me again, Kim Ga On.

73
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,980
 Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah 

74
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,880
 Congratulations, Young Master.  

75
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,330
Cha Gyeong Hui was removed as you wanted.

76
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,090
You worked hard. That is thanks to you.

77
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,240
Am I receiving words of thanks from you, Young Master?

78
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,850
 This is the beginning. Now that the next presidential candidate is gone. 

79
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,470
The Social Responsibility Foundation will find someone to replace her.

80
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,300
Leave it to me.

81
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,050
 Let's push Kang Yo Han forward, now that we're already here. 

82
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,710
I am going to make it all happen.

83
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,460
Okay. But since it's like this, you should make me a director at the foundation.

84
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,650
I want to take part in the Dream Village business.

85
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,170
You're being greedy. Don't rush yourself.

86
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,030
One step at a time.

87
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,080
Yes, Judge Kang.

88
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,550
 - Find Kim Ga On.  
 - Pardon?

89
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,660
 He isn't feeling himself right now. 

90
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,370
Find him and bring him to me.

91
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,500
Before he does something bad.

92
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,640
  Understood. 

93
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,790
You came out late.

94
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,780
What is it about?

95
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,160
As far as I know, Cha Gyeong Hui's case has been sorted out.

96
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,490
You cleaned it up yourself, Lieutenant Yun Su Hyeon.

97
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,680
Quit now.

98
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,790
If you don't quit now, I will arrest you.

99
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,750
With my own hands.

100
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,610
Do as you please.

101
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,170
Please leave Ga On out of this.

102
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,310
I'm begging you.

103
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,080
Please don't make Ga On waver. Please.

104
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,460
Take off your hands.

105
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,990
I said take off your hands.

106
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,050
Thank you for the food.

107
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,870
Isn't it the young judge from TV?

108
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,590
You are way much better in real!

109
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,310
A selfie is okay, right?

110
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,730
I'm sorry. Please go back to your seats.

111
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,820
Don't be like that. Let's just take one pic. We've been watching you.

112
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,310
- It's because we're your fans. 
 - One, two ...

113
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,730
Ah, really!

114
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,710
Judge Kim.

115
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,700
You're very drunk.

116
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,380
Did Judge Kang order you to come and get me?

117
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,380
Is he afraid that I would make a mess?

118
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,700
I'm sorry if it made you feel bad.

119
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,980
In the end, Cha Gyeong Hui paid for her crime. With her own hands.

120
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,350
I'm not sure. I don't feel anything.

121
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,220
I've been thinking about getting revenge,

122
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,320
but now that it actually happened, I feel empty.

123
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,660
Judge Kim.

124
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,290
Yes?

125
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,100
Don't get too involved.

126
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,850
What do you mean?

127
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm a man with nothing to lose, but aren't you different?

128
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,070
If you stay with Judge Kang,

129
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,870
you'll eventually lose everything.

130
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,680
Even yourself.

131
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,990
You're here.

132
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,590
Yes.

133
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,310
I heard you visited Yun Su Hyeon.

134
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,360
Are you going to meet Yun Su Hyeon at a time when you have so many eyes on you?

135
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,190
Are you out of your mind? 
 - Why?

136
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,180
Are you afraid that I might have blown up your plan?

137
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,510
Do you think this fight is a joke?!

138
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,310
It's a matter of  life or death even if I put everything on the line.

139
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,900
How long do I have to keep up with you playing house?

140
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,720
I put everything on the line, too.

141
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,180
Do you have any idea

142
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,320
how I feel while  helping you?!

143
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,030
Even though a person was dead in front of me, the first thing that came to my mind was...

144
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,050
 We must hurry to find the files first. 

145
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,070
What kind of monster am I becoming?

146
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,050
It may be hard, but it can't be helped.

147
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,340
You know what kind of bastards we're dealing with. Right?

148
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,930
Now they're going to be tougher.

149
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,520
I don't know what's going to happen.

150
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,490
Your childhood friend

151
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,260
came to see me today.

152
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,080
She said if I don't stop, she'll arrest me.

153
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,070
If you want to save the world,

154
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,820
cut Yun Su Hyeon out of your life.

155
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,250
You can't help me and be friends with her at the same time.

156
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,390
For me,

157
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,840
Su Hyeon is the world.

158
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,120
You're here?

159
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,470
Did you fight with Yo Han?

160
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,830
That's not it.

161
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,930
Then why are you leaving this house?

162
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,270
I can't live here forever.

163
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,250
I also have my own house.

164
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,990
But you are leaving so suddenly.

165
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,860
Of course, I don't care, but someone could try to retaliate.

166
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,470
Like those Bamboo Spear guys or whatever.

167
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,690
This house will be safe.

168
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,900
I guess Yo Han might have a guilty conscience.

169
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,200
So he installed a security system at the level of a fortress, like CCTVs or the alarms—

170
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,160
Elijah.

171
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,380
I'm sorry.

172
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,800
I couldn't stay with you until the end.

173
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm very sorry.

174
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,050
Then you're really going?

175
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,770
From time to time, do you want to come over to my house? I'll make you delicious food.

176
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,760
Where would I go in this state?

177
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,590
  I don't believe in God,   

178
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:43,630
  but for that one night I prayed to an unknown being.  

179
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,860
 Just in case, if you are too tired, you have to tell me.  

180
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,880
 Thanks. 

181
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,480
 Did you have a nightmare? 

182
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,810
 Are you all right? 

183
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,620
 I pray that everyone in this house 

184
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,960
 has a night with no tears or nightmares.  

185
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,110
Why did you make him leave?

186
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,770
He left by himself. It was his own choice.

187
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,620
This house is more safe and nice.

188
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,440
Why did you make him leave after making him do all those dangerous things?

189
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,750
Since when have you been worried about others like this?

190
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,810
You could've stopped him at least once!

191
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,730
He's not your father.

192
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,830
- What? 
 - You heard me.

193
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,410
He's not your father.

194
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,490
You're going to get hurt if you keep deluding yourself.

195
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,600
  Elijah, my words were a bit harsh. 

196
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,480
- Shut it! 
 - Elijah.

197
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,810
Why are you doing something so out of character?

198
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,660
Yo Han doesn't do things like apologies.

199
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,210
Elijah.

200
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,040
Just act like you normally do.

201
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,900
Would you please get lost?

202
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:57,130
As we send our condolences to Minister Cha Gyeong Hui, cheers.

203
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,030
Should we have set up a table for her or something?

204
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,470
This time, Director Jeong, you worked hard.

205
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,990
Cha Gyeong Hui, that woman was like a crazy pony

206
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,090
and went around poking her nose in everything.

207
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,560
I had such a headache because of that.

208
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,620
It's my job.

209
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,490
How could I ignore a threat to the foundation?

210
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,590
Whenever she looked at me with her laser-sharp eyes,

211
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,980
I had a big knot in the pit of my stomach and felt like dying.

212
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,470
Chairman Park, you must feel so relieved now.

213
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,600
I mean money and power is good,

214
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,960
but people need to live like people.

215
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,290
She always pointed out flaws and threatened people.

216
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,690
So look how she ended up.

217
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,620
How many flaws could you possibly have

218
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,810
to make you tremble in fear like that, our scaredy-cat Chairman Park?

219
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,200
And you're so confident?

220
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,250
You don't think I know you're trying to obtain citizenship from the Dominican Republic?

221
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,200
Right. You must be happy you've already become a Dominican Republic citizen.

222
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,670
I mean you're not even a Korean citizen. Go back to your country.

223
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,080
Ah, really. Be quiet.

224
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,130
Enough with the chit chat. The game isn't over yet.

225
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,140
Chairwoman Jeong, we need to continue with the next step.

226
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,100
Which step?

227
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,970
There is still a threat to the foundation.

228
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,280
Kang Yo Han.

229
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,870
That's right. We raised a tiger.

230
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,000
Instead of getting rid of him, it'll be safer to bring him in, since he has grown too big.

231
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,400
How? How will you bring him in?

232
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,540
He is ambitious.

233
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,490
Hasn't he already made his intentions known?

234
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,800
  Does it have to be Cha Gyeong Hui? 

235
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,590
 So does the person who protects your assets  

236
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,820
  need to be Cha Gyeong Hui? 

237
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,070
Now Cha Gyeong Hui is gone.

238
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:58,890
If we promise him the next term's presidency , then Kang Yo Han will be a very reliable—

239
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:03,300
The next term... is the next term's presidency really necessary?

240
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,610
President, a presidential election is only two years away—

241
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:13,780
Wait. Is a presidential election really needed?

242
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:31,030
When the country is in crisis, democracy is a luxury.

243
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,250
That's true.

244
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,550
A crisis as in..?

245
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,790
Why? Is there not enough of a crisis?

246
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,830
Should I make more of a crisis?

247
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,160
Chairwoman Jeong, I'm so disappointed in you.

248
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,920
Next term's presidency? We should promise him the next term's presidency? To that bastard, Kang Yo Han?

249
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,700
- But, Kang Yo Han is useful, so rather than getting rid of him—

250
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,950
You slept with him.   Did you sleep with him?

251
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,520
How dare you say such vulgar words?

252
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,510
Oh, please. You've gotten so serious. It's a joke.

253
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,760
So why are you trying so hard to protect him?

254
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,940
It was a joke.

255
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,990
Chairwoman Jeong, do you know that Cha Gyeong Hui barged in here

256
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,820
and said to us before she died?

257
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,020
What did she say?

258
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,690
She said if we didn't help her,

259
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,020
then she would send everything that happened in the foundation to Kang Yo Han.

260
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,010
Kang Yo Han asked Cha Gyeong Hui for that info.

261
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:47,660
Kang Yo Han tried to completely destroy us! Using your hands!

262
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,150
Not even knowing you're being used and spouting nonsense

263
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,630
acting like the support team leader...

264
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,010
Wake up and snap out of it!

265
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,440
Don't act like a little girl who's gone crazy over a stupid boy!

266
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,450
Get your head straight!

267
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,890
I kept complimenting the  job you were doing, and now you really think you're all that?

268
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,890
You're here.

269
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,590
What could be going on, that made Su Hyeon want to meet with me?

270
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,490
So how have you been?

271
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,010
What's wrong?

272
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,960
Is something going on?

273
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,120
Yes.

274
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,920
Did you call me, Supreme Court Justice?

275
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,920
Have a seat.

276
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,780
What's this about?

277
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,260
What are you making Ga On do?

278
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,640
Do you know how that kid lived,

279
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,120
how he survived that hell, for him to come all the way here?

280
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,930
There is hell for everyone, Supreme Court Justice.

281
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,630
And he is not a child.

282
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,210
I'm not going to sit still. I'll figure out what's going on somehow.

283
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,060
If you figure it out, then Kim Ga On will get hurt too.

284
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,310
Because it was a crime.

285
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,410
You must've not heard all the details.

286
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,890
Did you not hear it directly from Kim Ga On?

287
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,590
You must have heard about it from Yun Su Hyeon. What did she say?

288
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,250
It sounded as if you were making Ga On do something dangerous,

289
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,440
but I guess it was more than that.

290
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,120
A crime? Did you say it was a crime?

291
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,470
It was you who made him do something dangerous.

292
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,060
Didn't you send him to me?

293
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,130
What are you so proud of?! How can you be so shameless?!

294
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,420
Are you sure everything you do is justice?!

295
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,800
I have never mistaken myself to be just.

296
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,950
I'm just making a choice.

297
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,330
So far,

298
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,970
I haven't had that many options.

299
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:05,230
It's either just accept everything or fight everything,

300
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,540
and that fellow also made a choice by himself.

301
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,310
Continue on or stop here, that choice is for him to make.

302
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,840
Fight everything?

303
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,190
You seem to think you're fighting a monstrous world.

304
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,230
If you look into the abyss for a long time, the abyss will also look into you.

305
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,510
You have to stop.

306
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,050
You are ruining the world.

307
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,930
I think you're misunderstanding.

308
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,330
I am the abyss.

309
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,490
 Yes, Judge. 

310
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,970
I think you should keep an eye on Min Jeong Ho. And ...

311
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,800
 Yes. 

312
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,240
Kim Ga On, too.

313
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,180
I got it, Judge.

314
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,460
 The anger, I understand that. 

315
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,890
 Even if no one in this world understands, 

316
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:37,320
 I understand that feeling. 

317
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,720
 I was hoping that you would join my side. 

318
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,930
 I would have done worse, if necessary.  

319
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:50,450
 Switching him. Or whatever else. That's how I do things.  

320
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,820
 And that won't change in the future. 

321
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,320
 It's not just for revenge. 

322
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,190
 Then? 

323
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,130
 I want to fight the world that's gone wrong. 

324
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,170
 What kind of monster am I becoming? 

325
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,100
What are you doing?

326
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,200
Do you want some?

327
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,770
I have a different one.

328
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,250
What is that?

329
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,830
Young Master Ga On prepared this before he left.

330
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:38,290
It's jeyuk-bokkeum and doenjang-jjigae.
  (stir-fried spicy pork and soybean paste stew) 

331
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,270
Come and eat.

332
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,920
If it looks delicious, you should eat with me.

333
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,190
Excuse me?!

334
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,800
I am just kidding.

335
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,800
How can a person who has never even made a joke before, make a joke like that?

336
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,300
Is he getting old?

337
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,960
They say you don't realize someone's presence much but absence makes the heart grow fonder.

338
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,780
This house feels so empty.

339
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,590
You should be good to people when they are still around.

340
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,410
 Will you be all right? I think you'll really regret it. 

341
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,340
 - Don't lie– 
 - I'll give you one last chance. 

342
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,370
 Aye, you're just saying that for nothing. 

343
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,760
 What, again?  

344
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,690
 Your calling is to be a cop. How is that every time you draw a card, you draw out a thief? 

345
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,140
 You're dead. 

346
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,220
 No, it would be better if you were a gangster.  

347
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,690
 These hands have a thirst for blood. You're going to catch a lot of them. 

348
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,760
 - Hey! Kim Ga On! 
 - Hey! 

349
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,020
 - You're here. 
 - You're here. 

350
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,960
 I should join in, too. 

351
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,470
 It doesn't look you would do better. 

352
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,130
 Elijah, we'll bet your allowance. 

353
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,680
 Ah, this month will be very abundant. You're all dead. 

354
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,730
 Let's play. The Chief doesn't know how to do it, so I will mix it. 

355
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,300
 Okay. I'm going to divide it into three. 

356
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,400
 Mix, mix, mix. 

357
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,510
 It's okay if humanity gets destroyed, 

358
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,420
 as long as you guys are here. 

359
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,940
 Phone 
 Gangster 

360
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,240
 The subscriber you're calling is not available right now.  

361
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,830
 Please try again later. 

362
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,870
Grandma!

363
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,450
Hello, Grandma.

364
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,450
You're here again?

365
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,090
You're happy to see me now, right?

366
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,550
I'm not happy to see you.

367
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:33,150
Why do you keep asking me about the fire, people's deaths, and such horrid things?

368
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,090
Grandma.

369
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,530
The man I was looking for, the one who worked at the cathedral, I looked him up.

370
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:43,950
But I think his name is a baptismal name, Jeong Joseph. I just cannot find him.

371
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,420
By chance, do you know his real name?

372
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,120
Or where he moved to?

373
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,000
I'm not sure. Jeong Joseph?

374
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,560
You said it's Jeong Joseph?

375
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,320
 Jeong Joseph 

376
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,310
Yes, Judge. Min Jeong Ho's movements are unusual.

377
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,610
 He is meeting with the opposition party assembly members and reporters one by one. 

378
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,150
All right. Check it out well.

379
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,270
If a strange article comes out, immediately prepare to publish an article refuting it.

380
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,250
Yes. And there is one strange thing.

381
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,020
Are you talking about the Bamboo Spear guy?

382
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,950
Did you already know?

383
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,110
Did he run away?

384
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,100
 He broke his electronic anklet and ran away, 

385
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,100
 but both the police and the prosecution are moving. 

386
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,020
Heo Jung Se must have been behind it.

387
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,960
Does he have nothing to be afraid of now?

388
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,890
He's trying to do something big, earnestly.

389
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:40,250
Supreme Court Justice, isn't this premature?

390
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,240
We don't have enough evidence yet and–

391
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,430
It's too late to wait for the right time.

392
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,520
Let's raise the question, whether it works or not.

393
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,750
Shouldn't we at least leave a statement that

394
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,950
there were other voices

395
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,020
in this era too?

396
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,930
All right, Supreme Court Justice. I'll set up a press conference.

397
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:10,180
Judge Kang Yo Han is now driving this country into madness and violence.

398
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:15,140
He's made students tie up weak classmates and flog them,

399
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,770
and made the whole nation hunt a defendant by chasing after him

400
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,600
with the DIKE app.

401
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,200
His trial relies on surprise revelations and provoking unlawful behavior,

402
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,830
rather than rigorous evidence and deliberate procedures.

403
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,520
This is... not justice.

404
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,510
There is no easy justice in the human world.

405
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,110
I, at the risk of my Supreme Court Justice position,

406
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,010
demand the dissolution of the live court.

407
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,720
Kang Yo Han

408
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,350
needs to step down.

409
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,240
His timing is perfect.

410
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,740
Oh, you picked up quick. I need you to call him.

411
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,780
There's one more thing that needs to be done.

412
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,510
Min Jeong Ho should resign!

413
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,740
Resign! Resign!

414
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,310
The live court must continue!

415
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,640
The live court must continue!!

416
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,000
 Let's protect Judge Kang Yo Han! 
 Min Jeong Ho should resign!! 

417
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,410
I think you should ask the police for security on your way home from work.

418
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,060
- The situation is serious. 
 - It's all right.

419
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,220
They don't have to do that because of me.

420
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,780
No, but still...

421
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,590
 - Supreme Court Justice Min Jeong Ho.  
 - Who is this?

422
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:56,070
 How dare you frame our Judge Kang Yo Han? 

423
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,980
 I guess you're not afraid to die. 

424
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,510
Who are you to threaten me?!

425
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,810
 You seem to think I'm being funny. 

426
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:08,070
 Should I ask your family? If they think your life is worth it? 

427
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:08,990
What did you say?

428
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:13,320
Our Supreme Court Justice's house is very cozy.

429
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,780
 It's about you being an upright man? Or you're pretending to be upright? 

430
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:30,210
Yes. Are cops still on the way?

431
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,800
It's urgent!

432
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,630
 This morning, Supreme Court Justice Min Jeong Ho was attacked near his home 

433
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:45,360
 by a person believed to be a fanatical supporter of the live court's Judge Kang Yo Han,  

434
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,590
 and was rushed to the hospital. 

435
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:51,570
 Since yesterday's press conference demanding the dissolution of the live court,  

436
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,230
 Justice Min has been suffering from complaints and threats from dissatisfied people. 

437
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:00,970
This is a truly barbaric thing that is hard to find in a civilized society.

438
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:07,150
First of all, I sincerely wish Supreme Court Justice Min a speedy recovery.

439
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,500
I'm... I'm dumbfounded.

440
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,230
The fanatical supporters of certain judges even resort to violence.

441
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,810
This is ... Does this- Does this- Does this make any sense?

442
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:22,020
I hope that the Supreme Court will carefully consider

443
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,370
whether the live court chief judge should continue to serve as the presiding judge.

444
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,550
And, I mean,

445
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:33,370
don't have just one good judge in South Korea, right?

446
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:37,750
Shouldn't we also have a status of the judges, like K-Judge?

447
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,010
It's time to have it, okay?

448
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,950
Just lie down.

449
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,610
Last time, you went away like you would never see me again.

450
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,600
You're all right, aren't you?

451
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,550
Fortunately, they said your condition isn't critical.

452
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:30,130
I don't care what happens to a guy like me but...

453
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,900
What words...

454
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,260
... my innocent family is being harassed.

455
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:41,650
My daughter can't even go to work because my family's personal data have been disclosed on the Internet.

456
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,310
I didn't expect Kang Yo Han to act this dirtily.

457
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,680
But Professor, I don't think Kang Yo Han did this. No matter how hard it is...

458
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,900
Are you still on his side?

459
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,700
I can never forgive him.

460
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,820
It's this guy. The one who's been digging into your background.

461
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,730
- Is it? 
 - He's been helping Kang Yo Han for a long time.

462
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:48,790
He used this team leader of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit to find the records of your mother's case.

463
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,880
He's still looking into you even now.

464
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,740
From your father's case to the Seo Jeong Hak matter.

465
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,200
I got it.

466
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,930
Good work.

467
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:26,760
Yes, Chairwoman Jeong. Oh, your voice is so tempting today.

468
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,100
Let's proceed with what you were talking about.

469
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,250
That's right! Okay. I told you, we have to push through.

470
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:38,880
 I really need help from the foundation. 

471
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,300
All right.

472
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,060
Oh, and I have a favor to ask of you.

473
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,820
That Bamboo Spear, guy while he is working on this,

474
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,890
can I ask him to run a personal errand for me?

475
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,820
Bamboo Spear?

476
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,690
Sure. That's fine, that's fine.

477
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,730
Thank you.

478
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,770
 Smile, 

479
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:11,560
 you look good in this house. 

480
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,060
Hello?

481
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:42,300
Hi, Young Master.

482
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,360
What are you up to already in the morning?

483
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,160
You're too cold-hearted.

484
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,890
After taking care of Cha Gyeong Hui, you're saying we have nothing to do with each other now?

485
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,820
 That's not the case. We have to keep seeing each other from now on. 

486
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,700
We do?

487
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,590
Then, should we meet right now?

488
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,760
Right now?

489
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,350
Let's go on a date.

490
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,330
I have something I definitely want to show you.

491
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,970
Yes, hello?

492
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,690
 Judge Kim Ga On? 

493
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,070
Yes, this is he.

494
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:36,560
 If you want to save Supreme Court Justice Min Jeong Ho, come to the slums of Hyungsan-dong. 

495
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,330
Who are you?

496
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,440
 Come right now. 

497
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,940
Hel–

498
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,660
 Professor Min Jeong Ho 

499
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,220
 The subscriber you're calling is not av– 

500
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,080
 Police 

501
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,590
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

502
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:48,010
 Dear citizens, the plague virus has been found again 

503
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:51,630
 in the residential area of the Hyungsan-dong slum. 
   

504
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:56,650
 We ask for your cooperation with the measures taken by the quarantine authorities, for your life and safety. 

505
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,460
 I will say it again. 

506
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:03,160
 The plague virus has been found again in the residential area of the Hyungsan-dong slum. 

507
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,460
 We ask for your cooperation with the measure taken by the quarantine authorities,  

508
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,480
 for your life and safety. 

509
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,100
 We can get through this again. 

510
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:21,130
 No matter what difficulties we face, we can certainly overcome them. 

511
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,920
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

512
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,840
Professor.

513
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,470
Here you are!

514
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,320
It's quite romantic, for a morning date.

515
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,410
I thought it would suit your tastes.

516
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,750
The mood is nice, right?

517
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,860
What about the pendant?

518
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,120
You're so observant, too.

519
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,610
It's such a precious gift, so I kept it safe.

520
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:32,010
What if someone takes it away?

521
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,900
Would anyone dare to do that?

522
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,490
Would there be?

523
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,530
Do you find me scary, Young Master?

524
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:46,240
No. Why would I be scared of you?

525
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,580
That's good!

526
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,440
I'm so happy because you're being sweet.

527
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:02,110
By the way, Young Master,

528
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,540
why did you do that?

529
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,390
Do what?

530
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:18,530
You should have been a little more kind to me.

531
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,930
Judge!

532
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,890
Judge!

533
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,680
What are you doing?

534
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,950
Weren't we supposed to go to the top together?

535
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:03,220
I said we just need to wait two years, two more years.

536
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,670
Then we can have everything in this world.

537
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:09,760
I don't really want anything like that.

538
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:20,490
Oh, I see. You just want to destroy everything.

539
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:27,470
But why? If we clean up the trash we have now, the remaining trash will just fill their spot.

540
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:30,950
Being a leader of trashy low-lives

541
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,800
doesn't really suit my taste.

542
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,810
I see.

543
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,740
That's too bad.

544
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,400
Kill him.

545
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,500
Judge!

546
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,810
Judge!

547
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,070
You can't.

548
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,660
Judge, don't come! You can't.

549
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,900
Judge!

550
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,130
Judge!

551
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,160
Move!

552
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,290
Judge, you can't! Judge!

553
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,060
Please don't come.

554
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,150
Please don't come! Judge, please!

555
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,450
Please.

556
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:45,630
Judge, don't come! Please!

557
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:48,920
Judge!

558
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:13,760
Professor!

559
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,860
Professor!

560
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:28,350
Judge, don't come. Judge!

561
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:30,750
No, you can't! It's dangerous!

562
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:35,670
Please don't come, Judge!

563
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,830
I said not to come!

564
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:57,380
Put that down.

565
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,360
I want

566
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:07,820
you to be lonely, like me.

567
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:11,290
Then wouldn't you stay by my side?

568
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:15,740
If there's no one by your side.

569
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,770
Professor!

570
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,650
Professor.

571
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:05,920
Someone help me! No! Ajeossi!

572
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,740
Ajeossi!

573
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:14,820
 We're angry about the reconstruction that kills the common people. We oppose, oppose and oppose it again! 

574
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,470
Stop it!

575
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,340
Are you all right? Come out of there.

576
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,700
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes.

577
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,490
- Thank you. 
 - Go this way.

578
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
Ga On!

579
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,260
It's been awhile.

580
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:48,750
It's me. You don't remember me?

581
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,200
I'm going to kill you,

582
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,820
so that you die a lonely

583
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:51,350
and miserable death.

584
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,290
In a way that suits you very well.

585
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,460
Goodbye, Young Master.

586
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:27,960


587
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:34,320
 The Devil Judge 

588
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,690
♫  which has lost its light  ♫

589
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:43,330
♫  I can't breathe, I can't breathe  ♫

590
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:49,830
♫  I cannot stop it anymore, it swallows me whole  ♫

591
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,700
♫  save me from myself  ♫

592
01:08:56,110 --> 01:09:00,240
♫  Am I lost in a dense fog?  ♫

593
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,260
 Judge Oh, you just start getting prepared. 

594
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,710
 He's being attacked for fun. 

595
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,830
 This is just the beginning, Young Master. 

596
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:10,930
 Will you keep being like this?  

597
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:11,820
  That news? 

598
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,670
 It's all fake. It was fabricated by the foundation. 

599
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:18,060
 If there's no stage, then it's just one person.  

600
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,120
 Mr. Jeong Joseph? Just a moment, please. 

601
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,420
 The government is blindfolding you. 

602
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,310
 Stop him right away. Right now! 

603
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:27,560
 What Kang Yo Han really wants is... 

604
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:31,600
 I'll put you on the live court and reveal everything.
