Judge Kang, what do you think about the controversy over the constitutionality of this type of trial?

53
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,340
What about the criticism that it is just an anti-civil rights show.

54
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,360
Judge Kang is expected to be too punitive.

55
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,470
We have a concern that you lack consideration toward the socially disadvantaged.

56
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,960
- Who are the socially disadvantaged? 
 - Pardon?

57
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,330
Which of the defendants I tried was socially disadvantaged?

58
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,820
Umm, there was a juvenile offender. A homeless person. An impoverished mentally ill person.

59
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,390
Are the rapist of a classmate,  happyslapping thief,  and an outrageous murderer, socially disadvantaged? 
 (Happy slapping-- random assault to film to post on social media) 

60
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,110
- Nevertheless, to some degree, weren't they socially disadvantaged— 
 - They are just defendants.

61
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,910
I have no interest on whether someone is advantaged or disadvantaged.

62
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,230
So  can you punish severely even the defendant in this live court show trial?

I'm sorry, Supreme Court Justice.  I'm still not familiar with addressing you with this title.

Supreme Court Justice? My butt. Cut it out, you kid.

Wow, this is cool.

95
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,640
It's like a temple.

96
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,140
It is a temple.

97
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,200
It's Justice's temple.

98
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,730

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,130
Why is Judge Kang Yo Han stacking the deck like this?

101
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,830
Judge? You can't call him a judge.

102
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,170
He's the flagbearer of reform to change a corrupt judiciary.

A monster always appears during a crisis.

106
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,370
The ridiculous laws which he got enacted

107
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,140
were not the brain child of a jurist but that of a politician.

108
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,930
You dislike it so much, yet you appointed me to this court.

109
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,680
Someone needs to be there.

110
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,840
Someone has to be vigilant and keep their eyes wide open even in this insane wind.

111
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,060
There is no one here trying to resist this wind.

112
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,500
Are you ordering me to play the role of Judas Iscariot?

113
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,920
It's a request.  Do you remember what I always said in class?

114
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,980
I do.

What's wrong?

118
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,240
It's nothing, sorry. You said you were Judge Kim Ga On, correct?

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,580

Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Jin Ju.

Nice to meet you, Judge.

128
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,570
It's a bit unorganized, isn't it? I came from far away so I have a lot of belongings.

129
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,750
It's all right. But ... are you going to sleep here?

130
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,320
No. Not every day.

131
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,340
It's like ... the basics of working life? Working hard in the beginning and getting noticed.

132
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,040
Right.

133
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,480
- Judge Kim, it's your first working and it's in Seoul, right? 
 - Yes.

134
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,950
After I became a judge, I was only assigned to work in the countryside, so this is my first time working in Seoul.

135
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,050
Honestly speaking, an opportunity like this doesn't come often.

136
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,190
What's the matter? Are you an introvert?

137
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,010
No, of course not. Please take good care of me.

138
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,780
You seem different when you smile.

139
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,490
Now I get what criteria the trial court used for selecting judges.

140
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,020
When you say criteria, you mean ...

141
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,010
If I had to put it into words, it would be the image.

142
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,110
But is that related to the tasks that a judge has to do?

143
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,350
Of course. Think about it. We are the trial court in front of the citizens of this country.

144
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:23,200
But people prefer to hear the words of someone they like instead of someone who tells the truth.

145
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,620
Charm is power.

146
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,890
Power?

147
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,020
Don't pay attention to me. Don't take it to heart. I'm just in a good mood right now,

148
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,810
so words emerge without thinking.

149
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:46,290
Honestly, I'm a fan of Chief Judge Kang Yo Han.

150
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,600
Just my coming here made me hailed with blessings as a fan.

151
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,170
You've succeeded, Oh Jin Ju! Let's work hard.

152
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,760
Did you reconsider choosing JU Chemical Chairman Ju Il Do's case first?

153
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,090
That case is the most suitable.

154
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,340
There are plenty of simple and easy cases, why go through the hassle?

155
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,450
It's not complicated. We'll just do according to the law.

156
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,680
- The best law firms in South Korea will be called in to help. 
 - Of course.

157
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,210
You know that trust in the judicial system fell to 10%, right?

158
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,980
Yes.

159
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,790
Cases like this where the emotions of the public and the conclusion reached by the court can easily differ,

160
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,020
- are very difficult, so is there a need to do it so publicly—
 - Chief Justice.

161
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,520
The Live Court show is not a kangaroo court*.
  (unofficial court held by a group of people in order to try someone regarded, especially without good evidence, as guilty) 

162
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,140
It's just a transparent court. In front of all the citizens.

163
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm satisfied with that.

164
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,160
I'll get going first.

165
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,300
All right, see you tomorrow.

166
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,090
We will cross now. Raise your right hands! That's right, stick to this side.

167
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,990
You bastards!

168
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,220
Be ready to shoot.

169
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,150
 A bus is speeding towards the front entrance 200 meters away. 

170
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,830
 The driver's identity is unknown. Please let me know how we should proceed. 

171
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,490
Kids, run quickly!

172
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,590
Are you okay?

173
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,590
The guns were provided in order to be used.

174
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm sorry, Judge.

175
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,560
What are you looking at?  Stay back!

176
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,270
Are you all right, sir?

177
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,920
Someone is hurt.  He needs to go to the hospital!  Hospital!

178
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,230
 Punish Chairman Ju Il Do! 

179
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,900
 This morning in front of the Supreme Court, there was an explosion of a preschool bus. 

180
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,800
 The arrest warrant for Ju Il Do, the chairman of JU Chemical, was rejected. 

181
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,520
 angering the driver of the preschool bus 

182
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,460
 - who sped towards the Supreme Court. 
 - What is this? Was it because Chairman Ju Il Do's warrant was rejected?

183
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,230
It's just a challenge against government authority.

184
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,190
If I may, isn't it a scream of anguish rather than a challenge?

185
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,920
What do you mean by scream?

186
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,060
When you corner and trap a rat and starve it, it will struggles and bang its head on the wall.

187
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,600
Would a human being be any different?

188
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,600
Master Seo,  it's an issue regarding life or death. The foundation needs to help.

189
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,160
We were able to control the epidemic, but there are so many unemployed people that we have nobody to collect tax from.

190
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,860
If the drought lasts for a long time, there will be riots.

191
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,950
- Chairman Park. 
 - Yes?

192
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,320
Preparations for the live court are going well, right?

193
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,050
Yes, don't worry. It'll be a big day.

194
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,120
You must prepare well.

195
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,390
Our Minister Cha has special interest in the case, due to personal circumstances.

196
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,980
 Welfare for the needy 

197
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,480
 The loan of luck - We guarantee complete confidentiality. 

198
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,320
Are you trying to grow a jungle?

199
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,460
Hi.

200
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,400
I heard there was a terrorist attack in front of the Supreme Court.

201
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,140
You already know about this? As expected of Inspector Yun Su Hyeon of the MIU.  (MIU: Metropolitan Investigation Unit) 

202
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,080
You didn't get hurt, right? Don't tell me you acted recklessly again.

203
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,380
Stop it. Don't worry. I was so scared I hid far at the back. As a man should.

204
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,520
Good job. You've finally matured. Let's go upstairs now.

205
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,430
Go ahead. I'll finish with this one first.

206
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,410
Come on, stop this and come up.

207
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,670
- Why are you getting angry? 
 - Hurry, hurry, hurry.

208
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,800
Clink.

209
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,530
Won't you treat me to dinner?

210
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,210
- Why should I? 
 - I heard you'll be on TV.

211
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,230
But if you become a star like Kang Yo Han, it'll be difficult to see you in the future.

212
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,840
Being a star sounds nice.

213
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,690
Why are you being sarcastic?

214
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,250
Clink. Just drink your beer.

215
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,190
You've got nothing to lose being with a star like Kang Yo Han. He has a story.

216
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,550
The heir to an enormous wealth, and the survivor of a tragic accident...

217
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,010
People go crazy over these things.

218
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,220
True. His story is completely different from mine.

219
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,990
What's wrong with yours?

220
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,840
Hey, now that you've become a judge after all that hard work, you should move to a better neighborhood.

221
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,430
- What's wrong with this place? 
 - It's changed so much.

222
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,780
Compared to before.

223
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,150
This is the only place now.

224
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,720
For what?

225
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,740
To remember my parents.

226
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,230
- I'll make you food. Eat before you go. 
 - Food?

227
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,230
You've lost weight. You've been starving yourself again, I'm sure.

228
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,100
If you act this way, I might end up confessing to you again.

229
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,980
Even if I've been rejected five times since I was a kid, I figured it's not over until it's over.

230
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,380
- I don't want to loose my childhood friend. Have dinner before you go. You're done with this, right? 
 - Yes.

231
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,160
Heartless jerk.

232
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,300
I love you!

233
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,500
The key point is to deny that Chairman Ju Il Do knew anything about the details of the company's discharge.

234
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,370
We argue it was a  force majeure  event. 
( an event beyond anyone's control. )

235
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,940
If the people's vote goes toward the panel during the trial, what should our contractors do?

236
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,950
We'll have to emphasize that the sewage treatment facility was damaged because the hill's embankment collapsed.

237
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,300
That it was bound to happen due to the city's negligent management.

238
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,790
Chairman.

239
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,760
Attorney Go, hello.

240
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,170
Look at this. Isn't the public making too much noise?

241
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,000
Ungrateful things. 
    

242
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,370
Thousands of those dregs of society are able to scrounge for food today thanks to me.

243
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,930
Anyway in environmental accidents like this one there can never be indisputable evidence,

244
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,640
How can we expect the business owner to know about his factory's wastewater composition?

245
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,960
We'll plead innocent, and even in the worst case, you'll be charged with death and injury by occupational negligence.

246
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,020
Death and injury by occupational negligence...

247
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,000
What is the sentence for that?

248
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,010
- The maximum penalty is five years. 
 - Five years?

249
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,780
Well, they did make a special law and other things this time,

250
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,010
but the court is so conservative, they won't be able to increase the sentence like that so suddenly.

251
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,980
Don't you know that I can't sleep if my bed doesn't properly support my back?

252
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,470
Chairman. If you spend just one year reading and meditating,

253
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll get you out on parole.

254
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,520
You will even be coming out healthier.

255
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,790
You are sure of that, right?

256
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,220
If you are so anxious about this,

257
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,030
just remember that person is there.

258
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,010
You're right.

259
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,380
Chief.

260
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,560
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

261
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,870
- Don't mention it. 
 - You shot without hesitation.

262
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,070
Did I?

263
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,870
Were you thinking of killing the driver?

264
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,880
- If there was the need to. 
 - The need, you say?

265
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,310
It was likely the bus would have kept going straight ahead even if the driver had died instantly.

266
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,220
So you shot to make him turn the steering wheel instinctively.

267
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,450
So that he would be the only one to die if he crashed.

268
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,720
Isn't that basic arithmetic? One is a lesser number than two.

269
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,560
That's right.

270
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,290
 How was meeting Kang Yo Han? 

271
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,300
 I'm not sure.   
 I survived thanks to you.

272
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,670
You're welcome.

273
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,040
I guess I shouldn't become the lesser number when you are involved, Chief.

274
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,420
Don't do that, then.

275
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,680
 Why do you think Kang Yo Han chose Chairman Ju Il Do as his first defendant for the live court? 

276
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,240
 Isn't it because it's the case that's gaining the most attention from the public lately? 

277
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,050
 That's true. That's right. 

278
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,750
 But Chairman Ju Il Do is one of the largest donors of the Social Responsibility Foundation. 

279
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,110
 And Kang Yo Han's judicial reform 

280
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:29,550
 was possible because Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui and the Social Responsibility Foundation supported it. 

281
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:37,310
 So he should have avoided that case because it puts him in an awkward position, but instead he insisted on taking it?  

282
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,830
 I'm wondering if he might have an ulterior motive.  

283
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,850
Chief Kang. Regarding the preschool bus driver from yesterday,

284
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,650
what about indicting him without detention for now, and putting him through a trial later?

285
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,590
Why do you want to do so?

286
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,600
The live court is just around the corner.

287
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,190
Is there really a need to receive the public's attention over this shameful matter now?

288
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,020
There's the issue of what you did yesterday as well. First impressions are important, don't you think?

289
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,810
Are you asking me to show compassion toward a terrorist?

290
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,500
It's not about compassion, but about appearance.

291
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,090
In that case, there's nothing bad about it.

292
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,440
The noisier it gets, the more attention it'll garner. We're making noise marketing here.

293
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,290
For a case like this, imprisoning him is the fair thing to do.

294
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,760
Excuse me... May I say something?

295
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,140
The three-year-old daughter of that bus driver is one of the dead victims of the JU Chemical accident.

296
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,180
And her grandmother killed herself over the matter.

297
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,840
So?

298
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:52,030
I am a little concerned that rejecting Chairman Ju Il Do's arrest warrant while imprisoning the bus driver

299
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,990
might not be fair.

300
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,270
Judge Kim.

301
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,720
Ju Il Do is a defendant whose trial is to decide whether he is guilty or not, while the bus driver was caught in the act.

302
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
Don't you know that much?

303
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,390
But shouldn't we take motive into consideration—

304
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,620
Do you think you obtain the right to harm others if you're a victim yourself?

305
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,910
That's not what I mean, but he is injured and—

306
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,300
There is a doctor at the detention center too.

307
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,370
Let's go by the rules.

308
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:30,540
 Yu, the child who had been hospitalized following JU Chemical's waste water discharge accident, died. 

309
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,580
 In a tragic turn of events, the grandmother took her own life.   
    

310
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,410
 With this, the number of deaths due to this accident reaches eleven. 
   

311
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:43,210
 Including the ones undergoing treatment, the total number of victims is no less than forty-seven. 

312
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,950
 Investigation is underway to uncover the full story of the incident, 

313
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,190
 and Chairman Ju Il Do's trial will later— 

314
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,950
Sorry. It's a bit difficult to watch.

315
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,470
It reminds me of where I used to live. I'm a country girl, you see.

316
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,040
Even though I don't look like it.

317
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,370
And I'm from Seoul. As you can see.

318
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,120
From the slums, right?

319
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,650
- Is that obvious? 
 - Yes.

320
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,170
I guess people who came from poor backgrounds have a way of recognizing each other.

321
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,480
Like a kind of radar?

322
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,350
Then what do you see from Chief Kang?

323
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,440
Our chief Kang?

324
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,680
I'm not sure... 
  You can do it! Go for it, Oh Jin Ju!!! 

325
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,770
I don't see anything.

326
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,410
Fundamentals of your work life:

327
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,420
useless curiosity toward your superior is forbidden.

328
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,840
- Let's get to work. 
 - Yes.

329
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,320
We have the trial statute. Have a read through it.

330
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,020
- The trial statute? 
 - Yes.

331
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,810
The trial statute of our live court.

332
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,010
It might make you a bit angry.

333
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,180
You like to play with numbers very much, don't you?

334
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,390
When the viewers press the smartphone's app button, then let's judge after looking at the numbers.

335
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,750
Do you call it playing with numbers? I call it democracy.

336
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,370
If you're going to do such democratic trials, then why do you need us?

337
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,890
- I think you've read the trial statute. 
 - Is that a trial?

338
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,960
No matter how many opinions the associate judges give,  you'll make the final decisions based on the number of votes,

339
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
so why do you really need us?

340
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,190
It's necessary to have emergency measures during an emergency time.

341
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,330
And ... the pictures won't look good.

342
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,720
Pictures?

343
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,320
If there is nothing at my left and right sides, the pictures will feel empty. It's a broadcast after all.

344
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,050
 It's me. I need you to do something. 

345
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,610
- What is it? 
  -  Find me a spare key for the supreme court record storage room. 

346
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,690
You punk, do you think it's easy to get that?

347
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,630
If you can't even do such a small thing, I recommend you quit being a supreme court justice.

348
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,230
 Hello? 

349
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,800
Who dragged me here...?

350
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,820
You'll go to jail if you damage the records.

351
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,770
I won't tell about my accomplice, Supreme Court Justice.

352
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,320
I found it.

353
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,240
The actual case.

354
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,190
You punk chokes me up! So you searched for the 20-year-old records?

355
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,600
Isn't the love even for the first love the most ardent?

356
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,690
The first love?

357
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,550
When Chairman Ju Il Do expanded his business for the first time and got into trouble,

358
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,930
the person who let him off was an élite prosecutor from Seoul, Prosecutor Cha Gyeong Hui.

359
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,090
Whenever the incident was worth forgetting, she let him off the hook, and she did that three times - so he never got a citation.

360
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,530
Of course, she didn't do it for free, did she? 
    

361
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,030
When Cha Gyeong Hui ran for assemblywoman for the first time,

362
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,590
which chairman supported her?

363
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,720
Ju Il Do?

364
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,840
To summarize ...

365
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,790
Ju Il Do was the sponsor of Justice Minister Cha Gyeong Hui at the time when she was a prosecutor.

366
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,700
Cha Gyeong Hui has power and influence and has been supporting Kang Yo Han all this time.

367
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,700
Now Kang Yo Han insists on taking Ju Il Do's trial.

368
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,800
And Cha Gyeong Hui is just watching, without any objection to it.

369
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,560
Is this trial for revealing his crime?

370
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,520
Or the opposite?

371
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,720
The problem is that all these theories are just presumption.

372
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,610
I should dig into it, no matter what.

373
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,180
It seems I'm blocking my future with my own hands,

374
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,550
but it's too late to go back.

375
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,830
It is an ardent first love ...

376
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,700
Is Su Hyeon doing well?

377
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes, Ga On. It's okay. Tell me.

378
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,670
Wiretapping device? Why do you need it?

379
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,970
 Stay quiet! 

380
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,640
Hold on. I'll call you back.

381
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,260
Stop it!

382
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,650
Police!

383
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,260
Stay back!

384
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,100
Save me.

385
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,110
- She is my kid sister. 
 - Go to the wall.

386
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,960
I told you she is my kid sister.

387
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,400
Are you all right?

388
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,210
It's okay. It's okay.

389
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,280
I'm a policewoman.

390
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:01,660
Save me. 
   

391
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,830
 Minister, Director Jeong Seon Ah from the Social Responsibility Foundation (SRF) is here. 

392
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,540
- Let her in. 
  - Yes. 

393
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,260
Hello, Minister. I'm here on an errand from Mr. Seo.

394
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,800
What brings you here?

395
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,880
Excuse me. May I have a seat then tell you?

396
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,200
Thank you.

397
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,600
Both Mr. Seo as well as our foundation supporters

398
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,750
are worried a lot about this trial.

399
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,560
What are they worried about?

400
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,700
I'm sorry for saying it this way but let me be direct.

401
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,960
Let's catch these petty criminals so the citizens can release their anger.

402
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,830
Isn't that the reason we're holding this mock trial?

403
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,060
So?

404
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,100
So is it really necessary to put a businessman on trial?

405
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:28,300
If even a moderate sentence is the result, it would set a bad precedent for businessmen.

406
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,250
That's what they're worried about.

407
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,200
- Have you ever seen Kang Yo Han make a mistake? 
 - I haven't,

408
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,200
but they think it might be better if you choose an easier case for the first trial.

409
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,700
Why are you so adamant on this case?

410
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,360
Did you say I'm being adamant?

411
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,110
I'm sorry, I'm just the messenger.

412
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,080
Why are the people in the business of social welfare,

413
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,930
or rather, to be more exact, the alliance of the wealthy,

414
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,430
so invested in how the country is being run?

415
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,340
I'm pretty sure I said I would take care of it.

416
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,430
How arrogant.

417
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,320
I'm sorry, Minister Cha.

418
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,030
I've overstepped my boundaries.

419
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:43,520
May I dare say one more thing that is beyond my boundary?

420
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,200
Did you know that your chair and the desk you sit behind,

421
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,800
the painting on the wall, and even the car you commute with

422
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,640
were all paid for by our foundation.

423
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,210
That's because the ministry's budget came up short this year.

424
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,350
Right now, there aren't enough prisons, so we might have to build a private one ourselves.

425
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,550
I'm curious, Minister.

426
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,420
Who exactly

427
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,250
is serving this country?

428
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,030
What is it?

429
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,460
Why would a judge need a wiretapper?

430
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,580
Do you have a girlfriend who's cheating on you?

431
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,880
If that's easier for you to believe, then let's go with that.

432
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,490
- I can understand it, but I can't forgive it.
- Even if you can't, let's just go with that.

433
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,060
Quit joking around. What are you going to use it for?

434
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,340
You'll get hurt if you try to know too much.

435
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,060
It's not even one or two times you've been so obstinate.

436
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,500
- Let's test it. Go on the roof. 
 - The roof?

437
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,090
Wear this before you go.

438
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,190
What are looking at? Don't you know how to do it yourself? Just go.

439
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,940
No police brutality for citizens, Detective.

440
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,920
 Can you hear me, Judge Kim? 

441
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,990
 Will you marry me? No, I'm just joking. 

442
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,780
I love you.

443
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,970
She has a nice voice.

444
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,180
Did you hear it well?

445
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,880
- Very clearly. 
 - What's your answer?

446
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,610
Normally, you're not supposed to show that you heard.

447
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,460
So you're not going to answer?

448
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,580
Fine. Go catch your cheating girlfriend.

449
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,890
Hey, I just got called in. I'll call you later.

450
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,740
Again?

451
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,380
See you later.

452
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,240
Take care.

453
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,730
 Will you marry me? No, I'm just joking. 

454
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,500
 I love you. 

455
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
 Will you marry me? No, I'm just joking. 

456
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,330
 I love you. 

457
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,520
Hey.

458
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,440
Thank you.

459
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,050
Judge Kim?

460
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,850
Chief Judge, you're early.

461
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,080
The trial is right around the corner.

462
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,780
So what brought you here?

463
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,390
The library is closed.

464
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,750
Without turning the light on?

465
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,070
I have good night vision.

466
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,370
Then...

467
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,130
What?

468
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,770
- I heard you live alone. 
 - Yes.

469
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,320
It must be hard.

470
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,520
Your shirt is so wrinkled.

471
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,020
It's hard to find time to iron.

472
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,490
Right.

473
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,420
Keep up the good work.

474
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,730
He is an interesting guy.

475
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,910
 Dead: 11/ Injured:36 

476
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,840
 Associate Judge: Kim Ga On 

477
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,220
Yes, Minister of Justice.

478
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,900
 Judge Kang. Regarding the trial, 

479
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,270
I trust you, Judge Kang.

480
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:59,260
 Don't worry, Minister. Everything will be done according to the law. 

481
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,370
 I don't think the public is that stupid. 

482
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,790
It's me. Everything is ready, right?

483
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,030
 You met Doctor, right? So what did you say? 

484
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,290
 It turned out well. You worked hard. 

485
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,360
 I'll meet the attorney today. 

486
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,890
He's Ju Il Do's attorney.

487
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:18,690
 - What name is your reservation under? 
 - Kang Yo Han. 

488
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,390
Just before the trial, the judge met the defendant's attorney.

489
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:49,430
He spoke on the phone with the minister of justice who seems to be on his side.

490
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,530
And who is "Doctor"?

491
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:58,390
He's suspicious,  but we can't prove anything with this.

492
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:02,790
You know that, right? He could make an excuse that meeting his attorney was to discuss the procedure.

493
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:08,410
And all he said to the minister of justice was everything would be done according to the law.

494
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,460
The trial will be held just tomorrow.

495
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:20,770
I'm just going to watch him carefully with eyes wide open in court.

496
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:25,460
To bring facilities related to new technology such as electricity charging stations into the city,

497
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,200
we need to improve the building structures, use a classification system and share the information of architectural drawings.

498
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,540
We also need to reject the construction of high-rise buildings and promote Building Information Modeling

499
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,440
    
the building information modeling roadmaps.

500
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,920
By utilizing the construction information through these roadmaps—

501
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,500
Ah yes. Continue please.

502
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,790
I have something I absolutely have to watch today.

503
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:59,210
Shall we watch our Judge Kang Yo Han's skills?

504
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,680
 Father, please forgive them. 

505
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,620
 They know not what they're doing. 

506
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,830
Now 30 seconds left!

507
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,980
- When I say "three, two", get ready. 
 - Yes.

508
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,940
Now the sound check!

509
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,690
 It's very exciting in itself that the general public can participate in the trial. 

510
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:10,270
 And I think it's very nice that the public opinions come together as one. 

511
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,600
 If people commit a crime, getting punished for their crime is a natural course. 

512
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,200
 They would get voted on equally by the public, regardless of whether they're rich or not. 

513
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,870
 Now I think we're going to watch proper trials.  
 - I trust you.

514
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,640
 The first trial in the Live Court  show will open today.  
    

515
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:31,210
 Trust in the judiciary is very low, so can the Live Court Show change this current reality? 

516
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:36,280
 While the public is waiting for the first trial, full of hope  that everybody is equal before the law, 

517
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,910
 it's interesting to see whether Judge Kang Yo Han and his  Live Court Show will fulfill these expectations. 

518
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,110
Hello, everyone.

519
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,940
This is a live broadcast from the supreme court at this historical moment!

520
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,720
 The live court with public participation is waiting for you, for the first time in judicial history. 

521
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,920
 The method of participation is simple. 

522
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,230
 As you see, after you install the Goddess of Justice application, 

523
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:25,840
 - if you touch Goddess of justice, you can see the progressing trial.  
 - Mom!

524
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:33,480
- Yes, Gyu Min. Come here and stay quiet. 
 -  And you can see two buttons below. 

525
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,860
 While watching the trial, 

526
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:40,350
 if you think the defendant should get punished, 

527
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:46,120
 press the red button. But if you don't think so, then press the other one.  
    

528
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:52,230
 Your opinions will be collected, graphed, and brought to this court right away. 

529
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:59,500
 The court will judge, seeing the public's opinions in real time. 

530
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:07,100
I introduce the judge who presides at today's trial, Kang Yo Han!

531
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:20,700
Dear citizens! Now, the Live Court Show begins.

532
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,670
   

533
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:34,480
 There will no longer be a court held only among the élite, those who turn a blind eye to the public's common sense. 

534
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,260
 I'll open every step of trial to the public, make it transparent, and listen to your opinions. 

535
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,520
I'll render judgment according to the law, but I won't turn a blind eye to the people's will.

536
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,350
The owners of this court are you who are sovereign.

537
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,880
Ready, ready.

538
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,860
Let's meet together the case we are dealing with today.

539
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,790
Prosecutor, please explain it.

540
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,890
There is a village where all young people left.

541
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:44,600
The population of this village is 47 people. Their average age is 72 years.

542
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,810
Among them, 11 people died and 23 people are still in the intensive care units.

543
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:57,110
Thirteen people were discharged but are suffering breathing difficulties, neuropathy, and many severe side effects.

544
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:02,820
One of the dead was only 3 years old and another is her grandmother.

545
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,180
After she lost her precious granddaughter whom her daughter working in Seoul entrusted to her,

546
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,400
she strangled herself.

547
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,480
Her granddaughter was the only child in this village.

548
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,970
The culprit of this tragedy is sitting right there.

549
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:22,630
JU Chemicals Factory 4, that the defendant operates is only 5 kilometers away from this village.

550
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:28,820
From such a place, they released untreated toxic chemicals into the river.

551
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:33,840
The water that the village residents use for drinking, washing themselves and  their clothes, and for farming!

552
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,770
Ladies and Gentlemen!

553
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,040
This is a murder!

554
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:46,810
- What? Already?  Hey, broadcast! Broadcast! 
 - Yes.

555
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:53,280
   

556
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,870
I listened to the prosecutor's statement carefully.

557
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:08,990
Speaking exactly, it's not a statement but an inciting speech. I enjoyed hearing that.

558
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,600
Watch what you're saying!

559
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:15,600
We just saw the riskiness of the media court clearly.

560
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,050
A trial is not a movie. I's not a show either.

561
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:23,390
A trial is the process where something is proved only with objective evidence.

562
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,460
Just now, he said it's a murder.

563
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,180
What kind of crazy businessman would deliberately murder the residents?

564
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:34,810
As long as he released the toxic chemicals into the stream even though he knew it could kill people,

565
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:37,850
it's a murder by willful negligence.

566
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,070
Here, would you look at these?

567
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:48,420
As you see, the embankment collapsed at the hill behind the factory so the treatment facility got damaged.

568
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:54,280
Prosecutor, during my studies, I learned that the local government is responsible of managing the embankments.

569
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,410
I'm not sure if my memory is correct.

570
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,010
It's true that some toxic chemicals were discharged.

571
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:03,270
However, since we immediately stopped running the factory and did emergency repair,

572
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,160
the duration of toxic discharge was less than one hour.

573
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,110
Your Honor.

574
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:11,440
What could we do more than this?

575
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,830
This was beyond our control.

576
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:17,340
Hadn't there been discharge due to old equipment before that?

577
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,300
Do you have evidence?

578
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,710
Under the pretext of emergency repair, you replaced or scrapped all the problematic equipment.

579
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,590
Are you asking if I have evidence?

580
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,580
You mean you don't have evidence.  I understand.

581
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:33,760
The only proven fact is a discharge for a short time due to uncontrollable accident.

582
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,060
There is no evidence regarding the situation before that.

583
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,760
According to the forensic institute's presumption, a tragedy of that size couldn't happen because of a spill for only one hour—

584
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,670
Presumption? I think I heard wrong just now.

585
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,980
Is presumption an objective proof?

586
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,550
It's right!

587
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:57,110
Without any proof, how can you accuse this patriotic businessman of murder?

588
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:01,430
Do you know how many people can live in this economic crisis thanks to me?

589
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:05,130
Our JU Chemicals has as many as 17,400 employees.

590
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,350
If you add their families and affiliates,

591
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,750
it's over 100,000 people who depend on us for their livelihood.

592
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,320
- With this kind of public trial— 
 - Watch what you say, Defendant!

593
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,160
I also have a right to speak up!

594
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,700
Defendant!

595
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,170
Why doesn't he say anything? Why does he act like that?

596
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:32,030
Damn it. Broadcasting accident! Hey, get ready for advertisement!

597
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,960
- Defense Attorney, please return to your seat. 
 - Yes.

598
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,230
Wait! H-Hold on.

599
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,060
Defendant.

600
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,290
- Yes. 
 - Have a seat, please.

601
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,280
Y-yes.

602
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,830
Defense Attorney, have you finished your statement?

603
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,450
Yes, that's it.

604
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:41,320
Then, the court is adjourned for a moment and will continue later. You may go to the bathroom.

605
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,480
Judge, may I ask a question?

606
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,140
Go ahead.

607
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,600
The embankment collapse accident you mentioned earlier ---

608
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:17,600
The collapse happened the very night after the first death occurred.

609
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,000
Is it correct?

610
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,700
Yes, it's correct.

611
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,900
It seems it was quite a coincidence, doesn't it?

612
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,930
As soon as the death occurred,

613
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:29,580
how could such an accident happen and all evidence be gotten rid of?

614
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:33,570
I'm sorry, Judge, but the cause of the first death wasn't clear.

615
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,780
So it's our position that it had nothing to do with this incident.

616
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,900
According to the medical report, the victim showed  symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, convulsion, unconsciousness

617
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,070
that aren't different from the symptoms of other victims.

618
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:49,470
That was just an assumption. An autopsy wasn't even performed on the body.

619
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:53,950
There is no proof that the toxic chemicals were detected in him at all, Your Honor.

620
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,520
- Your Honor. 
 - Go ahead.

621
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,490
In order to hear an objective opinion, I would like to call the leading expert in heavy metal poisoning,

622
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:03,410
Dr. Yu Jung Baek, to the stand.

623
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,840
All right, go ahead.

624
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,250
 Everything's ready, right? Did you meet the doctor? 

625
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,770
First of all, thank you for making time in your busy schedule to come.

626
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:25,900
Not at all.

627
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:30,130
A sample of river water, ah, there it is.

628
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:34,800
Did you analyze it?  Did you form an opinion as an expert?

629
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,930
Some of the victims have signs of heavy metal poisoning.

630
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:43,630
There is a lot, but I'm somewhat concerned whether the reason was wastewater runoff.

631
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:46,510
Although it's easy to think of leaking from heavy metals

632
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:51,410
used  in a certain environment such as a factory, in reality, it's not so.

633
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,550
It exists in everyday life, wherever we live.

634
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,760
Food ingredients are raised on contaminated land.  Well ...

635
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,100
don't we always encounter chemicals in cosmetics?

636
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,150
Particularly, this region is the very first place

637
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,600
to be affected by fine dust containing heavy metals.

638
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,430
It's an agricultural area, so the impact of chemical herbicides and fertilizers is severe. 
 Guilty 53% Innocent 47%.

639
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:14,680
Compared to all that, the concentration of pollutants mixed into the river was very low.

640
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,570
I doubt it.

641
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:20,730
- Let me ask you a question. 
 - Yes.

642
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:24,860
- You just said "this low concentration of pollutants in the river."

643
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,430
What is the specific pollutant?

644
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,520
There was a mixture of chemicals.

645
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,440
Among them, which was the worst you detected?

646
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,700
That would be ... it's called potassium cyanide.

647
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,260
Can you make it easier for me to understand?

648
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,880
What is the common name for potassium cyanide?

649
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:49,350
Doctor?

650
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,410
Its name is cyanide.

651
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:57,800
Cyanide!

652
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,600
Seven, seven, seven. 
 Even though JU Chemical Chairman Ju Il Do knew of the discharge of cyanide, he did nothing. 

653
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,210
The word may sound frightening but

654
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,610
isn't the chemical cyanide very common in nature?

655
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:10,520
Yes, I know. It's very common.

656
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:15,600
It's in almonds, apple seeds, apricot kernels, cherry pits,  and gingko nuts. It's also in peach stones.

657
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,800
It's not unconditionally dangerous.  It's the concentration.

658
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,370
The concentration is the problem.

659
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:25,680
There was a village in the immediate vicinity where most of the residents were elderly.

660
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,350
Even so, wouldn't the concentration detected really be zero?

661
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,660
- I am sorry but, your honors— 
 - Umm. Your Honor.

662
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,310
Although Your Honor knows the law,

663
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,080
don't you think I know this field even better?

664
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,940
Science is facts.  I'm saying it's not a matter of people's sentiment.

665
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,780
- Witness. 
 - Judge Kim.

666
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,330
That's enough.  Stop.

667
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,420
Thank you, Doctor.

668
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,820
- Yes.  
 - You may step down.

669
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,590
It must have been difficult to testify for so long. Please have a drink of water.

670
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:02,910
- Chief Judge. 
 - Give the witness some water.

671
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,830
Thank you.

672
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,530
Wait a minute.  That water.  Did you change the water from the sample earlier?

673
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,340
What did you do? Seriously.

674
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:29,600
Your Honor.  It's not so. The evidence is kept here.

675
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,760
They look pretty similar to me too.  I didn't realize and made a mistake.

676
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,290
I'm sorry, Doctor.

677
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:41,650
He said the water was all right

678
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,340
I'm embarrassed.

679
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,120
If you're done, you may leave, Doctor.

680
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,740
I didn't expect he would do that.

681
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,640
How humiliating.

682
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,690
It's all because of that damned chairman. Really.

683
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,560
What's the matter?

684
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:24,350
Your Honors, I will proceed with the interrogation of the next witness,

685
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:27,660
Jang Gi Hyeon, field manager of the wastewater purification facility.

686
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,320
Witness, you've worked at the wastewater purification facility for twelve years.

687
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,950
Prior to the embankment collapse, was there ever any problem there?

688
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:40,670
 January 16th statement. "As far as I know, in the time I continuously managed plant 4 there was never any problem." 

689
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,900
Witness? Didn't you already state that to the investigating agency?

690
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,680
Why aren't you answering my question?

691
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,950
Well, that is,

692
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,520
I have a lot on my mind.

693
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,440
- Witness— 
 - Manager Jeong!

694
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,750
- Defendant. 
 - Yes.

695
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,700
Please remain seated. Now.

696
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,530
I'm sorry.

697
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:08,650
- Please continue. 
  - Yes, Your Honor.

698
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,820
Actually, there's something I want to tell you.

699
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:17,200
- What is it— 
 - The wastewater has been leaking for some time now.

700
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,460
I still don't understand why the embankment which was intact for 30 years

701
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,460
suddenly collapsed that night,

702
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:27,530
but I what I am certain of the fact that wastewater was already leaking before.

703
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:31,530
It was such an important matter that I reported it to the chairman.

704
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:34,040
- Manager! 
 - Defendant.

705
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,730
Please return to you seat.

706
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:43,600
Witness, please speak comfortably.

707
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,750
The facility's deterioration due to age is serious.

708
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,920
I told the chairman we would have a  major problem if we didn't do something immediately.

709
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,910
But the chairman replied "Why are you making a fuss when we are moving to Southeast Asia next year?"

710
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,100
- "Why are you making a mountain out of a molehill?" 
 - Manager Jeong!

711
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,890
Yes, what did you say when you heard him say that?

712
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:05,460
What if something happens to the elderly living in the village?

713
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,190
- If that happens— 
 - If that happens—

714
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,090
The chairman said,

715
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:15,910
"what does it matter for old people who have lived long enough?"

716
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,360
Manager Jeong, when did I ever say that?

717
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:23,250
What do you think about  "lived long enough"?

718
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,330
Don't tell me that's what you said.

719
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,590
At the time, I thought,

720
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:36,390
Isn't that murder?   Is he living disguised as a human being?

721
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,410
No.  I really didn't. Your Honor.

722
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:42,190
I never said that.

723
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:44,360
That's murder.

724
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:49,220
My nickname is "Doctor Safety."

725
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:54,010
I've worked my whole life taking care of everything according to the safety manuals without a problem,

726
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,540
so I really want to die, Your Honor.

727
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,850
 You were prepared, weren't you? You met the doctor. 

728
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,890
 I'd like to call Dr. Yu Jung Baek as a witness. 

729
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,700
 My nickname is Doctor Safety. 

730
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,990
 Guilty 86% Innocent 14% 

731
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,360
- Damn! 
 - Wow!

732
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,490
Look at that S.O.B.  Complete garbage. Don't you agree?

733
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,670
There's nothing more to watch. Sentence him to death.

734
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,330
He's got a lot of nerve.

735
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,760
- Let him off! 
 - Death penalty. Death penalty. Death Penalty.

736
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,470
 Guilty 89% 

737
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,840
Your Honor, that's not fair!

738
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,650
It's really, really, not. I never said anything like that.

739
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:38,190
Why would I say something like "those old people lived long enough"?

740
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,600
- You never said anything like that?  Then what did you say? 
 - What?

741
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,060
You don't deny meeting the witness.

742
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,940
What did you say when you met the plant manager?

743
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,530
That is ...

744
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:56,880
Defendant. Please answer.

745
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,770
The whole country is watching.  
   Guilty 91% 

746
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:05,590
Because I ... I had a lot of work to do,

747
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:09,550
I can't remember the conversation, Your Honor.

748
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,390
 No. Really, no. Your Honor. 

749
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,690
 I never said that. 

750
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,300
 No. No. 

751
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,570
- Are you treating the public like fools now? 
 - That's not so.

752
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:25,190
What does "What does it matter to people who have lived long enough" mean exactly, Defendant?

753
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,370
No.

754
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,710
I'm blinded by my own money.  I don't care if everyone else dies.

755
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:33,150
Do you know that is willful negligent homicide?

756
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,720
Chairman.

757
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,210
 Occupational Negligence 

758
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,720
 I'm going to urge innocence, but if anything should go wrong, 

759
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,730
 then I will argue for death and injury by occupational negligence. 

760
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:47,950
Do you understand, Defendant?

761
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,740
 Guilty 95% 
 Occupational negligence negligence. 

762
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,160
 Guilty 96% Innocent 4% 

763
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:01,800
I am sorry.

764
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:06,420
It's true I received a briefing.

765
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,230
Do you admit you received a report of the leak?

766
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:11,510
And that you didn't care if people in the vicinity died?

767
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,990
- That's not true. 
 - If it is.

768
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:18,150
What is this? That bastard Kang Yo Han! What the hell is he doing?

769
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:22,050
Please calm down, Minister. Judge Kang must be thinking of something.

770
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,070
What is he thinking?

771
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:28,520
I didn't think anything would happen.

772
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,850
At the time the leak wasn't that big.

773
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:34,400
I really didn't think it would result in this.

774
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,060
What do you mean, "murder"?  That's truly ridiculous.

775
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:45,220
Then, the defendant denies involuntary manslaughter.

776
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:49,290
Do you admit negligence in your work?

777
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:53,020
 Ju Il Do was the sponsor of Justice Minister Cha Gyeong Hui. 

778
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:57,790
 She has power and influence and has been supporting Kang Yo Han all this time. 

779
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:01,540
 Everything's ready, right?  Did you meet the doctor? 

780
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:05,270
-  Meet the lawyer today.   
 - I am sorry.

781
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,300
It's my fault.  I was stupid.

782
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,250
I did it out of foolishness.

783
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:20,540
Anyway, you were moving to the new factory soon, weren't you?

784
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,650
I committed a crime deserving of death.

785
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,760
 Don't worry, Minister. It will be done according to the law. 

786
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,730
 I don't think the public is that stupid. 

787
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:35,130
 I only trust Kang Yo Han. 

788
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,180
You're pushing him into death and injury by occupational negligence?

789
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,460
Chief Judge.

790
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:44,910
If you plead guilty to murder with one or two lies from a witness,

791
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:47,420
this trial is a farce.

792
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:51,660
I ask you to make a decision based solely on the rule of law.

793
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:55,460
I'll bear what you say in mind.

794
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,640
I'll announce my ruling after a short break.

795
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,060
You said five years for occupational negligence?

796
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,700
Don't worry.  Parole isn't up to the judge.  It's up to the Ministry of Justice.

797
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:27,370
How dare he say murder?

798
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:31,280
Why the heck did Jeong Gi Hyeon lie like that?

799
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,140
Judge! It's a big hit! Big!

800
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:43,860
It had 11.4% average viewing rate and reached the highest 14.7% viewing rate per minute.

801
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:49,680
Moreover the most important viewing rate for the age between 20 and 49 is over 6%, Judge!

802
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,700
- We're a great success, right? 
 - Of course yes.

803
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,880
Is a trial an entertainment?

804
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:00,200
That's not what I meant but I just meant the citizens are very interested in the trial, Judge.

805
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:07,920
- He's always a little edgy. Please take good care of us. 
 - Yes.

806
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:15,500
How much money did we put into this to secure the exclusive right to broadcast?

807
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:20,470
Our chairman will grin from ear to ear.

808
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:23,430
Even though you're happy, you shouldn't show it too obviously.

809
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,310
I got it. Have some steak.

810
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:27,940
Bye.

811
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,130
Treat us to a meal.

812
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:34,350
I'll buy all the meals in the world.

813
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,150
You gained a lot of money.

814
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,000
Cheers.

815
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:45,860
   

816
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:50,490
I'm going to make a ruling.

817
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:55,570
 I'm seriously accepting the opinion of the citizens who watched this trial. 

818
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:59,160
I contemplated a lot but with the state of the evidence which was admitted

819
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:04,320
I concluded that it's unreasonable to decide he murdered willfully.

820
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,270
However, the defendant admitted to the indictment charges of death and injury by occupational negligence,

821
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:15,220
for which I pronounce him guilty.

822
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:19,770
The maximum penalty for death and injury by occupational negligence is five years.

823
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:33,470
However, among the judiciary reform bills passed last year,

824
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:39,570
there is an article which provides that the sentence shall be within the total derived from adding the  punishment for each victim.

825
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,390
No way...

826
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,720
- Kim Sun Ja, Park Myeong Sun, 
 -  Who are they? 

827
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,090
Lee Jeong Ro,

828
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:20,290
Bae Myeong Jae,

829
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,690
And child Yu So Yeong.

Lee Gab Geun,

831
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:34,020
Kim Dong Jae,

832
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,430

Kim Yu Chun,

01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,560
Jeong Gwuin Ah,

838
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,990
Hwang Mal Ja,

839
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,270
Seon Wu Yun Jeong,

840
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:00,300
Yun Yeong Suk,

841
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,830
- He is really a pro. 
 -  Lee Seok Gyu, 

842
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,460
Won Yeong Seon.

843
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,600
   

844
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:35,270
To the defendant who took away the innocent's lives because of his foolish greed

845
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:40,260
and made the survivors suffer the rest of their lives,

846
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:46,460
within total of adding the punishments for 47 victims, imprisonment!

847
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,590
I sentence 235 years' imprisonment!

848
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:57,740
 Imprisonment of 235 years 

849
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,670
 Guilt: 97%, Innocence: 3% 

850
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,740
Hey, stop the car.

851
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,040
 Imprisonment of 235 years  
  Guilt: 97%, Innocence: 3% 

852
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,260
Is this possible right now?

Live a long life, please.

855
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:29,330
Attorney Go, you said five years.

856
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:31,100
Five years.

857
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:46,340
  Live Court Show 

858
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:57,800
Judge! Judge, thank you.

859
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,500
Judge, thank you. Judge, thank you.

860
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:08,510
Thank you, Judge. Thank you, Judge.

861
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:11,850
Thank you, Judge.

862
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:16,100
Thank you.

863
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,250
I won't have any regrets even if I die now.

864
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:27,780
Kim Sun Ja who strangled herself after she lost her precious granddaughter is my sister.

865
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:31,030
I tried to die to follow her a few times.

866
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:36,390
Since my life string was so durable, I couldn't make it as I wanted.

867
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,440
 You deny murder with willful negligence 

868
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,880
 but you admit  occupational negligence.  

869
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:12,280
 If you put each person's picture on the screen, I'll call each person's name. 

870
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,810
 Yes, I understand. 

871
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:28,470
 Bae Myeong Jae, Lee Seok Gyu, and Child Yu So Yeong.

 Timing and Subtitles by the Devil's Minions @ viki 

874
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:17,130
 It was touching. My eyes teared up a little bit. 

875
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,700
 The rule of law? Is justice the goal of a trial? 

876
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:22,180
 That you act as if you're warm-hearted although you're stony-hearted. 

877
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:24,990
 It's to sell hope and get it repaid with terror. 

878
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,410
 What do you want? 

879
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:27,540
 A prey? 

880
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:30,260
 Someone who only pleases himself has no charm. 

881
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,170
 nor any usefulness. 

882
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:33,740
 Why do you do such things? 

883
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,320
 You're just a bait. A fresh one. 

884
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,100
 I think he hasn't been tamed enough. 

885
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,750
 You crazy bastard!
