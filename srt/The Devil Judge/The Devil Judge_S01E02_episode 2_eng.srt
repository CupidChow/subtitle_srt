00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,050
 Ji Sung 

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,400
 Kim Min Jung 

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,390
 Jin Young 

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,690
 Park Gyu Young 

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,380
 NO JUSTICE 

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,340
 The Devil Judge 

7
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,160
 This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea.  All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional. 

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,870


9
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,520
Judge Kim. What are you doing?

10
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,580
Thank you for your hard work, Judge Kim. 
  Episode 2 

11
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,620
Thank you for your hard work.

12
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,690
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - I did not do much. Thank you for your hard work.

13
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,570
Since you've been working hard, shall we have dinner together?

14
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,570
I like it.

15
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,920
Say yes.

16
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,890
If you don't want it, then never mind.

17
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,920
I do.

18
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,730
What a relief!

19
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,390
I was so nervous that I almost died wanting to pee.

20
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,570
Judge Kim, were you all right?

21
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,130
As there are lights all around me and the camera aimed at me looked as if  it was fiercely staring at me,

22
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,650
I felt as if I was stripped naked, standing on the street.

23
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,190
Judge Oh.

24
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,790
Can people yawn while tears are running?

25
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm not sure.

26
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,830
I think tears run whenever I yawn.

27
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,990
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

28
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,350
It's nothing.

29
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,390
By the way, didn't you feel thrilled?

30
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,020
The feeling that all citizens were looking at me.

31
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,540
Of course, they were looking at our chief judge, not me.

32
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,660
Not me.

33
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,390
Judge Oh?

34
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,640
I'm saying I'm so relieved that it was not me.

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,300
If it had been me, I would have 100% caused trouble, nervous as I was.

36
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,110
By the way, aren't you excited? He said he would treat us dinner.

37
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,230
- Excited? 
 - Yes.

38
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,460
I heard our chief is a heir to a very wealthy family.

39
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,470
Then he must be a great epicure.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,750
Chief, what is your hobby?

41
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,500
Golf or tennis?

42
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,340
- Hunting. 
 - Hunting?

43
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,120
Hunting ... the one where you shoot with a gun and catch a hare?

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,230
No, no. That is boring. My fun is to hunt a strong one.

45
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,630
It looks good.

46
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,470
What kind of meat is this?

47
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,570
It's a wild boar. A very big one.

48
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,060
- Wild... 
 - I have a hunting license for harmful wild animals.

49
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,160
Amazing.

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,410
It's really thrilling.

51
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,210
Shooting  between its eyes when it rushes at you, canines out.

52
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,300
- Does it taste good? 
 - Pardon?

53
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,160
- This. 
 - It's a new taste with a deep flavor.

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,940
I'm jealous of you. I can't taste well.

55
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,430
To me, food is... how should I call it?

56
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,270
A chewing sensation?

57
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,300
"A chewing sensation"?

58
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,340
Biting with my incisors, gnawing with my molars,

59
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,280
and shredding with my fangs. That sort of sensation.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,940
Should I say it's like feeling the food with my teeth?

61
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,600
That word is normally used for the teeth of animals.

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,440
- Aren't humans animals? 
 - We normally say "tooth" for people.

63
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,200
It's the same either way.

64
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,210
But what do you mean, you "can't taste well"?

65
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,150
Don't you mean that you've become numb to taste because of all the good food you've had since you were young?

66
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,490
Since I was young, you say?

67
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,570
You were the young master of a wealthy family since birth, after all.

68
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,000
"Since birth"...

69
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,200
I said something I shouldn't have, didn't I?

70
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,900
No, you didn't. You are right, I come from a wealthy family.

71
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,750
But do you know this?

72
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,480
My late father...

73
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,630
he was a loan shark.

74
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,950
A second-generation loan shark. Extremely vicious.

75
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,230
- A cold-blooded man? 
 - Judge Kim.

76
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,160
You know well what makes a private-loan business owner.

77
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,660
Did you maybe grow up in a debt-ridden family, Judge Kim?

78
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,440
Do you run background checks on your associate judges?

79
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,800
We need to know about each other since we work in the same court.

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,020
Your father was swindled out of his entire wealth and committed suicide, right?

81
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,070
Oh my, I am sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

82
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,640
The essence of a loan shark is to pretend being warm-hearted when actually being cold-blooded. Isn't it?

83
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,730
Judge Kim. Chief didn't do it on purpose—

84
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,870
You do know well.

85
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,440
It's to sell hope and get it repaid with terror.

86
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,640
My father used to go to confession very regularly.

87
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,060
Every time a debtor committed suicide.

88
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,780
 I confess my wrongdoings to Jehovah.  

89
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,890
 I have told the Lord of my sin and have not hidden it, 

90
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,950
 thus may the Lord forgive me of my sins.  

91
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,930
What is it? You can't see yourself growing up under someone like that?

92
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,960
- I will take my leave. 
 - Judge Kim.

93
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,410
I really don't feel well.

94
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,180
I have quite a weak stomach, you see.

95
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,730
- What are you doing? 
 -  I'm on a safari.  

96
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,430
Again?  Come on man, hurry up.  

97
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,650
-  I've set everything up.   
 - I'll have fun for a little longer.

98
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,900
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

99
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,810
What is he doing?

100
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,550
What is this?

101
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,120
Useless beggars.

102
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,400
How could you?

103
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,860
Damn it.

104
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,000
Are you all right?

105
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,180
I apologize.

106
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,900
You should be more careful.

107
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,890
 Combining the sentences related to each of the forty-seven victims,  

108
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,480
 I sentence you to 235 years of imprisonment.  

109
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,220
The trial is not a joke! 235 years?

110
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,830
Is this your doing, Mr. President?

111
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,110
Kang Yo Han, that guy teared up while calling those old people's names—

112
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,410
Ah, that. That is difficult.

113
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,720
I did it a lot when I was an actor, so I know.

114
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,190
It is really difficult to make yourself tear up at the right timing.

115
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:45,580
How did Judge Kang cry without eye drops— Did he perhaps use something like a tear stick?

116
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,890
I could act any scene back in those days, but could not tear up well.

117
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,930
I guess that was the reason I couldn't be a main lead.

118
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,470
Aren't you doing that as much as you want right now? Being the main lead?

119
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,630
I am not sure. Am I the main lead?

120
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,730
There are too many intense characters lined up beside me.

121
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,050
As for me, truthfully, I don't know my position clearly yet.

122
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,900
You should know it well. Isn't it obvious that you are the main lead?

123
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,650
You are the head of this country that is in a dire state.

124
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,220
But Minister Cha, you sustained heavy damage  losing Chairman Ju, didn't you?

125
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,900
I mean, you who put so many chaebols* behind the bars,
  (members of family-owned business conglomerates) 

126
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,620
got too disturbed when things went downhill for Chairman Ju. That seemed a bit weird to me.

127
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,650
It made me think something is there...

128
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,700
I just shot a arrow in the dark. It is just my imagination.

129
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,660
You know I have a rich imagination, right?

130
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,190
I used to be an actor, an artist.

131
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,260
However, wasn't the first trial orchestrated by you?

132
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,990
Right?

133
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,880
Even the foundation must not like it.

134
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,340
Losing one of the largest sponsors—

135
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,710
No, it did not look as if Master Seo disliked it.

136
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,030
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

137
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,300
Minister Cha.

138
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,580
Master Seo is here, right?

139
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,860
He is meditating. You shouldn't have come this suddenly, without even an appointment.

140
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,330
Move. How dare a mere secretary act this way?

141
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,950
You shouldn't do this, Minister Cha.

142
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,050
I "shouldn't"? Aren't you people a little too puffed up right now?

143
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,120
Does he think he's some sort of doyen of the nation, just because the president treats him with deference?

144
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,260
I understand.

145
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,150
Let's talk.

146
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,980
Did you not hear me?

147
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,960
- Are you displeased because things are not going your way? 
 - What did you say?

148
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,360
Why did you come here

149
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,200
and act so rudely out of the blue?

150
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,530
Who is to talk?

151
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,890
Who's the one who ruined everything?

152
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,750
You dared scheme with Kang Yo Han without me knowing and stab me in the back?

153
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,890
- What are you talking about? 
 - Of course, pretend not to know.

154
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,230
I am sure Judge Kang has his own view of things.

155
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,490
Enthralling the masses using a big case won't do us any harm in the long run.

156
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,290
Are you saying that Heo Jung Se sweet-talked Kang Yo Han to do that on his own?

157
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,390
- Do not make hasty conclusions. 
 - Think carefully.

158
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,280
Will screwing me over and joining hands with Heo Jung Se benefit you?

159
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,190
I won't stay put either.

160
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,200
If you're finished talking, you can go.

161
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,590
Vicious old geezer.

162
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,130
Is the outcome of this trial necessarily detrimental?

163
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,780
What's that?

164
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,850
Seventeen percent. The results of a poll just came out.

165
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,030
Approval ratings for the ruling party are up by 17 %.

166
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,330
It'll be you, Minister. The ruling party's next presidential candidate.

167
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,560
And I'm sure there are many big businesses which want to finance the next president.

168
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,620
Even way more generous than JU Chemical.

169
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,590
What are you saying?

170
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,450
Oh, I'm sorry. I was presumptuous.

171
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,920
A mere secretary.

172
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,410
Professor. How many times are you sending me to fetch the ball?

173
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,300
Sorry.

174
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,280
Are you all right?

175
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,850
Yes!

176
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,520
Wow, I'm totally flabbergasted.

177
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,470
How could you cheat your student? The country's supreme court justice?

178
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,790
A 'fake'* is not a scam. 
 (*a move in basketball) 

179
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,620
I'm not sure about anything.

180
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,350
I thought this trial was to let off the defendant but it turned out to be the opposite.

181
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,990
It's harder to figure out what they are up to.

182
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,260
The president's approval ratings have gone up.

183
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,260
There must be a deal we don't know about.

184
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,720
Even so, I also think the outcome was good.

185
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,860
It went well?  That's what trials are about.

186
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,600
Is it enough for you to like the outcome?

187
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,490
No.  You shouldn't treat a trial like a joke.

188
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,960
I will look more into what is going on.

189
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,260
I'm sorry, Judge Kim.

190
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,700
I don't really mind much, but ...

191
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,920
"Judge Kim."

192
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,420
That gives me goosebumps.

193
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,530
It used to be "Hey, you loser! Do you want to die at my hands?!"

194
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,860
Those were my words to Kim Ga On, the juvenile delinquent.

195
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,070
You mean the words of a gangster professor?

196
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,030
What more did you say? "The soil smells great. Do you want to be buried in it?"

197
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,320
How could you say that to a pitiful kid?

198
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you slandering Supreme Court justice with false facts?

199
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,320
 The preparations are all done right? You have met with the doctor? 

200
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,960
 My nickname is 'safety doctor' 

201
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,360
What if this doctor was not Yu Jong Baek but Jang Gi Hyeon?

202
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,970
Yes?

203
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,330
You have worked hard.

204
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,940
Oh, Judge Kim.

205
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,090
I came to return this book.

206
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,430
You came in daytime today.

207
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,790
I have something that is bothering me.

208
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,330
Is that so? That's not right.

209
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,690
You are the precious sidekick who sits to my left.

210
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,530
- What did you just say? 
 - Sit and talk.

211
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,670
What is bothering you?

212
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,600
It's about Witness Jang Gi Hyeon in this trial.

213
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,200
- Yes, that 'Doctor Safety'?
 - Yes.

214
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,860
- What about him?
 - Was he trustworthy?

215
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,090
What are you talking about?

216
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,330
I've never seen before a witness who voluntarily contradicted his prior statement.

217
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,500
- Maybe his conscience stung him.
 - His conscience?

218
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,670
Why? You don't believe people have a thing called conscience?

219
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,600
I am not sure. I was not touched, as I could see his intention.

220
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,500
Intention?

221
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,700
Didn't he make it seem as if the defendant intentionally murdered the victims?

222
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,240
- And you went along with that very openly. 
 - ' Very openly'?

223
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,060
You were mostly calm throughout the trial. Your reaction was the most animated at that point.

224
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,200
 What if something bad happens to the elderly in the village? 

225
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,640
 - I said that to the Chairman—
 - And then? 

226
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,870
 The chairman said, "what does it matter for old people who have lived long enough?" 

227
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,650
 Don't tell me that's what you said. 

228
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,570
 At the time, I thought, Isn't that murder? 

229
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,890
 Murder you say... 

230
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,330
It seems you were only watching me, Judge Kim.

231
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,390
- That's not true. 
 - Did we acknowledge that he killed people intentionally?

232
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,130
- No, we did not, but—
 - Then what is the issue?

233
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,710
Because of that testimony, the defendant changed his statement and admitted the death and injury by occupational negligence.

234
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,280
Then, isn't that a good thing?

235
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,180
- Is the outcome all that matters?
 - The process has to be fair too?

236
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,210
Of course, because that is the rule of law and this is a trial!

237
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,850
Rule of law? Judge Kim, do you think the goal of a trial is justice?

238
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,890
What is it, if not justice?

239
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,010
A trial is a game, where if you cannot prove things, you lose.

240
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,320
But it is not a fair game to begin with.

241
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,200
The rich and powerful do whatever they can to manipulate and cover up the truth,  and bribe investigative agencies.

242
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,400
On the other side, there's just a huge crowd of angry, whining people.

243
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,380
 How can you frame a patriotic businessman as a murderer without any proof? 

244
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,670
 Do you know how many people are making their living thanks to me in this economic crisis? 

245
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,170
Sadly, there is no such thing as justice.

246
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,970
It's just a game. Vicious and unfair.

247
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,480
He resembles him.

248
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,430
He resembles him so much.

249
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,240
Yes, Ga On.

250
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,500
No, it's okay.  Tell me.

251
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,160
Oh, you want to meet me?

252
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,500
I'm kind of busy.

253
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,560
No, it's not that much. I'll try to make some time.

254
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,240
Yes.

255
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,740
It looks like you're going on a date.

256
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,740
Please be quiet.

257
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,280
Yes.

258
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,680
 You met Doctor, right?  

259
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,270
 You worked hard. I'll meet the attorney today. 

260
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,260
- You wanted to meet me to tell me this. 
 - Yes.

261
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,000
- Are you going to go on a stakeout? 
 - Yes.

262
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,150
I'm going to go to catch a very bad guy. Why are you asking?

263
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,970
It goes well with you.

264
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,840
What wouldn't go well with me?

265
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,220
Anyway, so your lover cheating on you, whom you mentioned before, was your chief, right?

266
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,590
What a taste you have...

267
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,830
- You're putting it like that now? 
 - It's the excuse you came up with.

268
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,040
Listening to an ajeossi's phone conversation. Sheesh!

269
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,980
I already explained that I had sufficient reason to doubt him.

270
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,210
Anyway, did you really not find the plant manager, who came to testify, strange?

271
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,110
You also interrogate a lot of suspects right? When do they confess their secrets all of a sudden?

272
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,920
 I really want to die,  Your Honor. 

273
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,420
Well, sometimes people are plagued by their conscience—

274
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,720
Just a minute, don't give me that nonsense, Detective.

275
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,810
They probably do it to save their backs. Why are you asking when you already know that?

276
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,340
If the doctor in his phone call were that witness,

277
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,170
Are you saying that your chief fabricated testimony?

278
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,720
I am not sure. It's possible if it's him.

279
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,450
Hey, he is the hero of the people right now. He is the nation's judge.

280
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,250
Don't go around saying that. You may get stabbed.

281
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,690
These roadblocks!

282
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,120
 Share love and hope together. 

283
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,820
Thank you.

284
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,550
Your little help can become a great strength to someone.

285
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,120
You keep doing what Ji Eun doesn't want. Of course she fights with you.

286
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,930
How many times is this now?

287
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,070
Mom!

288
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,030
You should be driving carefully.

289
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,840
You jerk! Aren't you going to drive carefully?

290
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,010
Are you all right?

291
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,420
I have seen that car before.

292
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,770
Why drive and become a roadblock?!

293
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,740
This bastard!

294
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,550
Hey! You crazy bastard!

295
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,650
Nice!

296
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,210
Be careful!

297
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,930
A little faster.

298
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,330
- I think we are going to lose him. 
 - How are we going to catch him with this car?

299
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,500
What is that ahead?

300
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,960
What is this?

301
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,690
What is it?

302
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,360
This crazy bastard.

303
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:52,560
♫  You say I will be in the moonlight  ♫

304
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:02,370
♫  In the moonlight, in the moonlight  ♫

305
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,280
This crazy bastard.

306
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,730
Hey you crazy bastard, get lost!

307
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,690
♫  Born in a warped place  ♫

308
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,650
♫  I came here  ♫

309
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,570
♫  That's when I met you  ♫

310
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,470
Hey you crazy bastard! Can't you wait to die?!

311
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,280
There he is. Stop here.

312
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,870
Do you want to die, I asked?!

313
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,370
What is that?

314
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,130
Hey!

315
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,910
Hey, what sort of a bastard are you?!

316
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:59,240
-  Hey!  
 - He is that person right? Kang Yo Han?

317
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,760
Aren't you psychotic or something?

318
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,740
What are you doing right now?

319
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,550
What are you doing right now? Hey!

320
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,200
Let that go. Don't come close to me.

321
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,430
I said don't come!

322
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,140
Let that go! Don't come!

323
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,760
This crazy guy! Who is this bastard?!

324
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,200
Hey!

325
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,870
Hey!

326
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,610
♫  Something stronger  ♫

327
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,710
♫  I want to find some love  ♫

328
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,390
♫  Something stronger  ♫

329
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,490
♫  Well abiding  ♫

330
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,200
You are that judge from TV, aren't you?

331
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,950
Why-Why are you doing this to me?

332
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,240
Because you were being a roadblock.

333
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,200
What?!

334
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,160
This bastard.

335
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,010
How dare a judge do this to me? Do you know who I am?!

336
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,770
I won't leave you alone!

337
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,690
You just wait.

338
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,180
Hey that...

339
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,300
This is not mine. Where did this come from? This is not mine.

340
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,960
The important thing is that I discovered this in your car.

341
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,740
There is your fingerprint on it. I'm confiscating this.

342
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:53,140
Also, if you can't drive a car, use the subway.

343
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,040
What is that?

344
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,960
Hey!

345
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,380
Hey, you!

346
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,180
Hey!

347
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,330
Damn it!

348
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,320
What did I just see?

349
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,430
Do you believe me now?

350
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,360
Hello.

351
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,700
Have you been up the whole night?

352
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,500
Yes. I should work hard to compensate for my lack of skills.

353
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,360
- Why do you say that? 
 - I am aware, you know.

354
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,350
I know I was hired for my looks.

355
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,040
But still, people have high expectations for us.

356
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,790
I really want to do well.

357
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,300
 Hello?  

358
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,400
Hi. I'm on my way to the witness's house. Manager Jang Gi Hyeon.

359
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,480
Why?

360
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,070
 Why? I'll get the details of the testimony to see if there's anything strange.  

361
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,250
It's not your problem, I'll take care of it.

362
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,990
You're treating me like a stranger again.

363
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,790
 I am Yun Su Hyeon, the ace of the MIU.  

364
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,770
I don't turn a blind eye when a judge cheats.

365
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,430
He's messed with the wrong person, that Kang Yo Han.

366
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,260
Good morning.

367
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,300
Who are you?

368
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,900
I am from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.  I am Inspector Yun Su Hyeon.

369
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,200
Did you come here to find me a job, now that I've been fired for whistleblowing?

370
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,460
- Pardon? 
 - If not, you can leave.

371
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,300
This darn conscience of mine could cause my family to starve.

372
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,490
Wait, Mister Jang Gi Hyeon!

373
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,720
She has come to visit Jang Gi Hyeon, as you expected.

374
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:34,630
 Kim Ga On came to tell me he was suspicious of Jang Gi Hyeon.  

375
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,220
It's not surprising, after all.

376
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:43,100
 Who would have thought you could find a witness with that much courage nowadays?  

377
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,200
 Associate Judge Kim Ga On 

378
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,040
I was also very surprised.

379
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,450
The water?

380
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,580
Yes, I am sure there was something in that water.

381
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,640
 I was coughing nonstop and felt dizzy. I almost got into a car accident because of that.  

382
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,900
But you are fine now, is that right?

383
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,600
Well, I was completely fine after a little while.

384
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,690
I took a blood test just in case, and there was nothing wrong.

385
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,220
I am sure there was something in there, though.

386
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,170
 Well, different witnesses can have different stances.  

387
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,260
 It won't be a big problem,   

388
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,370
 since in the end, it's Ju Il Do who threw in his hand. 

389
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,880
 I need to do something, anything. In this horribly unfair game.  

390
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,930
Okay. Good job, Su Hyeon.

391
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,210
Oh? What's this for?

392
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,900
To thank you for going out of your way to meet the witnesses.

393
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,840
Hey, you know how to do this  stuff?

394
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,280
I thought you could only do stew or stir-fried pork.

395
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,040
- Right, don't eat it then. 
 - Wait, the coffee looks perfect.

396
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,310
You could get married, Ga On.

397
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,230
Whom will you get married to?

398
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,530
Let's go, hurry on up.

399
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,400
- Whom will you marry? 
 - The coffee's getting cold.

400
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,900
Okay.

401
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,140
Still, something smells fishy, for sure.

402
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,600
I need to look into Kang Yo Han some more.

403
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,280
Well, I've looked into everything I could for now.

404
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,790
- Su Hyeon. 
 - Yes?

405
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:45,460
I ran into some people not long ago.

406
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,730
 They all grabbed my hands tightly.  

407
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,200
 They thanked me for the trial  

408
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,200
 and told me they were happy to have found someone they could trust.  

409
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,880
So?

410
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,780
That doesn't mean a judge can do weird stuff as Kang Yo Han did.

411
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,490
The little you've seen and heard is strange enough.

412
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,900
A foul is a foul.

413
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,100
And that's also a crime.

414
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,190
Yes, you're right.

415
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,950
- Let me know if you learn anything. 
 - Yeah.

416
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,970
I should repay you for feeding me.

417
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,430
But Ga On.

418
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,880
Let me do the digging.

419
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,200
I hope you stay out of it.

420
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,320
- Why? 
 - Why, you ask?

421
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,840
It took you so much to come all the way here.

422
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,750
And I understand that you feel eternally indebted to Professor Min,

423
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,090
but I feel like he's asked you too much.

424
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,090
How can a judge wiretap and secretly investigate someone?

425
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,220
It wasn't necessarily because he asked.

426
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,030
Still.

427
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,400
Is this... the best you could do?

428
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,700
Yes, sir.

429
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,890
We recruited the best chefs, running the risk of litigation—

430
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,950
So you're telling me

431
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,460
that you risked lawsuits to recruit the best chefs or whatever, just for this?

432
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,310
- I apologize. 
 - I apologize.

433
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,470
It's not the same taste.

434
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,760
It doesn't taste like what I had in that shop!

435
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,100
You're using all my money, so why can't you imitate that simple thing?

436
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,640
Can we take over the market with this? Huh?

437
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,380
We felt we reproduced it almost perfectly.

438
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,490
What? "Almost"? "Almost"?

439
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:59,790
The devil of marron cake is in the details. I told you a thousand times.

440
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,210
Goddammit.

441
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,930
Bring me a tissue.

442
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,700
Here, sir.

443
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,060
- Eat it. 
 - Pardon me?

444
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,370
Eat it. Your team made it, so you eat it all. Who else would eat this thing?

445
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:22,380
Sir, Director Lee is being treated for diabetes, as you may know—

446
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,150
D-Diabetes, huh?

447
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,590
Then you can get out. Quit and starve to death, I don't care.

448
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,340
No, sir. I will eat it.

449
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,790
Eat it all, okay?

450
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,950
Goddammit!

451
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,950
My head hurts so much because of that crazy bastard judge.

452
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,620
Ugh, these morons.

453
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,670
 I didn't do it. 

454
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,980
 Yes, Vice President? 

455
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,400
Where's my mom?

456
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,670
 She is out of the office briefly. 

457
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:09,180
Oh, this isn't something I can tell Mom.

458
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,540
Ugh!

459
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,590
Crazy...

460
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:23,040
I'm going crazy... she's doing all sorts of things.

461
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,390
Hey, why do you keep hitting her?

462
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,180
She should make something drinkable. It's not supposed to be sewage.

463
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,950
Hey!

464
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,140
Yes, Vice President.

465
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,950
Come closer.

466
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,080
Come closer. Closer. More!

467
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,870
You should make drinks that are drinkable.

468
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,280
How are you training your employees?

469
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,980
I'm sorry!

470
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,030
And she runs out because I just tried to educate her?

471
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,940
She thinks money is so easy to earn?

472
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,270
No. I'll have another bartender come.

473
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:58,460
Forget it. You drink all of this.

474
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,550
I'm losing my appetite to drink.

475
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,210
Move!

476
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Go home safely.

477
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,400
And one more thing.  Fire that girl.

478
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,020
Got it.

479
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,260
Where are you going?

480
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,570
Manager, I'm sorry about that.

481
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,930
Ugh, doing all sorts of things...

482
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,050
Open up.

483
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,370
Hey!

484
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,420
Where is the public transport card?

485
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,040
You— Are you following me?

486
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,880
Maybe.

487
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,850
Looks like I'm the prey you're hunting.

488
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,180
But I am not someone easy.

489
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,930
If you touch me, I won't stay still.

490
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:28,080
So let's not see each other again.

491
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,290
Let's not meet again, huh?

492
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,580
Crazy bastard.

493
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,690
Hunted prey?

494
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:55,940
You're just the bait. A fresh one.

495
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,470
That's strange.

496
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,100
What's wrong?

497
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,400
- Our next trial was regarding a special law. 
 - Yes.

498
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,000
Chief Judge sent that case to the regular court.

499
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,600
He suggested we do this one.

500
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,980
I stayed up all night reviewing such a complex case as best I could.

501
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,190
What case is it?

502
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,390
This is...

503
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,460
a case for which the penalty is only one million won  (≈ $900) .

504
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,660
One million won?

505
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,670
A petty criminal for whom the prosecutor only requested a summary judgment.* ( *So petty a crime it doesn't require a trial. )

506
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,740
A young man got drunk and punched someone. Just a simple assault with no medical issue.

507
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,100
Who is it? Can I take a look?

508
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,980
28 years old. Unemployed.

509
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:51,420
There aren't any special factors, and that must be why the prosecutor requested summary judgment right away.

510
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,760
Why would our Chief Judge insist we take the case, why this case of all cases?

511
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,070
This is unusual, look.

512
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,550
It's his first offense, but he's been investigated many times before.

513
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,260
So that would mean that he settled with his victims every time he caused trouble.

514
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,220
You're right. He's a professional at simple assault.

515
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,700
His fists must be very refined.

516
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,860
How does he hit people just hard enough that no medical certificates are issued?

517
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,200
Let's see...

518
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,590
But there is no settlement with the victims this time.

519
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,290
Maybe it's not that he didn't want to, but rather that it wasn't possible.

520
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,570
Maybe he couldn't get in touch with the victims?

521
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,080
If you think about, it's weird that he's unemployed too.

522
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,990
He must need a significant amount of money to settle with all these victims.

523
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,130
That's right.

524
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,080
Of course, if the police want to go easy on someone...

525
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,750
In such a case, they may not write down the real occupation.

526
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,210
Yep.

527
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,250
Even so, this is just a case of simple assault.

528
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,130
But what about the reputation of the live court show?

529
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,070
If we try such trivial cases like this, will it help our reputation or not?

530
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,290
- Of course not. 
 - Right?

531
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,800
Ah, I am disappointed in our Chief Judge.

532
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,800
It appears that he is quite timid.

533
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,820
Right after we did one big case, how can we  just do— and AHHH!

534
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,780
 Gangster 

535
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,200
I'm sorry. I need to take this call.

536
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,980
What did you find?

537
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,480
 A trace of Kang Yo Han. 

538
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,250
What do you mean?

539
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:31,860
I looked up every article regarding Kang Yo Han. All the comments praise him. He's basically a saint.

540
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,880
But there was an interesting comment on a community site.

541
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,660
He claims to know Kang Yo Han well. I messaged him and whatnot and barely managed to get his contact information.

542
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,540
What was the comment about?

543
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,990
 Kang Yo Han... 

544
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,160
 is the devil. 

545
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,250
 Kang Yo Han is the devil. 

546
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,940
Judge Kim?

547
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,310
What are you doing?

548
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,430
Chief Judge is asking for us.

549
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,940
- Yes? 
 - Did you call us?

550
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,500
Hello, Judges.

551
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,620
Hello, PD*.
 (producer-director of a TV show) 

552
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:27,390
It's a total commotion after the broadcast.

553
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,220
Why?

554
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:33,600
Our Chief Judge was already famous, but the two of you are also gaining a lot of attention!

555
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,000
We two as well?

556
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,910
Yes, when the verdict was pronounced, your eyes became red and you gently wiped a tear.

557
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,640
That masterpiece scene was mind-blowing.

558
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,060
Such many commenters were so excited that such a humane judge had appeared.

559
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,240
Ah, that was caught by the cameras?

560
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,120
I did it discreetly because I was afraid of being criticized for crying, as a judge.

561
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,950
Right. You are instinctively suited for broadcast.

562
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,290
What brings you here?

563
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,730
Indeed, our Judge Kim.

564
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:03,400
Haughty, chic, the very example of a cool, handsome man. Young girls are just...

565
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,740
What brings you here?

566
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,610
He wants to invite us.

567
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,320
Invite us where?

568
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:17,650
It's a fashion show that is being co-organized with our program by a charity called Social Responsibility Foundation.

569
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,760
Fashion show?

570
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,310
You know what I mean. It's a gathering for people who hand over big bucks for donations.

571
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:26,300
I know, I know.  The chairman there is very famous.

572
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,170
That philosophy ...

573
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,980
Yes, the Elder Statesman.

574
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,790
I decline. Why would a judge attend such a thing?

575
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,130
You are aware of the  current mood of our society, aren't you?

576
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,880
There should be some events that provide hope, somehow.

577
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,780
If you judges would participate, the viewers will be so encouraged.

578
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,580
If it's for a great cause like that, I do want to go.

579
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,160
But what should I wear? I don't have anything appropriate to wear.

580
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,280
I'll take care of that.

581
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:00,870
You will?

582
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,790
If it's all right with you.

583
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:05,200
I'd appreciate it.

584
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,090
What about you, Judge Kim?

585
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:09,220
Let's go.

586
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,950
I'm alright. I have things to take care of.

587
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,330
Sure, do as you please.

588
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,350
I feel like Cinderella.

589
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,290
Apparently, it's even hard for celebrities to wear this designer's clothes.

590
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:39,320
Thank you so much. I'll wear it carefully and return it.

591
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,590
- There's no need for that. 
 - Excuse me?

592
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,400
- No need to return it. 
 - Isn't this really expensive?

593
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,290
There is no one else who would wear it anyway. So please just keep it.

594
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,880
Still, how can I...?

595
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,800
- Or you can throw it away. 
 - What?

596
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,200
A light in the darkness. Hosted together by Sarang Media Group and the Social Responsibility Foundation.

597
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,650
This fashion show to benefit charity has raised its glamorous curtains.

598
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:11,840
Many honored guests are now making their entrance.

599
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:19,900
And over there? The one currently receiving the attention of the entire nation,

600
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:25,310
Chief Judge of Live Court Show, Kang Yo Han.

601
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,090
Here.

602
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,530
Chief Judge Kang Yo Han.

603
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,590
- Please look this way. 
 - Please look this way.

604
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:42,810
- Chief Judge, you look splendid. 
 - Please look this way.

605
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:53,370
Let us speak with the two star judges of Live Court Show. Please make space for them.

606
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:59,760
Judge Oh Jin Ju, you look completely transformed.

607
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,170
Can I come to such an event?

608
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:05,020
Please give us a good pose.

609
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,800
Look this way, too, please.

610
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,440
She is a natural at broadcast. We won't have to worry about Judge Oh.

611
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,230
A question for Judge Kang Yo Han. The citizens are supporting you and looking up to you.

612
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,950
If you could speak to the citizens right now...

613
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,200
I am so grateful for your encouragement and support.

614
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,840
I understand very well the feelings of those who are cheering me on.

615
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,670
Whatever obstacle I face,

616
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:35,420
I will fight with everything I have, to achieve a world in which justice is alive.

617
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:39,030
Yes, that was Chief Judge Kang Yo Han.

618
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,850
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

619
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,090
- Go ahead and look around first. I have someone to greet.
 - Hello, Judge.

620
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,200
Yes, hello.

621
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,240
Welcome. I am Jeong Seon Ah, and I work at the Social Responsibility Foundation.

622
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,130
- Ah, yes, hello. 
 - Thank you for gracing our event with your presence.

623
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:25,770
- Wow, you are like a goddess, today. 
 - Oh, don't say that. I will be stoned.

624
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,590
In the live court show,

625
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:31,460
you were the brightest star, I thought.

626
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:38,170
- No way. 
 - Please greet our chairman of the board.

627
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,490
- Yes, Director Jeong? 
 - Chairman, this is Judge Oh Jin Ju of  Live Court Show.

628
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,010
This is Chairman Seo Jeong Hak.

629
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,680
Hello, I am honored to meet you.

630
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,600
You are a maiden with a good image.

631
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,810
- She's a judge. 
 - I watched that trial, too.

632
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:07,030
During turbulent times, it's natural for the law to rise. But it's brief.

633
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:14,360
In the end, we must return to the virtuous people to tame the people's hearts.

634
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,700
Yes, I will heed your words, sir.

635
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,960
I think you will do well.

636
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:41,450
Yo Han was very different from other children.

637
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,390
From the first day of school.

638
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,590
How was he different?

639
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,010
 Kang Yo Han 

640
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,130
His expression was dark

641
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,540
and he didn't speak much.

642
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:05,310
 Will you introduce yourself? Your friends will want to know about you. 

643
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,990
 Alright, then. Anyone who wants to be seat partners with Yo Han? 

644
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,850
 Se In, will you be his seat partner? 

645
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,490
 Yes, sounds good, Teacher. 

646
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,590
 We're learning the perimeter of the rectangle. Don't fool around and write it down properly. 

647
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:39,650
 First, add the length, and the length, 

648
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,490
 with the height and height. 

649
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,120
 - Next— 
 - It's a bird! 

650
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,260
 Add... 

651
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,890
 Kids, kids, be quiet. 

652
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,490
 Kids, be quiet! 

653
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,490
 Quiet! Sit down! 

654
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,160
 Kids! 

655
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,760
 Why did you kill it? 

656
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,270
 Why would you kill it? 

657
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:15,140
 Are you crazy? Why did you do that? 

658
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,280
 You should have let it fly away. 

659
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,860
 Why did he kill the bird? 

660
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,000
 Why did you kill it? 

661
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:33,200
Since then, kids called Yo Han a monster.

662
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,620
Nobody talked to him.

663
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,950
You could say he was treated like an invisible person.

664
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:45,320
I see.

665
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,180
Is that why you wrote that comment? That he's the devil?

666
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,450
No. Compared to what would happen after that,

667
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,980
that was nothing.

668
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:01,520
At that time, the school was divided by the upper neighborhood and the lower neighborhood.

669
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,660
The kids from the upper neighborhood had plenty, and the kids from the lower neighborhood were poor.

670
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:11,390
There was a similarity though, that they all treated Yo Han as if he were a monster.

671
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:14,290
 Shoot him in the head. 

672
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:18,440
 What is that? 

673
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,000
 Hit him in the eye. 

674
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,760
 Nice! 

675
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,570
 Look at his face. 

676
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,440
 You totally hit him good. 

677
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,450
Minister.

678
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,730
- Congratulations, Judge Kang. 
 - Thank you for coming. It's an honor.

679
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,670
You showed that justice is still alive in our nation. You are splendid.

680
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,570
Thank you.

681
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:01,600
- But I was a bit surprised, Judge Kang. 
 - Don't mention it.

682
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,510
 Can you pose for the camera? 

683
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,600
Will you do that again?

684
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,820
Of course not.

685
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,190
Please look to the front.

686
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:24,450
Dear guests, we have a special event prepared for tonight.

687
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,490
- I think it's starting. 
 - Enjoy.

688
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,820
- All right. I'll see you later. 
 - See you again.

689
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,640
Throw away your selfishness and with a benevolent heart...

690
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,100
It's been a long time, Chairman.

691
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,070
Excuse us.

692
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,440
Put your hand like this, and with only your thumb...

693
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,550
Like this...

694
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,290
You're good.

695
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,730
You're doing well.

696
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:41,210
May I cut in?

697
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:44,470
Director Jeong.

698
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,750
And then one day, it began.

699
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,990
 Where did it go? 

700
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,430
 Hey, have you seen my pencil case? 

701
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,600
 I don't know. 

702
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,800
 My dad bought it for me in America. Where did it go? 

703
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,360
At first, it just passed by, like that.

704
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:48,260
The source of trouble was that the upper neighborhood kids were often seat partners with the lower neighborhood kids.

705
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,650
As the teacher wanted them to get along with each other.

706
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,780
 Why are you looking at me like that? 

707
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,730
 Why are you looking at me? 

708
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,690
 Why are you crying? 

709
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:12,040
But only the belongings of upper neighborhood kids who sat with lower neighborhood kids began to disappear.

710
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,180
 Oh! I bought new shoes! 

711
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:18,840
 Tada! 

712
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,740
 What? It's ripped. 

713
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,810
 - Hey. You did it, didn't you? 
 - It wasn't me. 

714
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:35,670
 - Stop lying! 
 - Really! It wasn't me! 

715
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:39,440
 - You're his seat partner. 
 - Why would I ruin it? 

716
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,140
Eventually, the day came.

717
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,070
I enjoyed the first trial, Judge.

718
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,090
- Was it fun? 
 - Oh, what do you mean?

719
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:58,070
It was a different genre. I found it touching, my eyes teared up a little bit..

720
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,930
I am relieved that you enjoyed it, Director Jeong.

721
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:13,140
But you know, the thing that the sponsors of our foundation hate most is a twist.

722
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,550
Old men are like that, aren't they?

723
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:29,010
Those who have more tend to like predictable, obvious things.

724
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:34,000
Can everyone be pleased when people have individual tastes?

725
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,710
Someone who only pleases himself has no charm

726
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,790
or any usefulness.

727
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:58,220
How unfortunate.

728
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:02,490
Because I am having a great time right now.

729
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:07,790
 Where is my portable game console? 

730
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,130
 - What are you looking at? 
 - Hey. Let me see your bag. 

731
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,410
 - Why? 
 - Let me take a look. 

732
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:22,170
 Give it to me! Give it! 

733
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:26,170
 Huh? I didn't do it. I really didn't take it. 

734
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,840
 This is why I shouldn't be seat partners with beggars. 

735
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,710
 What? You put it in there on purpose, didn't you? 

736
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:36,760
 - Give it to me! 
 - Hey! 

737
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,550
Judge Kang?

738
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:19,930
Today, my family is here, too, so let's exchange greetings.

739
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,710
Honey? Honey.

740
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,600
Aigoo, Judge Kang.

741
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,680
Hello, CEO Lee Jae Gyeong.

742
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,730
Yes, that's my son. Yeong Min? Yeong Min?

743
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:34,900
You should greet him.

744
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,420
What... what?

745
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,850
Uh... what is this?

746
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:50,940
Nice to meet you, Vice President Lee Yeong Min.

747
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,760
Who...

748
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,310
That child was the devil.

749
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:14,840
 My late father was a loan shark. 

750
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,660
 A second-generation loan shark. Extremely vicious. 

751
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,630
 From that moment, the children called Yo Han a monster. 

752
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:26,670
 What? You can't imagine being raised by a person like that? 

753
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,560
Sir?

754
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,570
Yes.

755
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,130
I think he hasn't been tamed enough.

756
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:08,290
Were you looking for this?

757
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,000
So you knew.

758
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:35,650
Why do you do things like this, anyway?

759
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,910
Why do I do things like this?

760
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,570
Yes.

761
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:42,590
- Because I can. 
 - What?

762
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:45,460
Possibility is like a drug.

763
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,420
Out of the way!

764
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:08,540


765
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:48,130
♫  I don't know what my expression is  ♫

766
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:54,640
♫  in my memory of the past  ♫

767
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:01,200
♫  Even though I tried to recall it,   ♫

768
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:07,030
♫  I can't remember it at all  ♫

769
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:12,740
 The Devil Judge  
 ♫  I can't breathe I can't breathe  ♫

770
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,650
♫  Get me out of this darkness   ♫

771
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:20,150
♫  which has lost its light  ♫

772
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:25,760
♫  I can't breathe I can't breathe  ♫

773
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:31,590
♫  I cannot stop it anymore, it swallows me whole  ♫

774
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:37,110
 Only you, the citizens, can protect us. 

775
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,000
 It was because of this. 

776
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,010
 In this world, there are those who don't heed warnings and regret it later. 

777
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:46,780
 It exploded from a painting on the wall. So what if it was installed there from the beginning? 

778
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:48,690
 We have to find it before the police does. 

779
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,920
 I don't have any personal feelings about this, either. 

780
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,520
 Go tell your owner that it will be best if he comes himself. 

781
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,450
 Judge, I think we must meet. 

782
01:08:56,450 --> 01:09:00,240
 Kang Yo Han is the one I suspect.
