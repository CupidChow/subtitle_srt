00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,370
 This work is set in virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea. All characters, organizations, and events are fiction.   

8
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,170
 Episode 8   

9
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,220
The system itself is the only thing that can be completely manipulated.

10
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,290
This is the system. The system is powerless in the face of power.

11
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,130
The system in the face of a power which can manipulate whatever it pleases.

12
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:39,570


13
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,780
 Establishing Order and Cultivating Morality 

14
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,230
You know there was a fire incident which killed my hyeong. 
 (older brother) 

15
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,820
I understood up to the point they had to survive so they turned a blind eye toward my family.

16
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,250
It's human nature to behave as a human.  That is human.

17
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,230
But there's something really shocking about this.

18
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,860
They came to the hospital.  The same people.

19
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,330
 I could have really saved your brother's family but because of that fire ... 

20
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,850
 How did you survive that living hell? You're incredible, incredible, really incredible. 

21
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,060
 I really thought I was going to burn to death. 

22
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,790
 The heavens saved us. 

23
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,140
 As for me, no matter how often I think of my son, 

24
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,150
  whom I could not say an affectionate word to usually, but ... 

25
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,000
 Although I'm sorry for the loss of your hyeong, I will bury it in my heart. 

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,300
 The rest of us have to carry out his will. 

27
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,230
 Your brother's donated fortune will be invaluable to our foundation. 

28
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,530
 We'll be sharing it with love. 

29
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,500
 Think of the rest of your life as a bonus, 

30
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,600
 and we should live with a really really grateful heart like that. 

31
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,630
 - We should. 
 - We'll share more, give more, and be more grateful. Just trust us. 

32
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,360
- Amen. 
 - We can put ourselves in your shoes,

33
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,650
 and we all know how you feel. Why wouldn't we? 

34
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,820
 We were all on the same boat, in that fiery pit. 

35
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,860
  I mean it's fate that we were all on the same boat.  

36
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,370
 That's right. Yes, that's right. 

37
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,400
- Let's live a kind life. 
 - There's no one like your brother in the world.

38
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,900
 He was amazing. Thank you so much. 

39
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,370
 He was really amazing. 

40
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,980
 Why is the sunshine so nice? 

41
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,050
They were really talking without any reservations.

42
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,630
They were sincere.

43
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,630
I can't stand the hypocrisy of those people.

44
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,940
It makes me sick.

45
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sure those people are still the same now. "What did we do wrong?"

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,960
"It's a business to revive the economy, but they're persecuting us for trivial things. "

47
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,730
"It's a political conspiracy."

48
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,730
"We can't give in to this."

49
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,420
If the devil really existed in this world,

50
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,830
that would be

51
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,160
the self-pity of the powerful.

52
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:30,030
 Establishing Order and Cultivating Morality 

53
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,950
You look awful.

54
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:01,290
Think about only yourself right now. Don't think about useless things.

55
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,160
 Inmate 70618 Do Yeong Chun. 

56
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,990
Ajeossi, why are you there? Ajeossi!

57
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,000
Look at me.  Ajeossi!

58
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,020
- We are the authority.  
 - We are!

59
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,100
- The authority! 
 -The authority!

60
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,020
- It's us! 
 - It's us!

61
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,070
-The authority! 
 -The authotity!

62
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,570
 Wouldn't he take advantage of other people's pain for his own benefit? 

63
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,750
 If there is a real devil in the world. 

64
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,080
I heard among the foundation employees there are some who are willing to provide information, is that right?

65
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,040
 Anything useful? 

66
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,870
- We have people from the accounting team. 
 - Oh, is that so?

67
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,120
However ... he said he would call me back, but hasn't contacted me yet.

68
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,970
His phone is off. I'm just trying to see what's wrong.

69
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,460
Hang up for now.

70
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:26,170
These are the last words Teacher Seo left to all of us.

71
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,550
I apologize to the people.

72
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,070
 Everything is my fault. 

73
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,450
 The sin of underestimating human greed. 

74
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,810
 The sin of giving too much authority to the people who work under me. 

75
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,630
 Most of all, the sin of trusting people too easily. 

76
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,300
 All of this is my mistake that cannot be undone. 

77
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,050
 To everyone who trusted and loved me, 

78
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,940
 I have no words to offer. 

79
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,340
She is a much crazier wench than I thought.

80
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,320
 Then as for me,  

81
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,730
  I will go to prepare a message to the people.  

82
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,900
  So, please hurry and take care of that wench first.  Without fail.  

83
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,130
 - Yes.
 - All right then. 

84
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,710
 What about the meal... Are you leaving already? 

85
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,750
 Thank you for your hard work. 

86
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,670
 - Master Seo, we will just put our trust in you.
 - Goodbye. 

87
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,840
 You are amazing, Director Jeong. 

88
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,670
I have been working for years under him now.

89
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,180
 Good.  All right. 

90
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,200
 Then, why should we.... 

91
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,200
 Why should we accept your proposal instead of the Teacher's?  

92
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,740
 Can you explain that? 

93
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,610
Isn't that very obvious?

94
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,470
Master Seo is an elder respected by society.

95
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,680
As you just said,

96
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,250
even if he says just one word to the public directly,

97
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,470
public opinion is going to change to some extent.

98
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,980
 So? 

99
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,810
 What's more, if they are his last words before taking his own life... 

100
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,790
 how much would they weigh? 

101
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,480
 So, dead Master Seo is worth more than Master Seo alive? 

102
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,660
 Director Jeong, you are scary.  I didn't know you were like this. 

103
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,340
 I am scared, scared.  I like it. 

104
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,840
 All of this is my mistake that cannot be undone. 

105
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,140
 To everyone who trusted and loved me, I have no words to offer. 

106
00:12:54,140 --> 00:13:00,100
 From now on, I will personally take care of every detail of the foundation. 

107
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,760
 I will personally take responsibility as well. 

108
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,570
 As the first step, I'll deal with Jeong Seon Ah, who touched the donation money. 

109
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,220
 I will make sure to find her and make her pay for her crime. 

110
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,410
 Regardless of where she is hiding, I will surely— 

111
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,400
the criminal Jeong Seon Ah—

112
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,830
 Jeong Seon Ah... 

113
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,180
 Regardless where she is— As the first step— 

114
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,870
 I have no words to offer to the citizens of the nation. 

115
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,100
Completed.

116
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,080
Master Seo, who has lived his whole life without anything to mar his reputation,

117
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,160
took with him even the sins of people who worked under him.

118
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,570
These are those people.

119
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,640
 Social Responsibility Foundation Finance and Accounting Department 

120
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,350
When they came under suspicion, they all disappeared, after destroying the accounting data.

121
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,760
It has been discovered that they are an organized subversive force who infiltrated the foundation.

122
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,690
We will be sure to find them and make them pay for their sin.

123
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,380
 Regardless of where they are hiding. 

124
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,180
What in the world are they up to?

125
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,260
These are the people who were going to tip us off.  Instead, they were framed and made into criminals.

126
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,580
They are going with the story that they made donations but these people embezzled the money.

127
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,870
Then for now, shouldn't we make a counter statement and get to the truth of the matter—

128
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,720
"Dreadful. Cruel.  Harsh".

129
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,170
"A person is dead, so how could they say these things at his funeral?"

130
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,360
This country is exceptionally generous when it comes to death.

131
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,410
Using all the media, they will create an atmosphere of mourning for Seo Jeong Hak.

132
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,550
So that no one dares to question the last words of the deceased.

133
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:55,500
Turning a crisis into an opportunity, that's the method used by those who move the world.

134
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,970
Watch carefully.

135
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,790
 Behind those who embezzled this large amount 

136
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,050
and disappeared, there was... shockingly, really shockingly...

137
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,000
an extremist organization that led the Gwanghwamun riot.

138
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,140
What is more shocking is that the majority of them are foreigners, not Korean nationals.

139
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,850
I am suspicious if this isn't a foreign power's plot

140
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,090
to destabilize our country.

141
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,060
Right now, relevant authorities have detained the members of the organization and are questioning them.

142
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,920
But, now that they have a huge amount of money,

143
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,520
we have been thrown in a state of emergency where

144
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,250
we don't know when or where a terrorist activity or a riot may erupt. Ladies and gentlemen.

145
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,850
Who is responsible for all of this?

146
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,210
Isn't this the responsibility of the past government that was lukewarm about dealing with crime?

147
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,500
I pledge that I will not only weed out this force toxic as a poisonous mushroom, of course,

148
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,030
but also, in order to make sure that this sort of a tragedy is never repeated,

149
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,760
I will build a safe Republic of Korea,

150
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,210
founded on a more stringent law and order base.

151
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,850
I proclaim that!

152
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,520
Beloved and respected citizens of the nation,

153
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:07,920
now we will no longer be a weak country vulnerable in front of criminals, ladies and gentlemen!

154
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,310
Here, together with the newly appointed Director Jeong Seon Ah,

155
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:21,130
I will absolutely create a safe and strong Korea!

156
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,300
Cheers!

157
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,340
What can you possibly do following all the rules and procedures against such people?

158
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,130
As I said before, there is no justice in reality.  There is only a game.

159
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,980
An awfully unfair game at that.

160
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,940
You are probably having a hard time thinking about your parents, but try to collect yourself.

161
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,660
It seems that the game has started in earnest now.

162
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,920
 Favorites 

163
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,970
 Thug 

164
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,440
Su Hyeon.

165
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,550
  Yeah, Ga On.  What time is it now? 

166
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,700
Did you miss me that much?

167
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,600
I miss you, Yun Su Hyeon.

168
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,820
You came to visit me everyday at the hospital.

169
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,930
Why do you suddenly miss me?

170
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,730
I told you that I would buy you a drink when you get discharged.

171
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,160
A drink, that would be great.  I really had a hard time abstaining from alcohol.

172
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
I will buy as much as you want.

173
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
I like you today.

174
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,530
Right?

175
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,400
Ah, it hurts.

176
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,110
- Why, why?  Are you hurting somewhere?
 - Yeah, it hurts where I got injured.

177
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,350
It hurts where you got injured?

178
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,160
Come here. Let's go.

179
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,220
- But Su Hyeon.
 - Yeah?

180
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,590
Didn't you injure your head?

181
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,960
- Be quiet. 
 - Yes!

182
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,820
It's going down real easy.

183
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,020
What are you doing?  Bottoms up!

184
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,230
When are you going to tell me?

185
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,500
- What?
 - Something bad happened, right?

186
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,050
No, I just wanted to have a drink with you to congratulate you on getting discharged.

187
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,970
Kim Ga On.

188
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,560
Today, I just wanted to see you though.

189
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,130
I really should just stick to that.

190
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,050
How could something like that happen?  Does that make sense?

191
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,380
I saw him clearly with my own eyes.

192
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,900
How ... How could I forget that punk's face?

193
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,500
No, how could...

194
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,340
Something like that is beyond the prison warden.

195
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,470
And it's not possible even at the level of the commissioner of correctional service.  It's got to be above that, way above that.

196
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,250
That's right.  That's what Kang Yo Han said.

197
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:24,100
That's true. Everything does fit in neatly.

198
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,260
But it's too neat. When I am investigating,

199
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,100
I get suspicious if everything fits in too well.

200
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,790
What is Kang Yo Han's intention?

201
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,570
Knowing your past so well,

202
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,910
and taking you all the way there to show you what seems like a magic show he prepared.

203
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,870
What if, what if,

204
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,970
all of this is done with a certain intention?

205
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,770
What if Kang Yo Han is trying to shake your resolve and pull you in?

206
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,480
As expected of you, Yun Su Hyeon.

207
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,090
I will find out everything.

208
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,330
I will find out what sort of punk is doing all this.

209
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,590
If you get involved, it will become an official investigation.

210
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,400
However, I can't trust any of your superiors either.

211
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,650
- But still ...
 - Give me a little time.

212
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,990
I will go along with Kang Yo Han and try to find out more.

213
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,980
Okay?

214
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,090
It's very difficult for you, isn't it?

215
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,120
To be honest, it was a bit shocking.

216
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,720
Whoever they are, the audacity of those punks who did something like that...

217
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,030
"Audacity?"

218
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,430
It seemed like they weren't even worried about getting caught.

219
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,860
They put in there someone who doesn't even resemble him,  like it's nothing.

220
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,550
My mom, dad...

221
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,440
My parents died like that

222
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,320
and their only son

223
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,020
has no clue as to what's going on.

224
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,520
That's even more...

225
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,150
The music...

226
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,180
♫  From far away, the blowing wind  ♫

227
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:16,850
♫  Where will it quiet down?  ♫

228
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:24,340
♫  Ooh  your night  ♫

229
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:31,930
♫  Ooh illuminates me  ♫

230
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:39,600
♫  I who am in this dream within a dream  ♫

231
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:47,300
♫  am suspended endlessly.  ♫

232
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:54,880
♫  Ooh seeing you  ♫

233
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:02,000
♫  Ooh wakes me up  ♫

234
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,340
Seon Ah, you did a great job.

235
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,280
I love you.

236
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,560
Are you that proud of yourself?

237
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,700
Of course. You would know how hard I have worked to get here

238
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,050
from that damn gutter.

239
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,320
Yes, I must acknowledge this today.

240
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,050
You are really amazing.

241
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,460
Really?

242
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,190
You're right, Jeong Seon Ah is amazing.

243
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,770
But ... are you going somewhere?

244
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,140
Yes.

245
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,620
I have to go to the Young Master.

246
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,370
 This is the news. 

247
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,300
 President Heo Jung Se is announcing several measures to strengthen law and order. 

248
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,310
 He said he is fully aware of the results from the live court show started earlier this year... 

249
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,050
Let me check your bag.

250
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,170
 Police 

251
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,410
- Spread your arms. 
 - Give it to me. 
 - I said spread your arms.

252
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,360
The mood is unusual these days.

253
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,290
The higher-ups must have issued instructions  to take a firm stance.

254
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,240
I don't know what's happening to this world.

255
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,220
Judge Kim must not know because he doing important work.

256
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,880
I'm the only fool here.

257
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,350
Judge Oh, that—

258
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,110
Forget it.

259
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,310
 In order to make the strict punitive measures taken by the live court  

260
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,730
  mandatory to the general courts nationwide, they have decided to make the sentencing standards more stringent on one hand 

261
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,960
  and set up an operational support group   

262
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,130
  to actively support and promote the live court. 

263
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,700
Who is it? 
  Chief Judge Kang Yo Han 

264
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,030
Hello, Young Master.

265
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,120
Are you crazy?

266
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,350
How dare you come here as you please?

267
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,190
Nice to meet you.

268
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:33,340
I'm Jeong Seon Ah, I will be serving as the head of the Operational Support Group for the live court.

269
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,320
I look forward to your kind cooperation, Judge Kang Yo Han.

270
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,650
This is a violation of judicial independence.

271
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,190
Are you saying that judges whose sentences are beneath the new sentencing standards

272
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,290
and those who have a higher rate of dismissing warrants will be punished?

273
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,620
The Blue House is building social discipline, so the judicial branch should cooperate.

274
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,560
Is it for the judiciary to cooperate with the Blue House?

275
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,750
Without a nation, there is no judicial independence.

276
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,090
Judicial independence is necessary

277
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,290
in order for a nation to exist, Chief Justice!

278
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,930
Was being the director of the foundation not enough?

279
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:32,690
That's funny. Someone like you is going to be supporting me?

280
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,100
That hurts my feelings. I'm being sincere.

281
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,690
- Sincere? 
 - Of course.

282
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,990
I owe you my life, Young Master.

283
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,700
I messed with your sheep farm, so you could steal that spot.

284
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,160
Is that it?

285
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,960
Yes, I appreciated that, but there's much more to it.

286
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,550
It was at your house that I saw a beautiful world for the first time in my life.

287
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,260
Everything there was shining.

288
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,070
I lived so I could go back there.

289
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,520
Not as a petty thief, but as an owner.

290
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,120
As owner of the world you had me kicked out of.

291
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,320
You haven't changed at all.

292
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,020
You're just the same hungry petty thief.

293
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,270
A petty thief who doesn't even know how broken she is.

294
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:39,190
I love it when you're like this.

295
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:46,460
When you laugh at me, swear at me, hurt me. It's exhilarating.

296
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,690
That's why I want to harass you too.

297
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:57,730
Scratch you, bite you, and pick at you.

298
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,890
You still don't know me. I don't have much patience.

299
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,410
I don't discriminate between men and women.

300
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,360
I...

301
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,750
treat them the same way.

302
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,390
You and I are very similar.

303
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,410
Is that why you like me?

304
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,110
Yes.

305
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,270
How much do you like me?

306
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,230
I asked how much you liked me.

307
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,490
 DIKE 

308
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,330
What are you doing?!

309
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,630
Are you all right?

310
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,330
I'm all right. You saved my life.

311
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,130
Oh ... yes.

312
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,200
Chief, what is this—

313
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,170
Then that's all for today. I'll see you again.

314
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,450
That woman is the head of the operational support group for the live court.

315
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,460
Director Jeong is?

316
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,230
Hello, Director Jeong.

317
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,780
Judge Oh, we'll have meet in private soon, in a cozy setting.

318
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,960
What is this?!

319
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:24,200
- Chief, am I not a member of this court too? 
 - What are you talking about, all of the sudden?

320
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,660
The whole country is in a state of turmoil over what you started, and you're not telling me anything.

321
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,690
You said you'd resign, without a word of discussion between us.

322
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,120
You said you would accept tips from all the citizens.

323
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,960
Why is that woman suddenly showing up here again?

324
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,650
- Judge Oh. 
 - Just a moment, let me say one more thing.

325
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,060
I don't know what you think of me,

326
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,670
but I'm also a judge in this country and a member of this live court.

327
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,270
If you're going to be like this, then do the trials by yourself.

328
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,600
You've changed, Judge Oh.

329
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,090
"If you include me in the live court,

330
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,830
I will be honored to just sit next to you for the rest of my life."

331
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,720
Didn't you say this? That's what I remember.

332
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,020
You're become quite ambitious.

333
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,960
It's something to celebrate, but I'm wondering what brought the change?

334
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,530
I've told you everything I have to say.

335
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,820
Is this how you do it?

336
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,360
How are you going to fight the people who move the world

337
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,940
by alienating the people right next to you? If you isolate yourself?

338
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,690
Let's talk about that later.

339
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,700
Stop by the house. Elijah seemed to be restless.

340
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,780
Things are proceeding while I'm being completely excluded.

341
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,380
Seo Jeong Hak suddenly died, and now a violent organization is suddenly involved?

342
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,740
Did we get information about that captured member?

343
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,730
The National Intelligence Service is revealing nothing, saying that it is their jurisdiction.

344
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,050
These dogs and pigs ...

345
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,450
They are only taking orders from the president, huh?

346
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,510
We have a team that's gathering dirt on Heo Jung Se's personal corruption, don't we?

347
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,370
- Yes, Minister. 
 - A part of that team will need to be assigned elsewhere.

348
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,120
Where do you mean?

349
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:32,260
Jeong Seon Ah, the new chairwoman of the Social Responsibility Foundation.

350
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,290
It appears that that vixen

351
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,220
has latched onto the president.

352
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,110
How about talking over a cup of coffee?

353
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,100
Yes, it sounds good.

354
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,120
Elijah.

355
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,420
You seemed to question why I didn't include Oh Jin Ju.

356
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,430
A panel of judges consists of three so that two can have the majority.

357
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,560
Are you saying you don't need the minority?

358
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,160
But Judge Oh is a good person.

359
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,020
I don't believe in fickle things like 'belief in good faith.'

360
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:41,330
So the only things you are interested in are resentment and rage, huh?

361
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,200
At the very least.

362
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,030
Cha Gyeong Hui's sponsor, her son...

363
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,650
The reason that you've obsessively targeted Cha Gyeong Hui from the first trial,

364
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,020
is it because of that? Because of Elijah?

365
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,630
It's not such a simple matter.

366
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:11,620
As I told you before, when those who rule the world band together, there is no way to defeat them.

367
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,200
So you begin by isolating the strongest enemy.

368
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,650
Also the one that is easiest to isolate.

369
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,040
Easy?

370
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,560
Do you know why Cha Gyeong Hui is so strong?

371
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,580
Because she has everyone's weakness in her hands.

372
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,600
If she is cornered, there will be many people who will be happy.

373
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:35,490
And I covet very much the weaknesses that Cha Gyeong Hui is holding.

374
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,570
So you are saying that you will corner her further.

375
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,990
Until Cha Gyeong Hui tries to use her final card to make a deal.

376
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:47,120
If you understand, begin by examining this.

377
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,820
A list of cases that can be tried in the live court show.

378
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,990
The show must go on.  The support of the public is our only weapon.

379
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,290
But, about Do Yeong Chun ... Who exactly  is behind that?

380
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,440
I can't say.  I am still looking into that.

381
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,770
Whoever that may be, why do you think he did that?

382
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,770
He's not a political criminal or worthy of negotiation with another country, so why?

383
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,590
If we cannot find a specific reason, it's usually money.

384
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:30,220
- Money? 
 - Money is a very powerful motive. To anyone.

385
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Must we involve Judge Kim Ga On?

386
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,630
- Why go to this length— 
 - Like it or not,

387
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,960
I can't let an enemy remain immediately behind me.

388
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,170
Either I must  make him join my side,

389
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,570
  Or... 

390
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:58,590
I must get rid of him, the element of risk.

391
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,740
Elijah?

392
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,550
Come in.

393
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,690
Eating frozen food again when I'm not here?

394
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,530
What did you two talk about for so long?

395
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,820
Just boring work stuff. Can I sit down?

396
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,670
Sit down.

397
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,800
Of course, there is no way two ajeossis would talk about anything fun.

398
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,130
You're too much. I thought I was your oppa, not an ajeossi.

399
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:45,090
Never mind. Why don't you come home to this house lately?

400
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,960
Just... I've got a lot on my mind.

401
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,760
I thought a bit about what you said to me last time.

402
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,200
What was that?

403
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,760
That awful scammer who made your parents die.

404
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,130
I shouldn't have told you that. Don't be concerned about that.

405
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,270
How could I not be concerned about that?

406
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:12,400
I heard that you tried to kill yourself a number of times because of that punk!

407
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,170
Elijah?

408
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,930
- Let's kill him. 
 - What?

409
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,870
I thought about it a lot, and I think that would be best.

410
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,030
I just can't understand why our citizens' taxes

411
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,400
should be spent on giving a guy like that shelter, clothing, and three meals a day.

412
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,370
Can you even sleep? If I were you, I would feel so enraged that I could never get a decent night's sleep.

413
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,290
So I thought about it

414
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,740
and I don't think it's all that impossible.

415
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,970
I will hack into the prison system and find out the days he can leave prison

416
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,660
and then we hide, then we pounce on him...

417
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,100
- Elijah. 
 - Hmm?

418
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,400
Thank you for giving it so much thought.

419
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,830
No, I, just...

420
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,590
But I'm really fine now. Don't be so concerned.

421
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,790
Is that so? Then, well...

422
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,700
What if...

423
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,300
This is just an absurd stretch of imagination ...

424
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,440
What if someone made a complete switch of that bad guy? How would that be?

425
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,670
With some random person?

426
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,990
What? You've even imagined such an absurd thing?

427
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,980
Instead of having such useless thoughts, it would be better to just kill him—

428
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,470
I know, right? It's nonsense, isn't it?

429
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,780
Right. Who would do such a crazy thing?

430
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,140
And for what?

431
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,000
Right?

432
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,560
Unless it were a strange person with a strange purpose, why would anyone?

433
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,790
Never mind. Rest well, Elijah.

434
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,230
Sleep well, Elijah.

435
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,030
What's with him?

436
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,720
 Metropolitan Investigation Unit 
 Inspector Yun Su Hyeon 

437
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,250
I was surprised.

438
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,680
I had been thinking of you a lot, Elijah. Then you called me.

439
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,430
Well, I didn't think it would be helpful to come here with the ajeossis.

440
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,040
That one.

441
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,090
- How do you like this one? 
 - Very pretty, suits you well.

442
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,410
Well, I am a good model.

443
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,820
How about that one?

444
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,680
This one looks a bit old-fashioned...

445
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,440
I mean, rather, it looks very adult.

446
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,360
Is that right?

447
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:32,150
So is something going on with Ga On lately?

448
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,170
Ga On? Who knows?

449
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,130
What? You said you two were best friends.

450
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,640
Are you worried for him?

451
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,700
Worry? Why would I?

452
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,700
- Please wrap this one up. 
  - Yes.

453
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,990
Also the one that this ajumma was looking at earlier.

454
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,690
Yes? Ah...

455
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:57,470
'Ajumma?' No, it's fine, I don't need it.

456
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,460
Then why don't you pick something out for yourself?

457
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,060
It's no fun if I'm shopping by myself.

458
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,770
That sounds good too,

459
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,820
but how about if we visit somewhere else?

460
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,320
Somewhere else?

461
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,270
So you like him, don't you?

462
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,980
Ice cream?

463
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,730
You know what I mean.

464
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,530
Ga On?

465
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,780
Well, I can't say that I don't.

466
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,560
After all, I have a history of having confessed my love to him five times since kindergarten.

467
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,530
- Five times? 
 - And I was rejected every single time.

468
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,390
So why... ?

469
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,150
So why did I keep on confessing?

470
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,820
Right, why did I do that?

471
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,460
Well, it all began with his face, of course. He was very cute in the past.

472
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,560
And?

473
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,410
But... he cried.

474
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,770
Pardon?

475
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,490
That was the first time his family was majorly ruined.

476
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,300
So he had to quit kindergarten.

477
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,090
So he cried. He bawled.

478
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,970
And I hated seeing that so much.

479
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:09,390
I hated that he was crying, and I couldn't do anything for him.

480
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:15,070
So before I realized it, I ended up... confessing...

481
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,860
I was an idiot, huh?

482
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,450
Don't tell me that ... every time he cried...

483
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,450
Yes, I ended up seeing Ga On cry as many as five times.

484
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:51,020
Perhaps a cloud of misfortune entered his home.

485
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,440
It never stopped.

486
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,160
And just kept coming...

487
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,810
It's very late. Shall we get going now?

488
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,390
Eonni,

489
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,960
let's go together.

490
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,910
Yes, Elijah.

491
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,740
Yes, it's me.

492
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,030
You once investigated Jung Won F &amp; B, didn't you?

493
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:38,920
Yes, can you get me a few years' worth of their financial records?

494
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,510
Yes, thanks.

495
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,960
Ga On.

496
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:50,360
Sorry for being late when you must be so busy, Prosecutor Park.

497
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:55,540
I should come running when asked by Judge Kim Ga On, the most successful among my law school classmates.

498
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,250
- I'm successful? 
 - Of course. You are a star.

499
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:04,690
Give me your autograph here, so I can give it to my nephew.

500
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,240
Sure.

501
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,770
Actually, I have a request for you.

502
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,760
What is it?

503
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,000
There's a prisoner currently serving his sentence. He stole several hundreds of billions won.

504
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,020
I think the Seizure of the Proceeds of Crime Team was under the Prosecutor's Office at the time.

505
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,400
I know it's quite a difficult task but could you find out for me whether they actually seized anything?

506
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,590
Is the Live Court Show working on something related to that?

507
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,390
No, no. This is a personal matter.

508
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:29,360
I would really appreciate it if you can help me.

509
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,450
I understand.

510
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:36,990
But in return, you need to give a lot more autographs.

511
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,580
This won't be enough.

512
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,800
Sure. Thanks.

513
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,780
You're home?

514
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,540
Have you come back for good now?

515
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,310
Actually no, but I need to take care of these.

516
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,910
You shouldn't visit, you should return completely. This is your home.

517
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,950
But there are people I need to take care of over there, too.

518
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,460
How about taking care of yourself? Please.

519
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,630
Me? What about?

520
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,710
Why do I need any care? I'm living an exceedingly comfortable life as it is.

521
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,230
- Su Hyeon? 
 - Yes?

522
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,740
- What are you thinking of so intently? 
 - Well, just...

523
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,720
You know, Ga On ...

524
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,240
Professor.

525
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:34,650
- You're here. 
 - Why does this house have so many stairs?

526
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,460
Oh my legs.

527
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,460
But what brings you here so late?

528
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,400
Did you enjoy the food?

529
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,570
Why orange juice?

530
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:52,390
You shouldn't bring orange juice. You should bring soju.

531
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,440
Of course he should have. Not a sensible guy, is he?

532
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,550
I called Su Hyeon after a long while to ask how she's doing, and she said you would be here.

533
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:05,690
We work together at the Supreme Court every day. You didn't need to go out of your way to see me.

534
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:11,070
These days, I have no idea if the place we work at is an actual court of law or not.

535
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,790
I met with the chief justice today, and he was more like a military commander.

536
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:17,210
He said that all the courts in our nation need to get in shipshape line.

537
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:21,240
This kind of nation is not what I fought for in the streets during my youth.

538
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,800
We received an order to carry live ammunition.

539
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,660
I didn't become a police officer to point a gun at our citizens' chests.

540
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,660
Police brutality is growing worse.

541
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,090
If a drunkard makes some noise, the police batons—

542
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:36,020
But is that really so wrong?

543
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,700
Ga On.

544
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:44,600
It's not right for police officers to get beat up by drunkards every night either. Is that a proper country?

545
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:50,170
But once you wake a monster and it erupts, it becomes uncontrollable.

546
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:53,420
And your Live Court Show is what woke that monster.

547
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,870
So what do you plan to do about it?

548
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:58,190
I will get rid of your court.

549
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,340
Using internal channels in the judiciary is now useless.

550
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,330
So I will present this problem using citizens' groups and, once it's reported by media companies with a conscience,

551
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,140
it will trigger a parliamentary investigation by the opposition party. That's the plan.

552
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,650
Ga On.

553
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,350
You are the key to that plan.

554
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:16,990
What you've seen, heard, and learned, we need all of it.

555
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,900
- Is this a notice? 
 - It's a request.

556
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,560
And... I'm sorry.

557
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,260
I deserve to die.

558
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,870
 Associate Judge Kim Ga On 

559
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,900
Yes?

560
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,940
Can you come see me?

561
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,580
Did you look into it?

562
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,030
What do you mean?

563
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:09,790
What I gave you, the next trial cases.

564
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,800
Yes.

565
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,640
You still have a lot on your mind.

566
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,020
We're going to go somewhere together later.

567
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,060
Where else are we going again?

568
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,190
I need to show you something.

569
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,700
Where are we going?

570
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,520
I asked where we are going?

571
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,940
You're here.

572
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,580
This is a friend who helps me with my work.

573
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,760
And this is Judge Kim Ga On.

574
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,960
Nice to meet you.

575
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,370
You must be the one who did the meticulous background check on me.

576
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,240
Your skills are impressive.

577
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,130
Judge Kim was working hard too, on Judge Kang Yo Han's background check.

578
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can give you a compliment.

579
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,020
Your skills weren't that great.

580
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,080
I'm sorry, my specialty isn't that kind of job.

581
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,300
You two look heartwarming, but that is enough for your introductions.

582
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:22,060
Is he what you wanted to show me?

583
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,970
You once asked me this.

584
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:28,790
How am I going to fight against the people who control the world?

585
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,020
Well, I would say the answer is

586
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,680
making sure of the win even before the game starts.

587
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,820
How is that possible?

588
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,330
Of course, it's not easy to do it on my own.

589
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:43,710
That's why there are people who help me besides this guy. Here and there.

590
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,640
Are you saying you have assistants?

591
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,120
It's time for them to arrive.

592
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,280
Lawyer Go.

593
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,490
 I'm going to meet the lawyer today. 

594
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,710
 Chairman. 

595
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,290
 Do you admit negligence in your work? 

596
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,040
 Attorney Go, you said five years. 

597
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,780
 Five years. 

598
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,580
Jang Gi Hyeon wasn't the only you bribed?

599
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:25,940
I told you, the win must be certain even before the game starts.

600
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,420
Judge Kim, I have a lot to apologize for from the last time.

601
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,650
Then Lee Yeong Min's trial... That was impossible, how could you possibly ...?

602
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,920
You're right, that was too much.

603
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,030
But still, couldn't I at least stir the embers?

604
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,970
- The embers? 
 - It's hard to open the sluice gate at the start.

605
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,170
An aspiring actress. I like her tone.

606
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,030
Nice to meet you. I'm a fan. I even joined your fan club.

607
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:54,430
♫  There's still a drought in my mind 
 And my thoughts are drowning me all right  ♫

608

 Dike  
 ♫  Completely blind (Completely blind)  ♫

00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,820
 Hello, Your Honor! 

610
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,970
 I'm a huge fan! 

611
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,390
 You're so cool! 

612
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,190
 That man is a total psycho. 

613
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,260
 I used to work part-time in a department store parking lot. 

614
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,120
 I was so angry and resentful. 

615
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,160
♫  Oh oh oh in my place  ♫

616

617
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:21,040
I wasn't too bad, right?

618
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:25,820
♫  That's my very own inner evergreen 
 (That's my very own inner evergreen)  ♫

619
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,310
 Is it okay to accept this? 

620
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,170
 You did well. 

621
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,790
 Thank you. 

622
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,870
Are you saying we've really been putting on a show?

623
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:56,820
A show?

624
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,100
I don't care if you criticize me,

625
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,660
but you can't call our trial a fake.

626
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:09,010
It's an insult to many people who mustered up their courage.

627
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,890
We only helped to get the first word out,

628
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,690
but without the courage of those people, nothing could have been done.

629
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,200
- I'm sorry, I'm a little late. 
 - Hello.

630
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,130
Thank you.

631
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:28,660
It's nice to meet you. I work at Metropolitan Investigation Unit, I'm Jo Min Seong.

632
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,380
 I talked to the team leader, but his reaction was so weird. He was annoyed. 

633
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:36,510
 He's the one who got mad, when you said you were digging into Kang Yo Han, right? 

634
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:41,460
- You must be Su Hyeon's team leader. 
 - Yes.

635
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,620
Yun Su Hyeon seems delicate but she does her work well.

636
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,290
Sometimes she can be overzealous, though.

637
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,710
Is my chief taking good care of you?

638
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:52,410
Excuse me?

639
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,090
Money is definitely a powerful motivation for anyone.

640
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,180
Judge Kim, don't pretend to be smart.

641
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,900
Did I say something wrong?

642
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,220
Do you know why I'm helping Judge Kang?

643
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,600
Why?

644
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,310
In the household disinfectant case,

645
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,610
I lost my baby daughter.

646
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:18,200
I'd been defending a large company all my life,

647
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,450
but once I became a victim, I felt a little lost.

648
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,330
You surely know the outcome of that case, right?

649
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,010
You know what the judgment was too.

650
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,700
Lawyer Go ...

651
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,910
Don't call me a lawyer anymore.

652
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:36,470
I already betrayed my client, and now I'm not a lawyer anymore,

653
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,640
I'm just a criminal.

654
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:44,080
When all this is over, I'll pay for my crime.

655
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:51,020
This girl  was sexually harassed while she was drunk.

656
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:55,860
She had to just watch the perpetrator get released on probation.

657
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,080
The judge said

658
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:03,010
"The offender is a promising medical student and should be treated leniently."

659
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,520
Then, what about me?

660
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,840
Are you telling me to live with it

661
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,680
because I don't have much of a future?

662
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:22,680
Jo Min Seong's older sister, worked at the Saerim Department Store.

663
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,270
My sister was the head of the family and had to take care of her brother,

664
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,930
so she worked without taking any days off.

665
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:31,760
Until the moment the department store

666
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,590
started having cracks, made sounds, and eventually collapsed.

667
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:39,910
How was the sentence in that case, Judge?

668
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,360
Judge Oh!

669
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,260
You’re a chairwoman now, right?

670
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,650
I heard that you were also in charge of the operation support group of our live court.

671
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,220
I don't even have the ability, but I've been entrusted with a lot of tasks.

672
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,390
I understand that there are a lot of problems

673
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,880
in our foundation.

674
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,460
I'll try to change all that.

675
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,060
I'll cut off all ties with the politicians and conglomerates,

676
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,600
and focus on those in need. Back to our beginnings.

677
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,360
Yes, it won't be easy.

678
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,250
If there's anything I can do to help you, feel free to let me know.

679
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,960
I also really want to help.

680
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,490
You're pretty.

681
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,490
What the public needs right now is that kind of smile.

682
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,330
They need hope in times of trouble.

683
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:20,350
Smiles, tears, and friendship.

684
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:24,680
Judge Kang is mysterious and charismatic,

685
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:28,950
but he's like someone from another world.

686
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,290
That's true.

687
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:37,890
I think you should step forward.

688
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,150
Step forward?

689
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:44,360
Are you satisfied with being a shadow in the background behind Judge Kang?

690
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,980
There are many people who are concerned about Judge Kang's actions.

691
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:56,090
He paid a witness and is using the broadcast to get public support.

692
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,020
Shouldn't the live court be entrusted to someone more judge-like?

693
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,810
Some people are saying that.

694
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,420
Judge Oh.

695
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:26,320
Let's keep conversing about how to operate the live court.

696
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:31,010
Someone has to keep their eyes open and watch over things.

697
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,420
Your neck is a bit empty.

698
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:51,400
Oh my! No, no, if you do this, I'll get in trouble.

699
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,090
This is costume jewelry. For dressing up.

700
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,000
Dressing up.

701
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,650
You should be friendly,

702
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:08,920
but when you're on stage, don't miss a single moment to overpower everyone.

703
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,910
Because charm is power.

704
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,070
 Eonni Su Hyeon 

705
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,170
Eonni.

706
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,160
 Ga On, you are the key to that plan. 

707
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,230
 We need what you've seen, heard, and learned during this time, all of it. 

708
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:06,970
- Hello? 
  - Ga On, are you ready to sign autographs? 

709
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:17,930
 Team 3 traced the crime proceeds but we couldn't find any. Therefore the case should be closed.
 Approved &amp; Signed by Minister Cha Gyeong Hui 

710
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,160
 Do Yeong Chun Crime Proceeds Confiscation  Report 

711
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,730
What are you doing?

712
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:53,950
You knew about it, didn't you?

713
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,590
The time Do Yeong Chun was suddenly transferred to another prison,

714
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:59,530
the time there was maintenance work being done on the network system,

715
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:03,820
and the time the Do Yeong Chun Crime Proceeds Confiscation team was disbanded. All this happened at the same time.

716
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:09,030
While the Jung Won F &amp; B company run by her husband was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy,

717
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:11,260
Cha Gyeong Hui just became the Minister of Justice.

718
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,040
Exactly then, the scammer of several hundreds of billions,

719
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,920
who had completely hidden his criminal gains, just happened to disappear.

720
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,130
You must have found out about this much earlier than I did. Why didn't you tell me?

721
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,060
Because if you hadn't found out on your own, you would have suspected me.

722
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:27,000
- That I might have done something. 
 - So why did you ever go there in the first place?

723
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,140
Why did you go to see Do Yeong Chun, then found out he had been switched?

724
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,770
You already know that, too.

725
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,960
You wanted to show me Do Yeong Chun acting like the emperor even in prison

726
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,550
and how comfortably he was spending his days, to make me enraged, right?

727
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,510
Isn't that why you went to confirm that in advance?

728
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:44,270
To shake me up because I was picking fights with you and interfering?

729
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,220
I was hoping

730
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,290
that you would join my side.

731
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:53,440
I would have done worse, if necessary.

732
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,990
Switching him. Or whatever else.

733
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:58,440
That's how I do things.

734
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,920
And that won't change in the future.

735
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,210
- Ga On. 
 - Professor.

736
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:35,320
What's going on, that you asked to see me?

737
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,860
This boy.

738
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:43,070
Have you made your decision?

739
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:50,110
You have more gray hairs.

740
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:55,130
Who cares about change in color? It's amazing enough to have this much hair at this age.

741
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:58,970
 Who will create a safe Republic of Korea? 

742
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,930
 They won't create a safe Republic of Korea. 

743
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:05,190
 We will have to create it on our own. Shall we leave it to the police? 

744
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,840
 No, no, no, no, no. We must not. 

745
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,620
- I've been watching this all day long. 
 - It's so funny.

746
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,880
 The citizens must do it. That's right. 

747
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,480
One more drink.

748
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,600
 Just go out to the streets and look. Full of anxious people, beggars, 

749
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,030
 those with social discontent, especially foreigners. 

750
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,400
 All the heinous crimes are committed by these foreigners. What should we do? 

751
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,020
 We must clean it all up. But who will do it? 

752
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,960
"I worked hard."

753
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,210
"Please give me my unpaid wages. I worked hard."

754
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,700
Is that all the Korean that they know?

755
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,790
Flog those trashy foreigners that eat away Korea!

756
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:51,970
Flogging!  All you patriots!

757
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:55,000
We will become the real leads tonight.

758
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,180
The real owners. How? Like this!

759
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,660
We have to stop this insane flow.

760
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,540
Rage is contagious, you see.

761
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,650
But who created it?

762
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,100
What?

763
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,590
This insane flow, the rage of the people,

764
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,290
who created it in the first place?

765
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:28,690
Eonni, this...

766
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,160
This one. How do you like it?

767
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,850
It's a bit gross.

768
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:36,090
What? I like it.

769
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,880
Elijah, I'm sorry,

770
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,440
but wait here for just a moment.

771
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,420
You must not leave the car, got it?

772
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,750
What? Eonni.

773
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:58,360
Hey, hey. "We worked hard."

774
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,060
"Please pay us."

775
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,080
Hands up.

776
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,940
Put the camera down.

777
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:22,410
Were people so stupid that they became enraged just because they were stirred up?

778
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:24,980
It started from something else, didn't it?

779
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:27,550
It was the bad guys.

780
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,960
Those guys who deserve death for making innocent people shed tears of blood.

781
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:37,700
Was asking to properly punish them such an impossible request?

782
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,960
- Ga On. 
 - You should have done better.

783
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,180
If people like you had done better,

784
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,890
if people like you who even joined the Supreme Court had done your job properly,

785
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:48,220
then none of this would've needed to happen.

786
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:51,280
If the people who took those positions had done their jobs properly.

787
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,430
So in the end...

788
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:06,590
you have made your decision?

789
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,880
You were the one who

790
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,250
forced me to make a decision, Professor.

791
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:16,990
If there is no justice in reality, but only a game,

792
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:21,580
then I also want to be among the winners.

793
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,710
Are you the police?

794
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,720
Going to shoot me?

795
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,130
Shoot.

796
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,650
You can't even shoot me.

797
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:55,100
Throw that away right now.

798
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,520
Film this.

799
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,660
If you want to shoot me, please shoot me.

800
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:11,150
Is it right for a police officer to shoot an unarmed citizen in the chest?

801
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,470
Aren't you ashamed?

802
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,810
Do you regret it?

803
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,800
I will promise you one thing.

804
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:38,350
Your parent's enemies,  those who defrauded them,

805
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:41,720
and the people who switched that guy

806
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,530
will pay dearly for what they did.

807
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,250
It's not just for revenge.

808
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,770
Then?

809
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:58,820
I want to fight the world that's gone wrong.

810
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:11,090


811
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:15,920
 The Devil Judge 

812
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:24,940
♫  Mama, oh, there's something different between me and them.  ♫

813
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,600
♫  They don't need to call me hero.  I'm not your warrior.  ♫

814
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,040
♫  If you can hide, hurry and avoid me.  ♫

815
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,690
♫  Rockin' rockin' rockin' rockin' like a fire fire  ♫

816
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,940
♫  Gotta burn it all the pain  ♫

817
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:46,850
 Not those people like Heo Jung Se and Cha Gyeong Hui, 

818
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:49,090
 you should be the one to set this nation right, Young Master. 

819
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:50,490
 You want me to become the sheepdog? 

820
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:51,860
 Let's go. 

821
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,820
 - They intend to use us. 
 - So we should catch them now. 

822
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:58,140
 Your grudge and those who switched that guy. 

823
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,670
 We must fortify a more loyal organization 

824
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:03,300
 and entrust the job to them. 

825
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,650
 Do you have any idea how I'm feeling right now? 

826
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:08,610
 Is it because this is someone else's problem? Only the hunt you've planned is important to you. 

827
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:12,660
 You said you wanted vengeance. Don't hesitate. 

828
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,320
  Die!  

829
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,220
♫  All I want is peace on this tiresome night. ♫
