 A new leap forward for the whole nation. A dream village full of hope is materialized. 

10
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,090
The Dream Village of the Social Responsibility Foundation

11
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,070
is the subject of a fundraising campaign targeting the entire nation.

12
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,680
But we received a tip

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,930
that the funds received are going into the wrong pockets.

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,800
Here are the people at the core of the project.

♫  You said I'll live in the sunlight,  ♫

♫  in the sunlight,  ♫

17
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,720
Anyone giving us information on where the citizens' money is being spent

18
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,950
and the real purpose of this business

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,930
will be generously compensated at my own expense.

20
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,710
I promise you. Thank you.

Just now there

23
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,100
did he put the head of the state on a wanted list?

24
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,120
  Episode 7  
  My own face is showing on my broadcast for that kind of thing.

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,290
Hey, Chairman Park.  Is that the issue right now?

26
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,650
But isn't this a declaration of war against the country?

27
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,320
Isn't it a revolt?  A revolt? Accusing the nation's leader.

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,600
Does it make sense that he claims that the common people's money is being pocketed?

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,660
In order to save the poor,

30
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,990
I contributed so much of my own precious money.

31
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,820
Is this the only result of performing good deeds?

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,080
Is Kang Yo Han pro-Japanese or is he a commie?

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,870
What the hell is Master Seo doing?

34
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,310
What the hell is he thinking now, to just send his secretary?

35
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,120
Excuse me for saying this, but I think you're too agitated by this issue.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,490
It's just a groundless suspicion, after all.

37
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,180
Am I wrong?

38
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,870
It is groundless.

39
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,480
But what you said is strange. Be careful of how you speak.

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,550
Creating all this fuss ... What do they take us for?

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,330
Exactly! We did not come by that money easily.

42
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,020
It seems that you abducted Manager Jang Gi Hyeon.

43
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,560
Yes, I needed to talk with him.

44
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,940
"Let's make our stories match to scam the whole nation.

45
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,390
Otherwise, it might become dangerous for you too."  Is it that kind of conversation?

46
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,140
You should put it more nicely.  The details may be different but the gist of it is correct.

47
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,590
Are you saying they are different?

48
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,190
Did you really help Jang Gi Hyeon because you felt so sorry for him?

49
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,440
Haven't you told him "if you testify as I tell you to, I'll pay you when it's over"?

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,160
Since the beginning I could have felt sorry almost to the point of tears for the guy's plight.

51
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,850
Why are you jumping to conclusions about me?

52
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,190
Anyway, you didn't attack Su Hyeon.

53
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,600
Now you can believe that I am not someone who would do that.

54
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,970
There is more than enough reason to believe that you are such a person,

55
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,150
but it seems it was unnecessary for you to go so far.

56
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,050
Necessity?

57
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,300
You knew that Cha Gyeong Hui had gotten the details of  your account transactions

58
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,560
so it seems you spirited away Jang Gi Hyeon rapidly.

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,430
Well, in that situation, whether Su Hyeon, who suddenly showed up, took his bankbook or not,

60
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,980
you didn't need to bother her.

61
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,460
When you're as smart as now,  why that day

62
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,580
were you so enraged you were running like a chicken without its head?

63
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm not sure if someone who acted as if he would kill me for taking Elijah out for a while, is in a position to ask such a question.

64
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,550
Then who attacked Su Hyeon?

65
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,320
It's not someone who looks favorably upon me, to say the least.

66
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,870
What on earth is the chief doing?

67
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,610
It's that foundation. Weren't they doing good deeds?

68
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,640
They were volunteering and helping struggling people.

69
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,590
Judge Oh.  There is something I wasn't able to tell you.

70
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,670
Why was I left out?

71
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,990
A secret party where only the key members of the foundation gather.

72
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,290
So just the two dull-looking men went to such a gathering?

73
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,950
I even have a very expensive dress the chief gave me for the charity fashion show.

74
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,860
I am sorry.  But that wasn't the only infuriating point among the things I told you.

75
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,600
Of course not. It's totally inappropriate to collude with a witness.

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,250
Should I just blow this up before the press? I have a reporter I'm close to.

77
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,860
- A reporter?  
 - Yes. But she's at a fashion magazine.  It's called 'Bling Bling'.

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,890
That's not it.

79
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,030
Let's discuss this again calmly.

80
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,570
So, are you saying that the president and the chaebols* mingled comfortably together, 
  (Owners of conglomerates)   

81
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,740
and discussed the the Lee Yeong Min trial?

82
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,170
And there was some kind of vested interest deal being made too?

83
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,840
Yes.

84
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,120
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. 
 - What about the chief?

85
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,090
- Pardon? 
 - What did the chief say over there?

86
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,120
Is the chief on the same side as those people?

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,860
Why aren't you telling me anything about that?

88
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm not sure. He was quiet there.

89
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,090
Looking at him declaring war directly against them like that...

90
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,140
I don't know.  Whether he's cool or pretending to be cool.

91
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,540
It's true he paid a witness. A judge should not do that.

92
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,830
The press conference earlier, wasn't it just to put on a show?

93
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,920
And then he asked for a vote of confidence, out of the blue.

94
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,630
I keep having a feeling that we are somehow being played.

95
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,450
I was really a big fan of the chief.

96
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,900
The proud and righteous chief shined brilliantly.

97
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,730
Honestly I feel I don't know him right now.

98
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,400
 Be ambitious.  Among the judges I saw in the trial 

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,860
 Your Honor was the most brilliant. Twinkle Twinkle. 

100
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,670
 If you want to own a star that shines far away, 

101
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,030
 if you desperately want to have it, 

102
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,130
 change yourself first. 

103
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,270
 You must become as big a person 

104
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,660
 as can reach the stars. 

105
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,940
I am perfect.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,500
- Eonni. 
 - Yes?

107
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Why is your skin so bright today?

108
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,240
Our edgy Jae Hui paid me a compliment.

109
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,090
You must be feeling guilty about something.

110
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,810
That's because I am envious. I am envious.

111
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,580
Eonni, what should I do with this?

112
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,560
It's the bankbook I stole from Yun Su Hyeon.

113
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,240
Oh, the seed? Throw it away.

114
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,110
You are such a malicious queen. Why did you ask me to steal something that was not even needed?

115
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,160
It was. We need everything to make a story.

116
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,930
A story?

117
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,690
That's enough.

118
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,370
It gets critical from here. Watch over the moves of the foundation old fogeys.

119
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,900
Not Kang Yo Han?

120
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:17,240
Our wolf burst onto the farm more violently than I expected.

121
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,720
The sheep are going to get violent, since they are scared.

122
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,570
Understood. Ah, right, Eonni.

123
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,970
I think this time you will be the one announced on the foundation's homepage to give the healing mentor lecture.

124
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,050
Me?

125
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,420
Kang Yo Han put Seo Jeong Hak's picture right in the middle,

126
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,780
and insinuated that he may be pocketing the people's money.

127
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,270
If it's known outside that he is giving a lecture, the journalists will come running.

128
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,810
I hate these awkward cheesy talks.

129
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,970
- Jae Hui. 
 - Yes?

130
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,940
If you had been just a little bit faster, you could have taken Jang Gi Hyeon away,

131
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,900
right?

132
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,790
Sorry.

133
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,500
I didn't think the judge would have gone that far.

134
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,700
Let's do well.

135
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,100
You can, right?

136
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,240
I won't make mistakes.

137
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,620
You know that now we just have one more step to take, don't you?

138
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,000
If you get caught dozing off during Master Seo's lecture, I'm going to kill you.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm sick and tired of these creatures.

141
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,910
Hello, Director.

142
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,020
Are you an employee of the foundation? Why is Master Seo late today?

143
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,530
Hello, I have come in place of Master Seo today.

144
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,140
This is Jeong Seon Ah, the executive director of the foundation.

145
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,440
Is that right? Welcome, Executive Director.

146
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,580
You look so pretty. How old are you?

147
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,390
I'm 18 years old.

148
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,640
Isn't she pretty? Go along now. Go on up.

149
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Goodbye.

150
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,360
They're all either orphans or have run away from home, so they're not a good lot.

151
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,190
You'd better be careful of your valuables when you get close to them.

152
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,230
Not a good lot.

153
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,020
Excuse me?

154
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,790
You must be having a hard time, Director.

155
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,670
Don't mention it. Shall we go up then?

156
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,150
 Middle-sized Lecture Room C, D -  UP

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,630
 Social Responsibility Foundation Healing Mentor Lecture 
 Venue: Dreamland Youth Welfare Center 

158
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,420
Seo— 
   (The first Chinese character for her name, that means 'good'.) 

159
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,900
Dammit.  What is she trying to sign?

160
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,790
Seon Ah.

161
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,490
It's my name. Meaning a 'good kid'.

162
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,070
I'm all grown up, but still I'm asked to be a good kid.

163
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,080
I guess this was my mother's wish.

164
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,090
For me to grow up to be ordinary and kind.

165
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,870
Then why would she do this?

166
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:56,100
Why would she beat me up whenever she got drunk?

167
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,510
What?

168
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,420
Oh, I am sorry.

169
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,280
Seeing all of you, brings up memories of the past. How thoughtless of me.

170
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,750
- My mom did the same thing. 
 - Is that so?

171
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,220
Normally, she is nice like an angel.

172
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,290
But when she starts drinking, she starts crying and she—

173
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,780
It's because she has it hard. I think it is because she's having a hard time.

174
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,650
At first I didn't know, but now I think I know.

175
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,330
Her husband left his wife and children behind.

176
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,800
It must have been very hard to make ends meet, day after day.

177
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,120
But still she shouldn't have done that.

178
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,610
Just because you're struggling, it doesn't mean you can treat a child like that.

179
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,310
I thought my mother hated me because I was a bad girl.

180
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,920
A girl who swore, got into fights, and was caught stealing.

181
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,650
But I couldn't help myself at that time.

182
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,990
I was only surrounded by people swearing at me, making fun of me, and beating me.

183
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,780
I was always hungry.

184
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:22,490
But when I was twelve years old, I went to work for a rich family.

185
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,730
The young masters there were really handsome and kind.

186
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,390
They both smelled nice and they didn't swear. They were shining bright.

187
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,360
If I had been such a nice kid, my mother wouldn't have beat me up, would she?

188
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,280
Would she have loved me?

189
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,050
So, everyone,

190
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,230
what do you do to become a nice kid?

191
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,110
You have to become rich.

192
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,120
You have to be able to make ends meet first to become nice. The world is a jungle.

193
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,330
How to become nice when we have to bite and swallow each other whole to barely manage and survive?

194
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,140
First of all, survive. By any means.

195
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,240
If they beat you, bite them. If you lack something, steal it from them.

196
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,500
Moreover, it's going to be even more difficult for girls like you who are alone and unprotected.

197
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,270
There are men who are like beasts anywhere.

198
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,250
Whether they are well-educated or respected, they are all the same.

199
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:45,260
What do we have to do when those trashy men come at us?

200
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,190
We report him to the police?

201
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,260
No, you have to spot their weak point.

202
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,230
The law is never on our side.

203
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,390
You have to get proof, no matter what. Voice or video recording, anything.

204
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:12,050
And then you have to torment them until they die.

205
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,440
Tell them that you will destroy everything they possess.

206
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,940
Until they become a dog that gets well-tamed.

207
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,390
- Understood?  
 - Yes!

208
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,450
Please speak.

209
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,430
You have become such a wonderful person.

210
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,160
So, Teacher, does your mom love you now?

211
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,200
My mom died when I was 12 years old.

212
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,890
She got drunk and fell down the stairs in the neighborhood.

213
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,620
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,860
It's all right. It belongs to the past.

215
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,620
The lecture was so fresh and realistic.

216
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,560
Director, I was so touched.

217
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,530
I don't have much experience with this, so I was a little clumsy, right?

218
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,250
What do you mean? You did very well.

219
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,100
So, I'd like to ask you to give another moving lecture the next time, Director.

220
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,370
Sure.

221
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,190
Then please call me again next time.

222
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,650
Of course.

223
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,260
How did you know where I was?

224
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,130
Did you put a tracking device on me?

225
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,070
You've already found it. What are you asking for?

226
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,070
Where I go, whom I meet, I'll take care of everything myself.

227
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,080
Who are you to decide that?!

228
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,020
Like it or not, I'm your guardian!

229
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,150
Guardian?! Rather than you guarding me, I am just the chicken you are fattening up!

230
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,920
I think it's about time you learned that no one approaches others for no reason.

231
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,640
Aren't you tired of it? Pretending to be smart since you were a child.

232
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,500
Whenever someone reaches out their hand, you follow them like a puppy, get used or kidnapped like a fool!

233
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,600
Stop it!

234
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,690
Is it wrong to be lonely?

235
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,200
Don't talk like that.

236
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,240
You dare to lecture me on how to speak?

237
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,920
- This child is under my protection. 
 - That's right.

238
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,160
For Elijah, you're the only one she has, Chief.

239
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,440
How about being a little more honest?

240
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,940
That's funny.

241
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,480
How long have you been here to be acting as if you know us?

242
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,010
I'm sorry if I was presumptuous.

243
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,070
Let's go.

244
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,600
- Butler. 
  - Yes, Master. 

245
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,290
What's the way to talk to adolescent kids?

246
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,530
  Experts say that you should begin a conversation by listening and empathizing 

247
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,710
 and that it's important to protect their self-esteem with positive language. 

248
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,680
Forget it.

249
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,950
Just order a book for that topic.

250
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,290
 Yes, Master. 

251
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,190
You asked why I've been a son of a restaurant owner for 16 years, right?

252
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,140
Do you remember?

253
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,390
They died then.  My mom and dad.

254
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,660
When I was 16 years old.

255
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,550
Really?

256
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,920
Why?  Did they get into an accident?

257
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,920
They were defrauded by a terrible swindler, and lost everything.

258
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,800
My father committed suicide.

259
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,440
My mother collapsed from the shock, then...

260
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,990
I'm sorry.

261
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,140
I didn't know that.

262
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,950
What am I supposed to say at times like this?

263
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,980
It's okay, it happened a long time ago.

264
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,690
It's not easy to forget.

265
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,630
It's not.

266
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
It was hard for you, right? For me too.

267
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,000
I hated being alone at home, so I would sleep anywhere and hang out with anyone.

268
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,620
I was lonely, like a stray dog.

269
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,100
You're a strong girl, Elijah.

270
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,210
- I am? 
 - Of course.

271
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,370
You got through it alone, in this big house.

272
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,500
You're an amazing kid.

273
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,690
What are you talking about? Unlike you, you're sweet-talking.

274
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,180
Weren't you originally a tough guy concept?

275
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,950
Is it obvious?

276
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,680
Indeed, it's not easy to say things you don't mean.

277
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,730
You're dead.

278
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,420
You hit hard, no wonder,  it's in the family.

279
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,340
Goodnight.

280
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,200
 How to Talk to Your Adolescent Child 

281
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,530
I have to smile when I talk.

282
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,940
Just as I'm talking now.

283
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,990
What is this? It was Yo Han?

284
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,090
What was that expression?

285
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,950
What's the reason you're here?

286
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,000
"Smile when you talk".

287
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,300
- No, it's— 
 - If there's nothing...

288
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,180
How was your day?

289
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,690
What?

290
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,690
I mean, did you have a fun day?

291
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,740
Were you upset?

292
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,760
That is something we should talk about together...

293
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,090
That ... well ... You know that...

294
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,520
Yes, what?

295
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,680
That bad guy who scammed Ga On's parents,

296
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,170
who the hell is he?

297
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,400
Are you talking about Ga On again?

298
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,040
"Smile when you talk."

299
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,420
He made hundreds of billions with multi-level scams of poor people.

300
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,600
More than ten of the victims committed suicide.

301
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,200
- Really? 
 - Yes.

302
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,420
I see.

303
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,700
So that—

304
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,030
Seriously, Butler!

305
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,610
Butler, are you messing with me?

306
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,270
What if I do what's written in the book?

307
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,940
 Master, stress isn't good for your health. 

308
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,930
 - In the kitchen ...  
 - What are you saying now—

309
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,630
  One pill a day is enough, so please be sure to take it. 

310
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,540
 The Master needs to take care of himself, at his age. 

311
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,970
Forget it, get lost.

312
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,260
All right, then, l will get started. 
  The Blue House   

313
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:54,200
With respect to the unexpected remarks made by Judge Kang Yo Han at the people's court,

314
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,720
we are carefully reviewing the circumstances in various ways—

315
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,840
It's fake news!

316
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,570
Hello. I, Heo Jung Se, have come this far through all kinds of slander.

317
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,500
Now even a Korean judge is spreading fake news about me.

318
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,440
Can we call this a nation?

319
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,780
Judge Kang Yo Han, who is spreading false rumors in this difficult situation,

320
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,880
is he really one of the people of Korea that I love and respect?

321
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
This is the truth.

322
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,670
I'm getting a lot of information about Judge Kang Yo Han as well.

323
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,040
Judge Kang is disturbing society by communicating secretly with foreign countries.

324
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,080
He's not pure Korean blood.

325
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,170
He's not one of us, his bloodline is different.

326
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,900
There is even a tip that Judge Kang Yo Han

327
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,810
makes his moves after receiving funds from abroad.

328
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,690
For the sake of national security, we will pay huge rewards to those

329
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,310
who report any suspicions about Judge Kang Yo Han, according to the quality of the information.

330
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,420
I'll pay you a big reward. Yes.

331
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,880
If that's the case, are you going to pay it out of your own pocket?

332
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,550
- That is all. 
 - Just one word, please.

333
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,610
Please give an answer before leaving.

334
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,040
I will organize the contents of his speech and give a press release.

335
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,660
Aren't you going too far?

336
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,150
Politics isn't a comedy, and there's a lot of talk.

337
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,980
Comedy is better.

338
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,050
When people get used to comedy or competition,

339
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,130
they won't notice the complicated things.

340
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,470
Why did I say I'd pay the reward according to the quality of the info?

341
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,720
It's a competition, a competition.

342
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,840
We're just going by the runaway entertainment train! Just like that!

343
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,890
I can't stop you, Honey.

344
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,460
I'll make them really go out of their minds.

345
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,660
Will it be all right?

346
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,870
What?

347
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,980
Ten years ago, he was an actor famous for his blunt language, but now he's the president.

348
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,220
Yes, that's right.

349
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,370
Now the president, the minister of Justice, the media owner, the chaebol,

350
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,960
they are nothing less than the Republic of Korea itself.

351
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,980
That's right, it's a fight against the country.

352
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,410
Will it be all right?

353
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,870
Do you know how they gained power?

354
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,180
It's hypocrisy, hypocrisy.

355
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,270
In times of crisis, people are moved by small acts of kindness.

356
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,820
After the outbreak of the pandemic, the foundation aggressively expanded its charity work.

357
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:21,160
But the biggest amount of money spent wasn't put into disaster relief.

358
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,180
What, then?

359
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,950
Publicity.

360
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,350
They advertised and exaggerated extensively through every possible media outlet.

361
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,250
Noblesse oblige. 
 (the obligation of honorable, generous, and responsible behavior associated with high rank) 

362
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,360
They created a new image of the upper class fulfilling its responsibilities.

363
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,450
And they used that as a weapon to seize power.

364
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,870
What do you think they could do now?

365
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,120
Recoup their capital.

366
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,310
No, it's more than that.

367
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,370
What they're doing is a massive Dream Village project that will eventually lead

368
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,100
to the creation of a concentration camp funded by nation-wide public donations.

369
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,980
They're going to put there all the homeless, the poor and those who are socially discontent.

370
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,690
And then

371
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,700
they're going to start a massive urban redevelopment project.

372
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,850
They must have purchased the land under a borrowed name, at a bargain price.

373
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,390
Did you get any real conclusive evidence?

374
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,000
It can't be that easy.

375
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,340
These are the guys who blew up judge's chambers with a bomb.

376
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,180
You still took the risk to open your cards in front of the whole country?

377
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,600
- It's fun. 
 - What?

378
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,400
It should be fun, if you're on the edge of a cliff anyway.

379
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,840
Is it fun?

380
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,160
Aren't you being too irresponsible?

381
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,100
What about Elijah?

382
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,920
Have you even thought of Elijah?

383
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,780
Always.

384
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,910
All the time.

385
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,450
Please give me all the data on the foundation you've collected so far.

386
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,570
Are you trying to help me?

387
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,470
Promise me just one thing.

388
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,590
What is it?

389
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,360
I can't become an unscrupulous lawbreaker

390
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,730
who doesn't hesitate in front of abduction, subornation of perjury and threats,

391
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,340
and who treats the good citizens like fools,

392
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,440
in front of my parents who died because of a scammer,

393
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,750
and in front of Su Hyeon.

394
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,430
A judge

395
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,770
is most powerful when he acts according to the law, Chief.

396
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,610
You can't become an unscrupulous lawbreaker ...

397
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,290
A judge is most powerful when he acts according to the law.

398
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,420
Whatever.

399
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,950
You got the public's attention by raising doubt.

400
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,340
What do you plan next?

401
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,500
Divide them.

402
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,820
 HMBN 
 Minbo 

403
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,580
If the world's rulers are united, there's no way to do it.

404
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,820
We have to shake them up first.

405
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,310
Can't we start with something like this?

406
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,570
 Minbo 

407
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,360
 Minimum wage and overtime work— 
 Corrupt Corporate Minbo Group—  

408
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,210
 ♫ Need something stronger ♫  

409
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,760
♫  I want to find some love  ♫

410
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,240
 ♫ Need something stronger ♫  

411
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,380
 Min Yong Sik, Step Down! 

412
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,410
♫  Well abiding  ♫

413
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,450
Yes, I understand. Yes, goodbye.

414
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,600
What floor is the chairman's office on?

415
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Judge?

416
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,760
It's on the 20th floor.

417
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,340
This is the first floor. Judge Kang Yo Han suddenly...

418
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,470
Judge, the chairman is in a meeting right now.

419
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,040
I'll wait.

420
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,210
Oh, you will? Then, this way.

421
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,310
- Take care of your business. 
 - Oh, yes.

422
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,970
Seven minutes thirty seconds.

423
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,070
Judge, are you just leaving?

424
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,240
I'm finished with my business.

425
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,830
 Minbo 
 297-6, Namsan-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul 

426
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,020
Goodbye.

427
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,530
You asked me to tell you if anything happened.

428
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,790
Five, four, three, two, one.

429
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,690
One and a half, and a half, and a half.

430
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,990
 Chairman Park Du Man of HMBN 
 Response 

431
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,970
Hello, Chairman.

432
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,110
 Business Closed 

433
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,560
Don't be like that, tell me, Judge Kang.

434
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,790
Is there something I don't know?

435
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,380
You know I'm always on Judge Kang's side, right?

436
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,020
You know who revealed your paying off witnesses or whatever?

437
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,870
Cha Gyeong Hui did that.

438
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,450
But do you think you can handle it?

439
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,740
You turned the entire foundation into an enemy.

440
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,940
Do you have any questions for me? I can tell you everything I know.

441
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,320
He's sucking his fingers.

442
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,830
Hey, you guys are hungry, right? I was inconsiderate. Go eat something delicious.

443
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,980
Get out of here! Eat something expensive!

444
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,130
We're all doing this to make a living, right?

445
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,920
You go ahead.

446
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,810
It's me. Our boss is meeting right now with—

447
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,540
 The things you talked about when you met Park Du Man. 

448
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,070
 Whatever came out of that jerk's mouth, you can assume that it's all lies. 

449
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,880
Whatever he gave you, it's all fake.

450
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,620
 Every time he opens his mouth, it's all lies. Every time he talks, it's all lies. 

451
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,990
Ever since that jerk was a kid ...

452
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,370
All day long, the only thing he thinks is about how to beat me.

453
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,180
 What happened to him in middle school was... 

454
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,470
 He used to say he was a college student when he was in middle school. 

455
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,340
Think about it.

456
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,110
What do you think I lack, that I would need to put my hands on the foundation money?

457
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:16,240
If there's anyone who did that, it would be only Min Yong Sik.

458
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,630
 And do you know how he seduced his wife? 

459
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,250
I'm talking about Madam Pi.

460
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,780
 That jerk took her to clubs, made her drink and then he... 

461
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,930
Minbo Group is tight on funds these days.

462
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,970
I'll get you the foundation's accounting data.

463
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,520
 I've already prepared all that. 

464
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,260
 Don't worry about that. I'll get it all ready 

465
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,280
 and give it to you just as it is. 

466
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,520
Whatever that bastard, Min Yong Sik, gave you, it's all fake.

467
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,750
Don't be deceived.

468
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,300
Is that so?

469
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,830
 Eat. Let's talk while we eat. 

470
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,570
 Have some of this. This place is good. 

471

♫  There is a drought in my mind

472
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,470

a river or an ocean goes  ♫

484
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,450
Judge Kang, could you come with me?

485
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,190
The VIP is looking for you.

486
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,600
 ("VIP" is the code name for the Korean President used by his guards) 

487
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,960
This is unexpected, Mr. President.

488
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,480
What is?

489
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,940
I didn't know you'd call me this way.

490
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,600
It was terrifying. I thought I was about to get buried somewhere.

491
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,490
What do you mean, Judge Kang?

492
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,890
You've put a big picture of me all over the country

493
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,890
and you f*cked me up like that.

494
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,550
It would be hard for me to do anything right now.

495
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,480
But you know,

496
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,230
that's why even more so,

497
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,600
people would think "would it possible that he could do it?"

498
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,170
Would the president of a country personally do such a thing

499
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,190
while there's this whole lot of noise? Wouldn't that be fun?

500
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,860
In the meantime, while the common man is wondering whether it's possible or not, time flies.

501
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,980
And there come some big celebrity scandals that make one laugh aloud.

502
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,420
If that happens, then people will quickly forget it.

503
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,250
Like baby goldfishes.

504
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,750
That's a plausible scenario.

505
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,140
Were you nervous, Judge Kang?

506
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,380
Our nation's Judge Kang Yo Han has a good suit.

507
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,340
But I think you're busy these days, going around to meet fools here and there.

508
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,460
Yes, just like now.

509
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:18,600
What the hell did those bastards give you, Judge Kang?

510
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,810
But don't you think that scenario from earlier would be interesting?

511
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:30,040
I can take that scenario and just shoot right now.

512
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,030
If that's the case ...

513
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,130
 Start a live broadcast 

514
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,760
Huh?

515
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,270
Hello, fans of Heo Jung Se's 'So Refreshing!'

516
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,300
It's nice to meet you. The president also called me today.

517
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,940
Thank you, Mr. President.

518
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,200
Wow, a lot of people have already come in from the start.

519
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,860
The comments are just pouring in.

520
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,980
Yes, I am Judge Kang Yo Han.

521
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,700
Thank you, Mr. President, for changing your mind.

522
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,360
You said you would seriously examine the allegations of the foundation.

523
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,040
- Yes. 
 - Everyone, he called me here to the Blue House

524
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,200
and asked me to take a stand together.

525
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,380
- Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
 - Yes, Judge Kang—

526
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,630
The President and I together, without a doubt, will look into

527
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:23,250
where and how your donations are being spent.

528
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,050
All right, that's it for today. Shall we shout it out together?

529
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,230
Korea's Total Change!

530
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,390
Fans of Heo Jung Se's 'So Refreshing!'

531
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,120
If you're a patriot, please subscribe and leave comments.

532
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,680
Notifications settings on too!

533
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,530
You have to wave. With a smile.

534
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,840
Brightly!

535
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,420
You already finished the analysis? That's impressive.

536
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,700
It was complicatedly twisted here and there, but I found out some holes.

537
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,970
- Holes? 
 - Publicity. They have been promoting a lot.

538
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,680
Such as, the foundation has donated 10 billion won to the Dream Village project, or they donated 20 billion won.

539
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,890
They patronizingly put it out but the amounts are too large.

540
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:18,910
Based on the size of the project announced, the national donations collected so far are enough to complete it.

541
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:24,220
They took credit as if they had donated themselves, although the project proceeded with the national donations.

542
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,280
It's just a suspicion. I need the foundation's internal accounting data to verify it.

543
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,820
The data given by Park Du Man and Min Yong Sik were also fake, right?

544
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,470
Yes, they both made it look like as if the other was embezzling.

545
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,810
There's no way those sly dogs were going to give you anything easily.

546
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,580
Did you get any tips?

547
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,530
There was nothing useful. They seemed like a joke or a false report just to get the reward.

548
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,880
- Well, we still should pay them. 
 - Excuse me?

549
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,470
- The reward. 
 - Why do you want unnecessarily to pay for this kind of tip?

550
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,410
It's not the content that matters. It's the numbers.

551
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,170
We're going to post online that a huge number of tips came in.

552
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,590
As if something big is going on.

553
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,680
Do you know what is the most important thing in deceiving people?

554
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,050
It's confidence.  An unshakeable attitude.

555
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,560
People usually get deceived by that.

556
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,150
You sound like a very skilled con artist.

557
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,620
I forgot.

558
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,580
You have a painful memory of fraud.

559
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,500
But this is a little different.

560
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,910
Have you ever seen a con man who saves the world with his own money?

561
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:12,620
 800-billion multi-level marketing fraud perpetrator Do Yeong Chun.  Punish him severely! 

562
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:18,160
 Execute Do Yeong Chun for making my family commit suicide! 

563
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,720
  - Punish him severely! 
 - Punish him severely!  

564
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,500
 Execute Do Yeong Chun for making my family commit suicide! 

565
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,620
 Execute him! Execute him! 

566
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,660
  - Punish Do Yeong Chun severely! 
 - Punish him severely! Punish him severely!  

567
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,770
 - Execute Do Yeong Chun!  
  - Execute Do Yeong Chun! 

568
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,020
 - Execute Do Yeong Chun!  
  - Execute Do Yeong Chun! 

569
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,820
  - Execute Do Yeong Chun! 
 - Execute him! Execute him! 

570
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,790
  - Punish Do Yeong Chun severely! 
 - Punish severely! Punish severely!  

571
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,910
  - Execute Do Yeong Chun! 
 - Execute him! Execute him! 

572
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,820
 It's Do Yeong Chun! 

573
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,050
 Do Yeong Chun, come out, come out!  

574
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,970
 Don't do it. 

575
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:13,960
 Don't throw your life away for a guy like that.  

576
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,700
 It's not worth it, Ga On. 

577
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,300
Su Hyeon ...

578
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,470
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

579
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,260
I'll be out of the hospital soon. Why come every day? So annoying.

580
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,940
Where is the girl who complained about why he wasn't coming today?

581
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,760
Let's protect the patient's privacy, shall we?

582
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,950
Did she go out?

583
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,360
You did that?

584
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,240
But, what the hell is Kang Yo Han doing?

585
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,040
I think it's a total scam.

586
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,770
For now, you get some rest. You need to get better first.

587
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,710
What do you mean rest? There's more than one thing I need to dig up.

588
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,990
The manipulation of the testimony, the fire at the cathedral, the truth.

589
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,140
Elijah, how's Elijah doing?

590
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,780
How hard it must have been for her, alone at such a young age.

591
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,420
You didn't think of me as a kid, did you?

592
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,050
Hey, you shameless bastard. How dare you compare yourself to that pretty girl?

593
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,630
Let's have some self-awareness, shall we?

594
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,120
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,640
You seem healthy, so I'm leaving.

596
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,990
You don't look like a guest but a guest is a guest.

597
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,040
So do you want to eat this before you go?

598
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,650
Wow, Yun Su Hyeon you're very...

599
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:26,720
Let's see how well you can cut it.

600
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,790
Okay. Let's see ...

601
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,120
What are you doing?

602
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,860
- Su Hyeon. 
 - Yes?

603
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,160
I will cut it.

604
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,820
When you cut it, there's nothing left to eat.

605
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,780
You heartless bastard.

606
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:37,050
 More than 20 reports of corruption 
   

607
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,420
 in the Social Responsibility Foundation were reported to Judge Kang Yo Han. 

608
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,610
 While the foundation has not released any official statement 

609
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,550
 except for a statement that it is groundless,  

610
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:51,000
 the public petition asking the Blue House  to reveal the truth has surpassed 100,000 signatures. 

611
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,700
Stay focused and let's work.

612
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:03,440
Hey! I heard they are giving out money for saying anything.

613
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,380
They said the money is no joke, really.

614
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,140
I have a lot of bills next month, should I try it?

615
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,830
You'll get in trouble, what if you get caught? 
  Certified Payment Reminder 

616
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:19,140
Kang Yo Han is now actively supported by those opposition party bastards. I can't believe them!

617
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,720
"The live court is a way to detract the citizen's attention."

618
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,710
"There is a possibility of violating civil rights in the live court..."

619
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:26,600
That's what they used to say, acting all virtuous ... But look at them now ...

620
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,730
That's generally what politics are all about.

621
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,600
Your enemy's enemy is your friend.

622
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,100
More importantly, the two of you over there,

623
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,500
what the hell did you give Kang Yo Han?

624
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,050
It's not a big deal, it was nothing.

625
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:43,410
I just threw him something confusing as a f*ck you.

626
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,200
You're f*cking me over, too while doing it to him?

627
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,500
Seriously, who do you think I am?

628
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,930
Anyway, if he digs into it, it's just Kang Yo Han who's going to be in trouble.

629
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,100
Then what the hell did you give him, Chairman Min?

630
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,200
If I'm gone, are you going to run a broadcasting business?

631
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,000
That's a good idea.

632
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,650
- You bastard! How can you say it? 
 - Let me go, you bastard!

633
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:05,740
Who would be most pleased to see you like this right now?

634
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:12,470
The walls crumble from the inside first. Fix it before it's too late.

635
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,790
Kang Yo Han will take action without giving us the time to breathe.

636
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,110
 Secretary: Chairman! Judge Kang Yo Han's emergency press conference is live. 

637
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,840
What is this?

638
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,870
 Informants ... 27, 28, 29, 30 

639
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,980
The tips are continuously coming in. 
  Informants - 47 people  

640
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,070
They are coming from here and there, to courageously reveal the truth.

641
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,300
Thanks to the courageous informants, the foundation's attitude is also changing.

642
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,550
You all watched the president's YouTube channel, right?

643
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:55,720
 Korea's Total Change! Heo Jung Se's 'So Refreshing!' 

644
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,340
 Here's another surprising fact. 

645
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,990
The two standing directors of the foundation gave me something, saying it was the financial records.

646
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,400
What is that?

647
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,090
It's pretty funny.

648
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:57,070
Subcontracting to a family-owned company and acquiring the land for the project in advance.

649
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,760
Coincidentally, the data provided by the two of them is the exact opposite.

650
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,180
I think we need to verify it.

651
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:07,250
But this isn't the problem. Take a look.

652
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,950
 Social Responsibility Foundation Dream Village Project Site Contribution Amount 64,970,048,000 ₩ (≈ $ 56 million). 

653
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,330
 Contribution status 

654
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:21,800
Where did this huge amount of money, donated by the foundation directors, go?

655
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:33,080
Judge Kim Ga On here checked each of the foundation's internal accounting data,

656
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,620
and found out that the donation and the actual amount that came into the foundation didn't match at all.

657
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,040
Did you really get the foundation's internal accounting data?

658
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,460
Yes.

659
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,960
A courageous whistleblower came forward.

660
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,390
If the amount doesn't match, does it mean that someone embezzled the money?

661
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,990
If it hasn't been embezzled, then there probably wasn't any donation from the beginning.

662
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,900
 The trial court's emergency reporter, Hui Gyeon, reveals corruption in the Social Responsibility Foundation 

663
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:11,260
Is Judge Kim Ga On also joining in uncovering this?

664
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,370
Yes, he is.

665
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,890
As you all know, 
  I'm against it. 

666
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:26,550
Judge Kim Ga On is famous for his tenacious principles of opposition.

667
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,560
But I'm sure you didn't know about this.

668
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,720
 I was trying to do something good. 
 Restaurant owner couple  dies after losing everything to a scammer 

669
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,570
  "Would you sponsor me?” A new multi-level marketing scheme, a series of victims. 

670
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:44,000
It's about Judge Kim Ga On's parents.

671
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,570
Judge Kim has overcome this pain.

672
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:13,130
This hypocrisy of deceiving such a good people was simply unacceptable.

673
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:22,000
After taking measures to protect the identity of the informant,

674
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,580
we will disclose all information to you.

675
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:28,180
We'll be right here in a week.

676
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,790
Thank you. 
  Coming soon 

677
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,290
Is there an informant in the foundation?

678
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,700
Do you know the informant?

679
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,490
Is it true about your parents, Judge Kim?

680
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,760
Is it true that you're the victims' son?

681
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,780
Do you have more specific story for that?

682
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,320
Judge!

683
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,560
Please say one word, Judge.

684
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,620
Judge!

685
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,050
- Judge! 
 - Hold on, hold on, please.

686
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,380
Judge!

687
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,960
Judge, give one word please.

688
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,750
Judge!

689
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,990
In the end, it boils down to this?

690
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:17,470
Was I just a tool for fraud?

691
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:22,170
What's the difference between you and them?  Is it all right to use anything to achieve your purpose?

692
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,850
You don't want to become an unscrupulous lawbreaker.

693
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,980
A judge is most powerful when he acts according to the law.

694
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,600
Doesn't that sound high and mighty?

695
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,530
This is a war.

696
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,760
What else are you going to put out next week?

697
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,760
A forged account book? A tip that doesn't exist?

698
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,470
Even if it's slow, even if it's hard, shouldn't we let it be judged properly by the law?

699
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:49,490
Is that so? You must be satisfied.

700
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:56,060
You must have been very moved by the law's stern judgment of the scammer who killed your parents?

701
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,120
- Shut up. 
 - By following all the principles and procedures you're talking about,

702
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,920
going through expensive lawyers' tricks,

703
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,890
enduring a trial that dragged on and on, only to arrive at  a 17-year prison sentence ...

704
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,020
Is this what you're talking about?

705
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,360
Is that the justice you talk about all day and night?

706
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,990
Don't talk to me like that! Damnit!

707
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,800
Ordinary citizens, like my parents,

708
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,710
participated in the jury and deliberated for a long time,

709
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:29,000
and it was a fair and lawful conclusion they reached, in spite of all kinds of tricks.

710
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,200
That's the system.

711
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,430
No matter how much you don't like it, it's the system.

712
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,890
That's what you made yourself believe, in order to be able to live on?

713
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:47,470
Did the two people who have remained at your side, Yun Su Hyeon and Min Jeong Ho, persuade you to believe it?

714
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,860
Have you been living by suppressing your own desire to stab him to death and end your own life

715
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,260
hanging on to that one belief?

716
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,660
Huh? Huh?

717
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,730
Don't talk to me like that.

718
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,030
Who do you think you are?

719
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:11,770
Who do you think you are?!

720
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,540
I want to show you something.

721
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,570
How did this... how did this happen?!

722
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:41,640
There's no way this happened. It's impossible to extract the accounting data.

723
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,730
Chairman Min, can you take responsibility for what you're saying?

724
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:47,300
What are you going to do if it's real?

725
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,660
He said a week later, a week later!

726
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,890
The whole country is watching, so what are you going to do?

727
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,730
The ratings are going to be awesome.

728
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,800
Stop it, man!

729
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,030
You son of a bitch!

730
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:06,100
I know this because I've played cards ... Kang Yo Han is bluffing right now.

731
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,260
He doesn't have a card in his hand, so he's acting stronger.

732
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:13,330
Forgive me, but ...

733
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:19,770
Kang Yo Han is the sort of person who would make his own card if he didn't have one.

734
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,030
Without blinking an eye.

735
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,730
Then we'll have to cut off his wrist!

736
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,200
It's a big match in front of the whole nation.

737
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,490
And the three of you volunteered to up the stakes of the game.

738
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:32,510
Now, if you want to reveal that Kang Yo Han's hand is fake,

739
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,690
you have to show your own hand.

740
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:38,130
Would that be all right with you?

741
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,890
Inflated donations aren't the only problem.

742
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:45,730
All the funding details related to the Dream Village, future spending plans,

743
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:52,100
and also the real purpose of this business.

744
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,040
Director Jeong!

745
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,690
Oh, I'm sorry, I dared to be presumptuous.

746
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,130
So no... So how...

747
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,800
How are you going to fix this?

748
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:12,030
Don't we have Master Seo?

749
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,400
 Fasting and praying for the country. 

750
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:48,440
So, thanks to Kang Yo Han,

751
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,850
does this old man have a chance to come back to life?

752
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:50,380
He's here.

753
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,850
- Master Seo. 
 - Master Seo.

754
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:02,120
When you are praying, it isn't at all possible to see you,

755
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,910
but today you made a very important effort.

756
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:08,290
Your faces look really bad.

757
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,100
Why?

758
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:15,690
Are you a nervous wreck with this incident?

759
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:19,190
Yes, this is a crazy mess, Master Seo.

760
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,410
I think we need to fix this before it's too late.

761
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:24,740
I think the employees have started to get strange ideas as well.

762
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:28,380
I will take care of it.

763
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,330
If Master Seo comes forward,

764
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:36,180
- then there's nothing to worry about! 
 - That's right.

765
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,680
Master Seo, there's only one person in this country who can handle this.

766
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,890
That one person is you, Master Seo.

767
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:44,240
Of course, you're the only one.

768
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,970
The last remaining true teacher in this era.

769
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:50,990
- A respected elder. 
 - You're making such a fuss.

770
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:56,090
Anyway, if I come out to the public myself,

771
01:03:56,090 --> 01:04:01,560
the people who played on the tip of Kang Yo Han's crafty tongue will die down.

772
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,190
You don't have to respond to every tidbit of idle talk.

773
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,690
You're right.

774
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:09,410
Isn't it that once you control the trend,

775
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,650
then the public's opinion will be completely reversed?

776
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:15,490
You're amazing! You got it exactly!

777
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:20,860
Still, I mean, I need you to give them something.

778
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,630
What do you mean, give them something?

779
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:31,380
The people keep quiet when they have something in their mouths.

780
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:35,290
To bite and chew on.

781
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,770
Master Seo, who are you thinking of?

782
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:45,340
What is it?  Don't we all know the right person?

783
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:50,310
While I was in a retreat, praying for my country,

784
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,870
there was someone who took care of everything for this foundation.

785
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:58,410
Are you talking about Director Jeong?

786
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:03,990
Isn't that woman, Director Jeong, someone who takes care of things very well?

787
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,140
Yes, that's still a slave.

788
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:10,080
Didn't we groom her well to be used for this kind of occasion?

789
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,200
Then how should we use Director Jeong, Master Seo?

790
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,710
But Director Jeong isn't the type to stay quiet if we just frame her like that.

791
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,460
Then, we'll have to make it so that Director Jeong

792
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,990
can't open her mouth in the first place.

793
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,910
- Right? 
 - Of course.

794
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,390
Forever.

795
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:38,850
So she can't say one word, even if she takes full responsibility for everything. Understand?

796
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,070
Yes, I understand.

797
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:47,770
Forever.

798
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:21,610
- What are you doing right now? 
 - Get off.

799
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,850
 True Correction for a Bright Future 

800
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,790
We're your fans, Judge Kang Yo Han.

801
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,270
- We are! 
 - We are!

802
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:13,480
- The authority! 
 - The authority!

803
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,520
We respect you, Your Honor.

804
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,830
- We are! 
 - We are!

805
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,770
- The authority! 
 - The authority!

806
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,760
- We are! 
 - We are!

807
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,920
- The authority! 
 - The authority!

808
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,430
- We are! 
 - We are! 
 - The authority!

809
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:37,660
 Advanced Correction to Open The Future 

810
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,440
Inmate 70618

811
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,590
Do Yeong Chun! You have visitors in room 7.

812
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:13,150
You want me to go berserk?

813
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,490
You want to see me strangle him?

814
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,130
Bastard.

815
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,450
 Inmate 70618, Do Yeong Chun. 

816
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:15,800
No. This man isn't Do Yeong Chun.

817
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,640
He's a completely different person. Something's wrong!

818
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,030
This is inmate 70618, Do Yeong Chun.

819
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:23,850
I'm telling you it's not him.

820
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:28,190
This isn't Do Yeong Chun. This is ridiculous.

821
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:29,560
He's a completely different person.

822
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,090
Violation of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes, etc.

823
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:37,130
17 years in prison. Name: Do Yeong Chun.

824
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,640
 Name: Do Yeong Chun 

825
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:49,630
Look, I don't know what's going on,

826
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:55,380
but the inmate number, resident number, and the date of entry... everything is correct.

827
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,790
There hasn't been a day

828
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,800
that I've forgotten that bastard's face, not even for a single day

829
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:14,910
No, it's not him, it's someone else.

830
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,840
Ajeossi! Why are you there?

831
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,780
Ajeossi! Why are you there?

832
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,740
Look at me. Ajeossi!

833
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,540
Let's go.

834
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:33,280
 Establishing Order and Cultivating Morality 

835
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:41,450
The system itself is the only thing that can be completely manipulated.

836
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:43,700
This is the system.

837
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:47,130
The system is powerless in the face of power.

838
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:52,110
The system in the face of a power which can manipulate whatever it pleases.

839
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:00,190
You must have been out?

840
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:05,500
No, I just wanted to get some fresh air.

841
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:11,180
It would be windy on an old body like that,

842
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,020
and your knees will get cold.

843
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:16,320
No, I'm fine.

844
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:34,200
You've aged a lot.

845
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,910
Is it because of me?

846
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:43,710
Because I'm taking advantage of your weakness and being cruel?

847
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:49,460
Not at all. It's all for my sins.

848
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,910
How dare I blame someone?

849
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,400
Really?

850
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:02,350
Wow, you're amazing.

851
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:05,650
If I were you, I think I'd blame you.

852
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:09,000
I guess a well-behaved person must be different.

853
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:19,970
Do you remember? When I first came in here to serve you,

854
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:23,920
I was pretty young then.

855
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,080
Yes, you were.

856
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:31,390
Why did you do that?

857
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:35,620
Why did you do that,

858
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,520
to a kid who had nowhere to go?

859
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:59,850
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

860
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:03,320
I never even cried.

861
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,930
Get up.

862
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,200
Let's stop now.

863
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,840
I'll forgive you.

864
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:54,480
Yes?

865
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:58,640
Yes, you're a precious person.

866
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,910
A man who will take care of this country.

867
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:04,840
Everything's already been discussed.

868
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:22,780
It's all right. Everything's going to be fine.

869
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,180
You're going to die honorably

870
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:29,270
as the respected Master Seo.

871
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:34,830
It's more than you deserve, way more than you deserve.

872
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:39,180
It's too much for an undeserving pig bastard like you.

873
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:20,720
Chairman Seo Jeong Hak of the Social Responsibility Foundation has passed away.

874
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:27,020
The deceased is said to have committed suicide to take full responsibility for the recent alleged embezzlement of donations.

875
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:31,660
The foundation staff who actually embezzled the money, destroyed all the evidence and fled.

876
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:36,110
Knowing this fact, the deceased was grieved and took up the weight of responsibility on himself.

877
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:41,630
We grieve the passing of a man who devoted his entire life to aiding the needy and cultivating himself for the nation. 
   

878
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:45,550
 The whole county is in a state of grief. 
   

879
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,220
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

880
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,410
We invite the new Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah,

881
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:57,320
who will henceforward lead the Social Responsibility Foundation.

882
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,190
 Jeong Seon Ah 
 New Chairwoman of the Social Responsibility Foundation

  ♫ I cannot stop it anymore, it swallows me whole ♫ 

889
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:04,250
 I lived so I could go back there. 

890
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,600
 As an owner of the world that you, Young Master, kicked me out of. 

891
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,580
 Once a monster starts a rampage, it doesn't know when to stop. 

892
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,790
 What are you doing right now?  

893
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:17,210
 The show should go on. The public support is our only weapon. 

894
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,840
 What could be Kang Yo Han's intentions? 

895
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,220
 You wanted to enrage me by showing me how he was spending his days comfortably, is that right? 

896
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,920
 We can get rid of the risk factors. 

897
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,700
 You're just like me, Young Master. 

898
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,930
 Is that why you like me? 

899
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:35,930
