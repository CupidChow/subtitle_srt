  Number of Participants 

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,340
Judge, the judicial council

11
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,310
made a call for a suspension of execution.

12
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,820
Who did this?

13
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,480
Judge Kim Ga On held a press conference a short while ago.

14
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,870
 The live trial is all... 

15
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,560
 manipulated. 

16
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,640
 Please be more specific. 

17
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,270
 Are you saying that Judge Kang Yo Han has been manipulating the live trial? 

18
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,880
 I will tell you instead. 

19
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,200
 It is true that Judge Kang Yo Han manipulated the live court. 

20
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,260
 He decided the outcome in advance, fabricated evidence that fit the outcome 

21
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,160
 and even flipped the lawyer to his side to match the judge's outcome. 

22
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,880
 - He flipped a lawyer in advance? 
 - Is it true? 

23
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,070
 Is that true? 

24
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,960
 Judge Kim Ga On here has already made a statement to the Supreme Court about the relevant content 

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,260
 and a fact-finding committee will meet soon. 

26
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,770
  What's going to happen to the live court then?  

27
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,600
 Once the truth is revealed, all the trials tried by  Judge Kang Yo Han 

28
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,740
 will be voided. 

29
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,530
 So, is the live court going to disappear? 

30
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,570
 What's going to happen to Judge Kang Yo Han? 

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
 Punishment execution suspended 

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
As you can see,

33
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,340
the execution of the punishment

34
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,210
has been suspended.

35
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,800
I will make a statement disclosing my viewpoint on this matter, separately.

36
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,740
 Citizens of this nation, thank you. 

37
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,990
   

38
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,650
Please release the defendant.

39
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,310
You worked hard, Judge Kang.

40
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,910
I wish you luck.

41
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,800
Defendant.

42
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,880
I will see you. I will see you again. Look forward to it.

43
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,180
What is this?

44
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,970
They're fighting amongst themselves, it's a mess.

45
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,280
They are solving our problem for us, we didn't even have to touch it, Mr. President. 
  Episode 15 

46
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,410
Cheers!

47
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,380
Cheers!

48
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,800
The Bamboo Spear guy,

49
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,700
- his life is lasting longer than I thought. 
 - What?

50
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,870
Weren't you going to cut off the electricity and stop it, if he was about to die?

51
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,960
That was just all talk. Talk, talk, talk.

52
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,910
You're more naive than you look. It was just all talk.

53
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,470
You're saying you didn't take a counter-measure on the electric chair in advance?

54
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,510
I did take a counter-measure.

55
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,730
If he couldn't handle it in the end,

56
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,580
and ended up talking in the end,

57
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,850
I would have turned up the voltage to the maximum.

58
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,750
Bamboo Spear, goodbye forever.

59
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,490
Hey. That's amazing.

60
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,450
That's why you were so relaxed.

61
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm impressed, Mr. President.

62
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I don't understand the ones pretending to be just.

63
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,060
They all grab their own ankles,

64
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,030
eventually, they get knocked down, and they fall on their heads.

65
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,870
They're collapsing on their own like that.

66
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,940
What is that? I don't get it.

67
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,770
We have to win.

68
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,610
Judge Kim.

69
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,980
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,250
Is that true?

71
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,690
Chief really did that?

72
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,040
Yes.

73
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,880
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

74
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,910
I really had no clue.

75
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,440
Then, is it true that he bought off that witness, Jang Gi Hyeon, from before?

76
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,040
What the Chief said was a lie as well?

77
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,470
I was really a second fiddle.

78
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,180
- Judge Oh. 
 - I don't care if I was a second fiddle.

79
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,040
Still, I really trusted Judge Kang.

80
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,390
And unlike me, I thought that he was a remarkable judge.

81
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,090
 Handwritten statement 
 Position: Live Court Judge 
 Name: Kim Ga On 

82
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,020
 Investigation committee's office 

83
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,400
 The first time I met Judge Kang Yo Han... 

84
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,350
 Nice to meet you. 

85
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,010
 What's wrong? 

86
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,560
 It's nothing. 

87
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,240
 You said you were Judge Kim Ga On, correct? 

88
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,560
 Yes, please take good care of me— 
 - Welcome. 

89
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,850
 For coming to the war zone. 

90
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,170
 Why do you do things like this, anyway? 

91
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,890
 - Why do I do things like this? 
 - Yes. 

92
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,770
 - Because I can. 
 - What? 

93
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,350
 Possibility is like a drug. 

94
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,070
 Sadly, there is no such thing as justice in reality. 

95
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,440
 There is only a game. A horribly unfair game. 

96
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,720
 The first time I met Judge Kang Yo Han... 

97
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,110
 It starts again. 

98
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,760
 Treating me like a monster. 

99
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,040
 Since then, kids called Yo Han a monster. 

100
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,410
 Yo Han will someday devour his older brother. 

101
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,980
 Yo Han, I'm really worried about you. 

102
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,730
 With what happened at the school too, if you keep going on like that you'll end up in serious trouble. 

103
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,080
 You are impressive, Young Master. 

104
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,260
 You eliminated your idiotic elder brother and then played the hero, 

105
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,990
 coming out of there holding his daughter in your arms so you wouldn't be suspected. 

106
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,860
 Say it again. 

107
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,150
 Did you kill your older brother too? 

108
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,700
 Isn't that basic arithmetic? One is a lesser number than two. 

109
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,640
 You like to play with numbers very much, don't you? 

110
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,890
 When the viewers press the smartphone's app button, then let's judge after looking at the numbers.  

111
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,770
 Do you call it playing with numbers? I call it democracy. 

112
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,730
 370,000 

113
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,140
 I just chose the fastest way. 

114
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,150
 For you. 

115
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,670
Why are you here?

116
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,080
You stabbed me in the back.

117
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,960
Do you still have something to talk about?

118
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,540
I'm here to say goodbye.

119
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,780
I told you.

120
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,970
That I don't want to see you reach the point where you do things you can't turn around.

121
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,710
I realized when I saw you in court

122
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,080
that it was a pretext to make Bamboo Spear open his mouth.

123
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,540
That whether he would confess or not, you were making people put blood on their hands.

124
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:28,330
After that, I would have no choice but to stand by you.

125
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,590
All right.

126
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,860
It's human nature to be obsessed with your choices being right.

127
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Using people's weakness

128
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,870
is what the devil does.

129
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Say it again.

130
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,500
In this world, if you don't bite first, you will get bitten.

131
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,740
You're telling me not to cross the line while in a fight?

132
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,010
That's so naive.

133
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,920
I chose the most expedient way.

134
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,750
To be unsure is human nature too.

135
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,920
Although we are weak, we are human beings,

136
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,000
who know how to be unsure and stop.

137
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,410
Otherwise, only the same monsters will be left.

138
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,320
Self-pitying monsters.

139
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,930
So ultimately, that's the story.

140
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,590
The words I heard all my life.

141
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,060
You too?

142
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,840
Are you also afraid of me?

143
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,190
Don't you want to become a monster like me?

144
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,890
Huh?

145
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,380
If you want to kill me,

146
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,300
please do so.

147
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,770
You weak loser.

148
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,070
Get lost.

149
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,560
I sincerely hoped

150
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,120
that you would stop.

151
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,180
 After a shocking revelation of the live court being manipulated, 
   

152
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,840
 Judge Kang Yo Han has yet to make a statement and has remained silent. 

153
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,740
 The public is shocked by the revelation of manipulation of the live court, which gave comfort to the citizens by advocating for justice, 

154
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,770
 and negative public opinion towards Judge Kang Yo Han is growing stronger. 

155
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,550
You saw my abilities, right?

156
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,720
Yeon Jeong, do you know how great your husband is?

157
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,170
I know, I know.

158
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
That Supreme Court Justice Min Jeong Ho

159
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,830
thinks he's been terrorized by Kang Yo Han's supporters,

160
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,600
so he seems really pissed off.

161
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,930
 Yes. Are cops still on the way? It's urgent! 

162
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,270
The Bamboo Spear guy did it. Incredible.

163
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,800
This is all because I spread the seeds in advance

164
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,330
and now, I see the beautiful fruit of my labor.

165
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,750
Of course, of course.

166
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,120
My sweetheart, you're the best. A genius.

167
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,020
That's a shame. No, it's a damn shame.

168
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,880
I should have seen blood this time.

169
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,110
So, we should've just used tanks to wipe out all the talkative bastards. Yes.

170
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,480
This time, I should've built a great Republic of Korea that would go down in history,

171
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
with only the patriots left behind.

172
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,370
Honey, it's good to be in history,

173
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,870
but let's not forget our original intention, all right?

174
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,850
What original intention?

175
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,280
A Great Republic of Korea, pure national blood!

176
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,900
This was our concept when we started our online broadcast.

177
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,610
I think you're too immersed in the role right now.

178
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,910
I'm worried.

179
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,070
Am I too much of a Method actor?

180
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,410
Frankly, we came in here to make money, right?

181
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,520
I hope you don't forget that. Money is all that matters in the end.

182
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,030
Indeed. The first president to use the country as a revenue model.

183
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,560
We did talk about that, right?

184
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,570
But Yeon Jeong, there is something more important than money.

185
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,170
What is it?

186
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,580
Having your name go down in history.

187
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,470
In those great and brilliant credits of history,

188
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,880
my name will be engraved as an eternal protagonist!

189
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,330
Yes. Yes, that kind of thing.

190
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,490
I saw the news.

191
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,980
Is that so?

192
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,970
Are you all right?

193
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,990
Are you worried about me?

194
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,940
What worry?

195
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,200
If you get caught,

196
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,770
this house will belong to me.

197
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,520
It has always been yours, from the beginning.

198
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,380
But, what about Ga On?

199
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,900
He won't be coming anymore now.

200
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,980
He just went back to his original place.

201
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,430
Originally,

202
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,020
it has always been only the two of us.

203
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,240
 Cheers! 

204
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,100
- Yes, professor. 
 - Ga On,

205
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,240
I can't stop thinking that Kang Yo Han

206
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,130
is related to Su Hyeon's death.

207
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,970
Professor... it's not possible ... I told you it's not the case.

208
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,210
He killed his brother for his wealth,

209
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,350
he killed Su Hyeon to cover that up ...

210
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,050
No, he isn't this kind of monster.

211
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,460
However the world sees him,

212
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,200
I know him.

213
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,500
Judge Kang is a pitiful person.

214
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,570
It's not that you don't believe me.

215
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,080
- It's that you don't want to. 
 - Professor...

216
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,860
 I understand. It was a tough day, right? 

217
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,680
 Get some rest. 

218
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,490
Kang Yo Han is no longer a threat.

219
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,290
Lifting the state of emergency and appeasing the public sentiment —

220
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,770
What are you talking about?

221
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,160
If you start something, you should finish it.

222
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,370
We will add more areas of virus detection

223
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,340
and dramatically increase the number of people we take away.

224
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,040
Mr. President, that is different from the original plan.

225
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,330
If the number of people increases too much, the capacity of the accommodation facilities –

226
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,700
Starting from now,

227
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,450
starting from now,

228
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,900
it's the president's time.

229
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,500
If I, Heo Jung Se, make a solitary decision in the face of history,

230
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
the rest of you humans

231
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,600
will just have to follow. Don't you know?

232
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,480
And you.

233
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,740
You've really  ... since a while ago ...

234
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,560
Why do you keep talking so rudely?

235
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,790
A mere woman like you. Uh?

236
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,390
More than anything else,

237
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,480
I'm going to take this opportunity to wipe them all out.

238
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,330
Those old people,

239
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,990
who don't contribute to the country at all,

240
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,220
who eat away at the welfare budget.

241
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:47,660
Those scumbags. Those disgruntled bastards swarming around for protests.

242
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,180
We'll get rid of all those surplus people

243
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,680
and build a new country. That's right.

244
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,360
A young and powerful Republic of Korea.

245
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,810
I have been talking about this since I was an Internet broadcaster.

246
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,290
Korea's Total Change!

247
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,890
This is ... This is a revolution!

248
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,910
It's a revolution that establishes the nation, Republic of Korea, properly!

249
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,170
It's a moving speech.

250
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,920
But ... Have you thought how you're going to deal with the consequences?

251
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,760
- What consequences? 
 - The more stuff you do, the bigger  the resistance.

252
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,580
What are you going to do if the citizens rush out into the streets to protest and make an uproar?

253
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,220
And so what?

254
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,040
I am the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

255
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,680
I just have to push them all aside.

256
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,110
I'll spread out the tank units in Gwanghwamun

257
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,800
and mobilize all the paratroopers.

258
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,310
Why can't I do that?

259
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,780
That's what we used to do back in the day, isn't it?

260
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,410
Damn it!

261
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,720
Wow.

262
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,110
What?

263
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,150
Wow, slap.

264
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,630
Hey.

265
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,740
What are you doing, are you crazy?

266
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,380
This crazy b*tch.

267
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,490
Hey—

268
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,790
What is this?

269
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,530
Did you plan this? Are you on one team? What are you doing?!

270
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,010
There's a limit to my patience, you son of a bitch.

271
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:43,140
You're just a clown I made into the incumbent figurehead, didn't you know?

272
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,340
Do you really think you've become some great leader?!

273
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,500
Chief of Staff Kim! It's a coup d'état! It's a coup d'état! It's a coup d'état!

274
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,110
Hey!

275
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,010
Hey! Chief of Staff Kim!

276
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,600
Listen to me carefully. You don't know what's going on here, do you?

277
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
I'm not joking, you have to believe me.

278
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,430
You have to trust me! You can really shoot them all!

279
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,830
You have to believe me! Coup d'état!

280
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,870
This is an order! You can shoot them!

281
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,420
Get you head on straight! Shoot her first!

282
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,700
Shoot her! Hurry!

283
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,260
Chairwoman.

284
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,080
It's scary.

285
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,950
It's okay, you can leave.

286
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,580
All right.

287
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,990
Hey, Chief of Staff K-Kim.

288
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,130
What are you doing not getting up?

289
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,520
Go over there and stand next to the Korean Flag. Don't get in the way.

290
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,650
Honey.

291
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,780
The great Mr. President, Your Excellency.

292
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,080
it's all business.

293
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,800
A revolution doesn't pay. History doesn't pay.

294
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,620
Why would the foundation support something like that?

295
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,170
What a fool.

296
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,850
 Can you guess why I asked to meet you separately like this? 

297
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,460
 The reason you called us separately, well, it's ... 

298
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,510
 Aren't you trying to talk about someone who's not here? 

299
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,480
 Like our great president or something like that. 

300
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,840
 Yes.  What do the two of you think? 

301
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,570
 He was pretty keyed up. 

302
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,840
 He used to be a supporting actor, but now he's the top leading man. 

303
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,080
 I understand how he feels. 

304
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,650
 If you go too far, you'll disappear in one shot, right? 

305
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,530
 I heard that this time he was going to kill the Bamboo Spear guy, if he opened his mouth. 

306
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,990
 In front of the whole nation. 

307
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,060
 That is what I am saying. He doesn't think about cleaning the fallout. 

308
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,920
 He has watched too many movies. 

309
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,400
 I asked him, what if the people stand up against him? 

310
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,230
 He said he would push them aside with tanks. 

311
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,860
 Every time he opens his mouth, it's a threat. 

312
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,380
 Our project is to redevelop Seoul cleanly and sell it to foreign investors. 

313
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,690
 Even though he doesn't know the economy, he really doesn't know anything. 

314
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,720
 Should I tell you something more surprising? 

315
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,800
 What is it? 

316
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,960
 Our president, his excellency, 

317
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,490
 is thinking of spreading a real virus around Seoul. 

318
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,750
- He is nuts. 
 - That's crazy.

319
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,200
 Where are we supposed to sell that contaminated real estate? 

320
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,990
 He doesn't have a business mind 

321
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,590
 because he's an artist. 

322
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,730
 This is dangerous. 

323
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,340
 We need to think about a plan B. 

324
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,370
 A more stable and élite one. 

325
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,190
The president and the chief justice of the Supreme Court, can do nothing.

326
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,210
They are all temporary workers that we set up.

327
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,910
He lives under a delusion.

328
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,650
There is a protagonist who never changes,

329
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,550
but he doesn't get it.

330
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,730
Shut up!

331
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,680
 DIKE 

332
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,370
Now, you look a bit lonely.

333
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,600
You have a lot of courage, coming here on your own.

334
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,050
Why, do you want to get even for that dead guy?

335
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,820
No way, you're not such an idiot.

336
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:34,480
To do something emotionally, when the deed is already done, and you have nothing to gain from it.

337
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,730
I will give you one last chance.

338
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,040
I want to give you a chance,

339
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,590
because it's you.

340
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,140
Why don't you stop bluffing,

341
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,410
since I'm giving you a chance of a lifetime now.

342
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,360
A chance to go to the Blue House instead of going to jail.

343
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,060
Why?

344
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,720
Do you need a new figurehead?

345
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,800
Is Heo Jung Se not to your taste?

346
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,280
Are you going to jail for trial manipulation?

347
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,760
Will you wear a prison uniform among all the trash you threw in there?

348
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,700
Can you handle it?

349
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,860
You're zealous, aren't you?

350
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,110
You're really amazing.

351
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,550
You're always struggling hard.

352
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,670
You've always been such a pitiful child,

353
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,670
trying to satisfy an insatiable hunger,

354
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:18,110
and daring in order to obtain the unattainable.

355
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,360
What kind of scam is he going to pull off this time?

356
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,750
Citizens,

357
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,470
I am a criminal.

358
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,090
What is this?

359
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,510
What's he doing now? 
  Breaking News: At this time, the Supreme Court's "suspected trial manipulation" press conference with Chief Judge Kang Yo Han 

360
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,060
All the allegations raised against me are true.

361
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,570
I have betrayed your faith.

362
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,820
I have been abusing the law to punish criminals.

363
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,490
Working as a judge, I felt deeply

364
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,290
that the law

365
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,000
was powerless in the face of power.

366
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,180
Seeing with my own eyes

367
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,350
the people who had money and power,

368
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,890
who had committed crimes and got away with it,

369
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,340
I wanted to make them pay for their crimes at all costs.

370
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,720
That is right.

371
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,850
I have crossed the line that I shouldn't have crossed,

372
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,570
using my anger at the reality of justice not being served,

373
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,440
as an excuse.

374
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,320
 Citizens, I am sorry. 

375
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,370
I am no longer qualified to be a judge.

376
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:09,930
As of today, I will resign as a judge,

377
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,310
and I will accept any punishment.

378
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,940
I am a criminal.

379
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,860
Please throw stones at me.

380
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,930
 Please look this way. 

381
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,500
 Do you have any intention of coming back? 

382
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,600
 What are your future plans? 

383
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,990
- Judge 
 - Judge!

384
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,160
Don't abandon us, Judge!

385
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,770
Move aside! Move aside!

386
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,840
Chief! Chief!

387
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,660
Chief!

388
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,400
- Thank you, Judge Oh. 
 - Chief ...

389
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,260
- And you as well, Director. 
 - You can't do this, Judge. You can't.

390
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,610
- Judge! 
 - Judge! You can't do this!

391
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,940
- Judge! 
 - Judge! You did nothing wrong!

392
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,000
Kang Yo Han as president!

393
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,900
As president!

394
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,860
Kang Yo Han! Kang Yo Han!

395
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,700
Kang Yo Han! Kang Yo Han!

396
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,590
Kang Yo Han! Kang Yo Han!

397
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,920
 The public's support for Judge Kang Yo Han remains. 
   

398
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,070
 Currently, there is a growing movement in support of Judge Kang Yo Han in various parts of the country– 

399
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,400
That scary bastard.

400
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,730
Chairwoman Jeong.

401
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,570
What should we do about this?

402
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,100
You're lucky, Ajeossi Heo Jung Se,

403
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,390
I need you to stay at the Blue House a little longer.

404
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,430
 Yes, Eonni. 

405
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,490
Check the opposition party's movements.

406
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,800
 After announcing an apology to the citizens today, 
   

407
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,810
 the public opinion in support of Judge Kang Yo Han nationwide — 

408
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,980
Thank you for your suggestion for president, but I think it's still too early.

409
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,290
I'm sorry.

♫  in the sunlight,  ♫

411
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:32,220
 It was a groundless controversy,  
 ♫  in the sunlight,  ♫

412
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,550
 and it has ended for now. 

413
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,350
 According to an emergency poll, 

414
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,650
 57.6% said they would support Judge Kang Yo Han 

415
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,560
 if he ran for president. 

416
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,390
 Among the opposition party, which had no clear presidential candidate, 
   

417
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,850
  competition to recruit Judge Kang Yo Hang quickly began,  

418
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:53,900
 and many people are paying attention to Judge Kang Yo Han's future actions. 

419

 Old house, blue gate, end of the uphill road. 

425
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,860
Su Hyeon was looking into the church fire incident until the last moment before her death.

426
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,280
She would have come to tell you something that day.

 Precinct Officer's Notebook 

429
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,650
That detective lady was so persistent.

430
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,400
I don't know how many times she's been to this neighborhood.

431
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,900
When was the last time she was here?

432
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,330
It hasn't been that long. Has it been about 15 days?

433
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,680
She said she found everyone else, but she couldn't

434
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,610
find the man named Jeong Joseph, who did chores at the church.

435
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,570
Is it possibly this man?

436
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,090
Oh! Yes, that's Joseph.

437
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:52,200
After that young lady was here, someone said he saw Joseph in a neighborhood in Seoul.

438
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,280
- And then what, Grandma? 
 - So that's why I called the detective lady.

439
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,230
Is that ...

440
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,830
the old house with the blue gate at the end of the uphill road?

441
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,710
That's right, that's right. That's what I told her.

442
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,150
- Can you tell me the name of the neighborhood? 
 - Yes.

443
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,930
I surely have written it down somewhere.

444
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,400
But did something happen to that detective lady?

445
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,050
No, I just need to check something.

Supreme Court Justice Min Jeong Ho will help you.

483
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:14,480
Do you promise to hide me for sure?

484
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,540
Yes. If you want, I can call the Supreme Court Justice.

485
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:31,720
There is a file of the CCTV video that was captured during the church fire incident.

486
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,990
I was the manager.

487
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:40,250
Not long after the fire incident, Judge Kang Yo Han came to see me.

488
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,960
He said, "Hand over that file and keep it a secret until you die."

489
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,230
"Then I will get you a new house and give you enough money to live comfortably."

490
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:52,480
That's why I did it. However,

491
00:46:53,930 --> 00:47:01,800
I'm ashamed to say, I made a copy of it just in case I could make money off it again.

492
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,140
Then, a few months ago, Judge Kang Yo Han sent someone to see me.

493
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,430
He asked, "Did you make a copy of it? Do you really not have any?"

494
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:15,650
He was torturing me, and I thought I was going to die at this rate.

495
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,920
In the end, I confessed and gave him the copy.

496
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,550
So, how did you get these wounds?

497
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,290
A few days ago, a detective came to see me.

498
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,740
 Is anyone home? 

499
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,400
 Who ... ? 

500
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,120
 Mr. Jeong Joseph? 

501
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,440
 Just a moment. I'm Yun Su Hyeon from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit. 

502
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,750
I told her I don't know anything. I told her if she has a question, to come with a warrant.

503
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,910
I held out like that and sent her away.

504
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,760
Last night, Judge Kang's man came to see me again.

505
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,810
Asking if I really didn't say anything to the detective and whether I'd handed over another copy.

506
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:17,080
Do ... Do you have any clues about the one who came to see you, a phone number or anything?

507
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,200
No. He came to me himself, so ...

508
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:27,430
Oh! Last night, that man parked his car on the side here.

509
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,120
Here you go.

510
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,670
Thank you very much.

511
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,680
Thank you so much.

512
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,200
It's nothing. Take a look and take your time returning it.

513
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:05,200
This man! I-it's this car.

514
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,190
- This car? 
 - Yes.

515
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,980
 First, we have to catch Kang Yo Han's subordinate. 

516
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,820
 If he's the one who killed Su Hyeon, 

517
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,150
Kang Yo Han can kill him and destroy the evidence.

518
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,760
Then, is it possible to look up a license plate number right away?

519
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,450
 Yes. One of my students is in the National Police Agency. 

520
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,840
- I will check the registered address and call you. 
 - All right.

521
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:45,960
 What the hell is on that video file? 

522
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,750
 I can't tell you that. Please don't ask me that. 

523
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,170
 If I tell you about that, 

524
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,940
 Judge Kang said he would kill me, 

525
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,020
 even if he had to chase me to the end of hell. 

526
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,380
 He is the type of man to really do that. 

527
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,290
 Just wait a little bit. 

528
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,060
 Please wait a little more. I'll find out who Kang Yo Han really is. 

529
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,840
 We're almost there, Ga On. 

530
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,360
 You have arrived at your destination. 

531
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,500
 261 Seon 3820 

532
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,530
Who are you?!

533
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,270
 YH 

534
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,690
 Hello? 

535
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,640
 Hello? 

536
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,620
 Who the hell shot Su Hyeon? 

537
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,050
 They weren't trying to shoot Yun Su Hyeon. 

538
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,420
 They were trying to get rid of our live court in the midst of the chaos. 

539
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,110
 If you want to save the world, 

540
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:40,620
 cut Yun Su Hyeon out of your life. 

541
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,200
 You can't help me and be friends with her at the same time. 

542
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,180
 It's going to be hell. 

543
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,210
 The most painful hell from which you can't escape forever. 

544
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:22,580
 Then make those who did this burn in hell's fire. 

545
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:26,510
 That's the only way to live in hell. 

546
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,430
Are you sure you won't regret it?

547
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,700
I can die if that's what you want.

548
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,460
However,

549
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,990
you will regret it.

550
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,850
For the rest of your life.

551
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,790
You killed Su Hyeon.

552
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,190
Ga On.

553
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,000
You're hurt right now.

554
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,720
It hurts so much that you want to blame someone.

555
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,820
Shut up!

556
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,310
I saw it clearly.

557
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,550
Proof that you are the killer.

558
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,460
I don't know what you saw,

559
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,730
but you should know by now.

560
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:55,710
How futile evidence can be.

561
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,580
How easily humans are fooled!

562
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,130
You killed your brother, too.

563
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,370
What?!

564
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:07,400
What could be on that video that you took from Jeong Joseph?

565
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,790
The way you set the church on fire?

566
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,740
Is it?!

567
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,650
Did you meet with Joseph?

568
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,530
Did you meet with Joseph?!

569
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,630
Back off!

570
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,080
Get away from Ga On right now.

571
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,600
Mr. Kang Yo Han.

572
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,640
You are under arrest under suspicion of abetting the murder of detective Yun Su Hyeon.

573
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,010
You have the right to an attorney, you will have the opportunity to defend yourself,

574
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,800
and you have the right to request a review of the legality of your arrest.

575
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,240
Do you believe that I did that?

576
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,140
That I killed my brother and Yun Su Hyeon?

577
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,580
And that I used you?

578
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,890
That everything I have said to you is a lie?

579
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,860
Kim Ga On.

580
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:21,420
Wow. It's really moving.

581
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,640
You ...

582
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,800
I've never seen your eyes like this before.

583
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,710
How are you here ... ?

584
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:32,530
Welcome, Chairwoman.

585
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,570
Professor.

586
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,550
Don't tell me.

587
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:51,970
There is no such a thing in the world as a recurring coincidence.

588
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:54,590
It is a coincidence that you look like Kang Isaac,

589
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:58,650
but you ending up working with Kang Yo Han? Oh, no.

590
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:01,200
That can't be a coincidence too.

591
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,450
How dare you ...

592
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,570
 I solemnly swear 

593
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:16,030
 that as a judge I will faithfully perform my duties  

594
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:19,290
 in a spirit of righteous judgement 

595
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:21,850
 in compliance with the Code of Ethics of Judges 
   

596
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:26,660
 and serve the people according 

597
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,280
 to the Constitution and law. 

598
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,320
 He looks a lot like him. 

599
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,280
 One, two, three. 

600
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,520
 Hold this. Hurry! 

601
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,620
 Please gather! 

602
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:59,240
 - You two, you take the pic. 
 - No, no. 

603
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,480
 I'll take one more. Please smile! 

604
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,290
 One, two, three. 

605
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:21,780
Who could have made Professor Min a Supreme Court Justice?

606
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:36,250
- Professor. 
 - It was a choice for greater justice.

607
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,620
You will understand it one day.

608
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,450
Ga On.

609
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:01,950
Professor. Professor.

610
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:09,810
You were the weakness I planted near the Young Master.

611
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,350
This man ...

612
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:17,580
is really dangerous.

613
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:28,590
I told you I'd make you end up lonely, Young Master.

614
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:53,030
It was all fabricated. It was all fabricated.

615
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:56,490
Kang Y— It wasn't Kang Yo Han's doing.

616
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:59,870
- This woman did it! 
 - It's no use.

617
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,990
They all work for this woman.

618
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,350
It was all your doing?

619
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:30,580
Telling the elder woman where Jeong Joseph was.

620
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:35,470
Making Jeong Joseph lie.

621
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:41,050
No, no. Everything Joseph said is true.

622
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:47,390
The young master desperately hid the truth,

623
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,510
but the man ...

624
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:53,460
the man who tortured Joseph and stole the CCTV footage wasn't the young master's subordinate.

625
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,840
To be honest, I was the one who sent him.

626
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,390
This Jeong Seon Ah did it.

627
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,910
You damn...

628
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,960
You can't.

629
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,550
You can't!

630
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:19,120
This is what the young master was desperately trying to hide.

631
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,920
You can't! Turn it off!

632
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,980
You can't! Don't do it! You can't!

633
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:32,060
Let go of me! Let go of me. Let go of me.

634
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,130
Let go of me!

635
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,460
Don't do it! Don't do it.

636
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Turn it off!

637
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,710
 Verena Cathedral 

638
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:15,770
 The body of Christ. The body of Christ. 

639
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:17,660
 Have you seen Elijah? 

640
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,080
 She's probably outside. Don't worry. 

641
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,350
 The body of Christ. 

642
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:25,430
 Bear, pray with me. 

643
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:31,340
 Put your hands together, lower your head, and close your eyes. 

644
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:36,590
 Please make Mom, Dad, and Elijah happy. 

645
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,620
 Bear, what did you pray for? 

646
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:47,190
 Bear, are you cold? I will warm you up. 

647
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:04,360
 Pat, pat, pat. 

648
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,770
 Let's go, Bear. 

649
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,840
 The body of Christ. 

650
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,510
 The body of Christ. 

651
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:25,790
 The body of Christ. 

652
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,710
Elijah.

653
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,020
You are also a pitiful man.

654
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:30,950
You were afraid that child would find out she killed her parents.

655
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:34,340
You spent your whole life trying to hide that.

656
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,200
Ga On?

657
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,020
- El-Elijah. 
 - Elijah.

658
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,620
Eli-Elijah!

659
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:04,610
- Elijah! 
 - Yo Han! Yo Han!

660
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:06,150
Elijah.

661
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:10,270
- Yo Han! 
 - Elijah!

662
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:13,360
- Elijah! 
 - Yo Han!

663
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:19,510
Yo Han! Let go of me!

664
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,010
Elijah!

665
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:24,160
Let go of me! Let go of me!

666
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,110
- Yo Han! 
 - Elijah! 
 - Let go of me!

667
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:32,980
It's time for Miss Elijah to also know the truth.

668
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,870
I'm begging you. Please don't tell her.

669
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:39,230
- Let go of me! 
 - Don't tell Elijah.

670
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:40,650
Elijah ...

671
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:47,780
Please.

672
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,450
Please don't do it! Please!

673
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:54,650
Yo Han! Let go of me! Yo Han!

674
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,950
Don't do it.

675
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,880
Yo Han. Yo Han, why ... ?

676
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:03,010
There's only one thing I wanted.

677
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:09,590
You looking at me like that.

678
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:19,900
Please.

679
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,490
Drag him out!

680
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,050
Yo Han.

681
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,710
 At that very instant, 

682
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,570
 I decided to die.
