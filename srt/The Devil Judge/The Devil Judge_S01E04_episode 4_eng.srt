 Ji Sung

 Kim Min Jung

00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,410
 Jin Young

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,290
 No Justice 

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,100
 Editor's Note.  The viewer is reminded this is FICTION. 
Flogging is NOT a judicial punishment in South Korea. 

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,520
 The Devil Judge 

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,940
 This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea.  All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional. 

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,870
 Live Court Show  

11
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,600
Kang Yo Han was an abandoned child?

12
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,600
 But his older brother Isaac was good to Kang Yo Han, you said. 

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,510
And they had a good relationship, didn't they?

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,190
Have you heard that Young Master Yo Han was a survivor of a fire?

15
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,320
Yes.

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,180
It happened only one month after Chairman passed away.

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,720
And Young Master Isaac died in that fire.

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,750
Judge! Today was really the best.

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,550
When that twist happened due to the citizen tip, 
   Episode 4 

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,060
and the ratings at that moment— you printed out the data, didn't you?

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,360
Mr. Producer, your blood pressure will rise.

22
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,630
Chief, when that settlement agreement came in yesterday,

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,700
I thought it was all over. I am ashamed as a judge.

24
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,680
No need to feel that way. Raise your head.

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,560
We are a team. You know that, don't you?

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,830
Yes, Chief.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,390
"We are a team."

28
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,800
Even the follow-up in the end was perfect too!

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,900
I filmed what just happened, too.

30
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,170
 We are a team. 

31
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,560
You did well, my baby.

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,540
- Super high ratings! 
 - Let's go!

33
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,530
Secretary Jeong...

34
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,710
Don't worry too much, Yeong Min.

35
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,420
What is going on here?

36
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,260
Am I really going to prison for 100 to 200 years?

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,160
Over something small like this? Do you think they'll dare to touch the son of the Minister of Justice?

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,840
Do you think that crazy judge bastard cares about that?

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,370
He's obsessed with getting applause from the riffraff.

40
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,190
I'm sure there will be a way. There must be.

41
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,700
There is time left before the next hearing, so please calm down, Yeong Min.

42
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,010
I will call Mom.

43
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,970
Hey, my phone.

44
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,820
 Minister Cha Gyeong Hui 

45
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,730
Hello?

46
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,480
How unexpected, Minister.

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,700
Why are you going this far?

48
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,750
 I think you will have to ask your son that question. 

49
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,180
Exactly why did he go so far with all those many people?

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,160
In his own way, he endured difficulties, and just couldn't restrain his anger at that moment.

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,340
He does not have a bad nature.

52
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,840
I am curious to know if such excuses worked on you during your days as a prosecutor, Minister.

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,410
Look here, Judge Kang.

54
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,930
 I will hang up now. 

55
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,740
Let's meet. All I need is a brief moment.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,650
Thank you for coming.

57
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,800
Anyone would think this is an improper meeting.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,040
What is it about?

59
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,150
What do I have to do?

60
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,220
What do you mean?

61
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,230
What do I have to do for you to let my son go?

62
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,420
Your son is only receiving the judgment of the law, that is all.

63
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,450
Don't lie. You pursued my son in order to target me from the beginning.

64
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,690
Is that what you think?

65
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,130
So what is it that you want from me? Don't say obvious things like 'justice' or whatever.

66
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,880
It's power, isn't it? Power?

67
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,980
You're doing this to receive the support of the public, aren't you?

68
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,580
So how about if I give you a bigger prey?

69
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,100
A chaebol*? The president?
 (member of a family-owned business conglomerate) 

70
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,170
You investigated a promising politician 19 years ago, didn't you?

71
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,180
For accepting bribes.

72
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,720
- What about it... 
 - You knew that this politician did not accept money

73
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,030
but you investigated him and had him declared guilty.

74
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,380
You were very skillful, enough to be acknowledged by those who gave you the order.

75
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,370
What are you talking about now?

76
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,370
That man, who was a 'trademark' of ethics

77
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,100
ended up committing suicide.

78
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,000
Leaving behind a son who was a middle school student.

79
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,540
While your career skyrocketed for the 19 years since that case,

80
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,040
have you thought about it? Not even once?

81
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,790
Stop saying nonsense. That investigation was done according to due process.

82
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,140
Due process, my foot. This is my condition.

83
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,770
Please confess the truth of that case to the media.

84
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,320
Once you do that, I will release your son.

85
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,090
Consider it carefully.

86
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,480
Humans don't change easily.

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,230
Isn't that true?

88
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,930
Thank you.

89
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,150
Get out.

90
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,010
- Sorry. 
 - Get out!!

91
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,260
- Butler? 
  - Yes, Master. 

92
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm hungry, is there anything to eat today?

93
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,350
 The ingredients to cook with are— 

94
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,260
Not for cooking. Anything I can  simply heat?

95
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,840
 There is pizza and beef bowl. 

96
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,400
Beef bowl sounds good.

97
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
 It's in the freezer. 

98
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,630
Did Elijah eat dinner?

99
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,430
Yes, she had a beef bowl.

100
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,130
Is her taste similar to mine?

101
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,430
Do you eat alone every day, like that?

102
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,260
Does it change anything if I eat with someone?

103
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,600
No one in this huge house? Alone?

104
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,890
The most dangerous and toxic thing in this world is a human being.

105
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,990
Do you have something you want to say?

106
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,340
No.

107
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,890
What's up?

108
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,830
What do you mean by that?

109
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,790
The toast was yummy. What's up that you made something like that?

110
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,640
- I just got here to work. 
 - Huh?

111
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,340
I'm glad you liked it.

112
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,140
What are you looking at?

113
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,640
Wouldn't it be better to get help from that man?

114
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,920
- Who? That old man? 
 - Yes.

115
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,610
What use would he be in this situation?

116
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,980
Minister, in Korea right now, which looks like being on the eve of riots,

117
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,740
there are only two places that have earned over 90% credibility recently.

118
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,780
Social Responsibility Foundation. 
     

119
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,870
Who wouldn't like it when someone hands them money? Such beggars.

120
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,000
And the other one is the Live Court Show.

121
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,070
Nothing but dogs and pigs, all of them.

122
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,920
I apologize for my impertinence, but the credibility of us prosecutors is currently 12%.

123
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,270
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

124
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,430
 Minister Cha Gyeong Hui 

125
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,910
Yes, Minister?

126
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,540
Oh, what to do? He is in the midst of meditation and not accepting any calls.

127
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,340
Can you call back later?

128
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,550
Pardon?

129
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,890
In that case, you can tell me and I will relay the message to him.

130
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,990
Yes. Of course I know.

131
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,150
That is a mother's heart, how could I not know?

132
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,920
Yes.

133
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,070
Minister, let's set things right together.

134
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,890
Yes.

135
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,260
Oh, my ears hurt. Why not just "sing the first verse?"

136
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,690
In any case, it looks like we will have to meet, Judge.

137
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,700
 Judge Kang Yo Han 

138
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,960
Are you hurt?

139
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,350
I'm sorry.

140
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,610
That's unexpected.

141
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:07,530
Not you. He never goes to anyone unfamiliar.

142
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,200
I may not look it, but I am very popular with stray cats.

143
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,090
They recognize a good person when they see one, isn't that true?

144
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,860
You make me laugh.

145
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,540
- Dumb ones don't recognize me, though. 
 - What?

146
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,730
Cats, I meant cats.

147
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,790
He's a stray cat, too.

148
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,090
He is? But he looks so expensive.

149
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,530
Yo Han brought him home. He keeps bringing strays home, which is unlike him.

150
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,820
Why do you think it's unlike him?

151
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,240
Don't tell me you also believe what they blabber on TV?

152
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,160
"Our Judge Kang Yo Han, the disciple of justice who loves the weak among us?"

153
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,920
So that isn't true?

154
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,000
You are stupid after all.

155
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,960
This cat catches mice even though we give him food every day.

156
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,550
Why do you think he does that?

157
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,490
- Not sure. 
 - Because it's fun.

158
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,020
He's doing it for fun because he is bored.

159
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,260
How do you think Yo Han became the owner of this house?

160
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,170
What do you mean?

161
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,670
As for me

162
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,380
that is the only thing I think about

163
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,100
every single day.

164
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,490
Hey, Su Hyeon. Do you think I can meet with the detective who investigated that fire case ten years ago?

165
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,550
About that—

166
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,550
Were you on an important call?

167
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,260
Don't people usually knock before entering other people's rooms?

168
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,310
Perhaps you forgot that this is my home?

169
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,640
So how long do you plan on staying here?

170
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,410
I will stay for a few more days to recover.

171
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,530
I get dizzy sometimes.

172
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,110
You seem to wander around in this house a lot.

173
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,790
Are you curious about something? Or looking for something?

174
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,050
I am not all that curious about other people's affairs.

175
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,240
Oh, is that right?

176
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,390
Let's say that's true. Shall we pick out some clothes?

177
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,720
Clothes, all of a sudden?

178
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,260
There is somewhere you need to go with me. Follow me.

179
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,850
How about this?

180
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,590
Bow tie. The shirts are below.

181
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,760
This.

182
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,820
- Why this? 
 - Because from this moment on, you need to live in the same time as me.

183
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,800

Unlike someone, I am young. Unlike someone.

203
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,200
- What? 
 - Hey, Ajeossi!

204
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,210
Ajeossi?

205
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,930

You know how to drive, don't you?

215
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,160
Yes.

216
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,100
What are you doing, not getting in the car?

217
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,100
Have you come? Let me escort you this way.

218
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,730
- Hello, Judge. 
 - Hello, Judge.

219
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,560
- He is really cool. 
 - Hello.

220
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,950
- He is so cool. 
 - Hello.

221
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,190
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

222
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh, Judge?

223
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,470
Excuse me.

224
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,900
This is the first time I've met you.

225
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,340
I am Jeong Seon Ah, who serves Chairman Seo Jeong Hak of the Social Responsibility Foundation.

226
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,230
Nice to meet you. I am Kim Ga On.

227
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,560
Yes.

228
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,850
Oh goodness.

229
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,700
- Judge, you could be an actor. 
 - Thank you.

230
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,980
You should make your debut. Our broadcast station will take care of you.

231
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,160
You're frightening him.

232
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,630
Our station is airing the Live Court Show, you know?

233
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,520
Ah, yes.

234
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,440
Her husband is Chairman Park Du Man of Sarang Media Group.

235
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,660
And her husband is Chairman Min Yong Sik of Minbo Group.

236
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,830
- Sam Se Pin. 
 - Pi Ang Mi. 
 - I am Kim Ga On.

237
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,060
You are quite a star these days.

238
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,510
- How about a selfie with us? 
 - Good, good.

239
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,440
- Let's take some pictures together. 
 - What's going on?

240
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,550
Goddesses, let's pose? Finger hearts?

241
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,810
Okay. Heart?

242
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,520
Okay.

243
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,680
If you do your hair so your forehead shows more, wouldn't it look better?

244
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,450
No, his face already looks good. Actually, his clothes...

245
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,590
- Yes, they're old-fashioned. What label is this? 
 - Yes, like a grandpa's clothes. Take it off.

246
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,750
- Hold on, what label is this? 
 - Take it off for a moment.

247
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,210
Just take it off. It's just for a moment.

248
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,610
Please excuse us for a moment.

249
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,340
He has a lot of people to greet today, so let me borrow him for a moment.

250
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,140
Yes.

251
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,770
Bye.

252
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,750
He is totally a kid, huh?

253
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,370
I wonder if he will survive under Kang Yo Han?

254
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,690
He is cute.

255
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,750
He looks good, right?

256
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,500
So his guardian showed up, huh?

257
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,310
I don't need a guardian.

258
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,710
But you were like a fawn caught by a pack of lionesses.

259
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,080
- Why are you calling me a fawn— 
 - Have you come?

260
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,700
Oh, who is this? My eyes are blinded by the light. Judge Kang.

261
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,720
Come sit here.

262
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,880
Our broadcast station manages to make money these days thanks to the flower-boy judges.

263
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,690
I am Park Du Man.

264
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,880
It seems your ad sales are going well these days?

265
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,270
Yes, indeed. They should, so I can make bigger donations, right?

266
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,430
So vulgar.

267
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,620
This man grumbling at me right now ...

268
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,850
There is this little shop called Minbo Group,

269
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,100
so he is Chairman Min Yong Sik of that place.

270
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,890
I am Kim Ga On.

271
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,390
Yes, Judge Kim, you are quite famous these days.

272
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,950
You should attend our study group meetings.

273
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,350
Study group ...

274
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,620
It's a gathering for those concerned about our nation.

275
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,380
People interested in finances, politics, and academia get together and study the flow of the world,

276
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,500
host great scholars and listen to their lectures...

277
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,290
Yes, that's what we do to entertain ourselves.

278
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:25,890
An ignorant merchant like myself ends up getting brain cramps.

279
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,300
Our Chairman Park knows he is ignorant? How clever he is.

280
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,320
Huh? Mr. President!

281
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,400
Is he joking?

282
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,240
Let's go.

283
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,400
I'd better go that way, too.

284
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,820
We will now introduce the glorious donors who participated in the Dream Village Project.

285
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,310
First, those who gave 100 million won (≈$87,000)

286
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,350
and those who gave 1 billion won (≈$873,000), will you please rise?

287
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,950
And next, it's such a great love, isn't it?

288
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,570
There is someone who gave 10 billion won. (≈$8.7 million) Where is he?

289
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,180
Please give him a huge hand.

290
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,810
Everyone, I now introduce Chairman Seo Jeong Hak.

291
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,350
"In!"

292
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:20,910
The power to overcome a national crisis is only this one character, "in," which means "virtuous."

293
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,730
It's a quality that should exist in every human being.

294
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,550
It is the foremost enemy against trouble, as stated in the Gongsonchu chapter of Mencius' writings.

295
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,550
Compassion.

296
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,360
If you don't have a compassionate heart,

297
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,090
then you are not a human being!

298
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:44,000
That heart is the fundamental principle of our foundation.

299
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,510
You must not forget!

300
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,860
Ah really, he is good.

301
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,050
 I like this.  Eat grapes. 

302
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,500
- Chairman— 
 - I don't know.

303
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,370
Here he comes.

304
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,800
That was great.

305
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,780
Sir, your words really moved me again.

306
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,090
Speaking of compassion is so appropriate.

307
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,560
We must have compassion for our citizens for our nation to prosper, mustn't we?

308
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,280
With that spirit, I will give my body and soul for the Dream Village Project,

309
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,970
and push, push, push! I will support you like that.

310
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,940
- Thank you, Mr. President. 
 - Don't mention it.

311
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,920
Mr. President, you seem like a different person today.

312
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,340
Why?

313
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,670
Whether sleeping, awake, sitting or standing,

314
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:03,450
all I do is worry about our nation for the sake of the citizens whom I love and respect.

315
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,880
Let's eat before worrying about our nation.

316
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,300
Give us food now!

317
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,140
Thank you.

318
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,100
Thank you.

319
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,700
Let's eat.

320
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,630
- Oh... 
 - I am sorry.

321
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,100
Please take your time.

322
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,400
You can take your time, it's all right.

323
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,440
Slowly... slowly...

324
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,310
Chairman?

325
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,660
What?

326
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,040
I'm sorry but there is an urgent communication.

327
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,110
Is that so? Please excuse  my discourtesy.

328
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,430
Please eat.

329
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,110
So, My Lady, about that—

330
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,260
Ow, damn.

331
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,490
I've committed a sin punishable by death.

332
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,030
This old body of mine is still committing sins.

333
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,290
Old man.

334
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,810
Ah, yes.

335
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,390
Can't you behave with decorum for even one damned hour?

336
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,790
- What do I do with you, really? 
 - I'm sorry.

337
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,770
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

338
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,490
Repent.

339
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:49,100
Repent. Repent! Repent! Repent!

340
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,420
Who are you?

341
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,720
I am a son of a b**ch.

342
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,570
Ah, how can you say that?

343
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,880
You are an activist for the poor who was even nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

344
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,720
No, I am just a dog.

345
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,070
Why feign modesty when you are the great philosopher and Elder Statesman?

346
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,660
No, no. I've deceived the world my entire life.

347
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,770
I am nothing but dog-trash who only satisfied my dirty carnal desires.

348
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:19,900
Look here. Aren't you the hidden influence that even the president can't ignore?

349
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,460
I am someone who befouled the powerless women while hiding behind my hollow name...

350
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,390
I am sorry.

351
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,110
I am sorry. Please kill me.

352
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,440
Old man.

353
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,050
Yes?

354
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,790
There is something you are mistaken about.

355
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,180
If a dog bites a person,

356
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:07,650
does that person become dirty?

357
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,890
A mere dog? Does he dare? huh?

358
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,140
You are correct. That's right.

359
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,560
Let's repent.

360
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,860
Let's do it for about a month this time.

361
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,610
I'll say it's another fasting prayer for the sake of the nation.

362
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,300
Yes.

363
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,180
Did that hurt?

364
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,280
Judge Kang, you run a trial in such a refreshing way.

365
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,460
All we can do is just be deeply moved by it.

366
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,420
You've made it so big, even after enduring such a big tragedy ten years ago.

367
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,010
Oh, don't mention it. It's thanks to all of you.

368
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,220
Yes. My heart hurts whenever I see Judge Kang.

369
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,270
We especially feel that way, really.

370
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,710
Of course, not me. But people around me, after this trial,

371
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,290
are quite worried.

372
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,100
Public sentiment is already turbulent, so must you, really...

373
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,140
make such a fuss over something so small?

374
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,280
We know Yeong Min well because he used to be a classmate of our child.

375
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,250
He was so cute and kind when he was young. So it's unfortunate.

376
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,330
I'm sorry, but for a trial in progress, we cannot speak—

377
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,490
So we're interfering with the independence of the judiciary, right?

378
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,370
Shouldn't we first worry about the nation, which is in such a mess right now?

379
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,180
The board of directors of the foundation have many complaints.

380
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,970
"Is Live Court Show really operating according to its original principles?"

381
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,040
"If something happens due to constant agitation of the citizens

382
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,500
will Judge Kang Yo Han take responsibility?"

383
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Look here! What are you saying right now—

384
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,340
That boy isn't potty-trained yet, is he?

385
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,670
Does it have to be Cha Gyeong Hui?

386
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,600
What are you saying... ?

387
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,790
You all know this well, don't you?

388
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,100
Cha Gyeong Hui has many enemies and many flaws.

389
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:36,750
So does it have to be Cha Gyeong Hui who protects your assets?

390
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,640
Honey.

391
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,550
Wait. I can't stop laughing.

392
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,280
Wow, Judge Kang, you are really powerful. I can't win over you.

393
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,640
You are such a inventive psycho.

394
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
A very creative crazy bastard.

395
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,690
And you are right, it doesn't have to be Cha Gyeong Hui.

396
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,630
The president for the next term. Isn't that right?

397
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,770
Someone popular with the people with a solid backstory.

398
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,690
Someone like that works during these times.

399
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,900
That's how even someone like me became president, isn't it?

400
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,860
Speaking as a merchant, it's better to bet on the surviving bastard.

401
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,280
Although I don't know who will be the survivor.

402
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,130
Surviving bastard?

403
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:41,930
Chairman Park, if you say it like that, are you the bastard who makes the bastard who is listening feel bad, Huh?

404
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,010
"If it's not me, it will work? No, no, no."

405
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,500
You can be a member of a rap band, huh?

406
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,780
Wow, what is this?

407
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,040
It's me here.  It's the real me.

408
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,820
Looks like you're not feeling well.

409
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,300
Director Jeong.

410
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,030
Don't you find Judge Kang unfamiliar tonight?

411
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,700
I'm not sure what you mean.

412
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:25,500
I just run errands for the chairman, but I can't help but see and hear a few things.

413
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,140
Because he is so different from the image that is known to the outside world...

414
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,540
Is there something you can tell me?

415
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,430
I guarantee confidentiality.

416
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,760
- You know about the fire in the Catholic church ten years ago, don't you? 
 - I do.

417
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,150
This was not reported in the media, but there, on that day,

418
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:59,130
a ceremony was in progress, to celebrate Judge Kang's older brother pledging all his assets to our foundation.

419
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,120
Kang Isaac?

420
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,730
And of all times, there was a big fire that day.

421
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,490
It was an old building, so it completely collapsed and people were buried.

422
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,660
Both Kang Isaac and his wife passed away that day.

423
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,310
But Judge Kang was miraculously found alive,

424
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,070
and the first thing he did after being released from the hospital...

425
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,050
What was it?

426
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,670
He withdrew the donation agreement that his brother had agreed to.

427
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,010
Claiming his brother was of unsound mind and did not have the mental capacity to agree to this.

428
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,840
He even submitted a medical evaluation report about this

429
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,010
Is this something a normal person can do?

430
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,510
Immediately after his brother and sister-in-law died in such a tragic way?

431
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,350
I keep thinking about this every time I watch Live Court Show

432
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,400
and I feel a bit stunned.

433
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,170
What's with your expression?

434
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,670
Did you go deaf, too?

435
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,240
What are you doing right now?!

436
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,050
So you should have answered me.

437
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,190
Why? Disappointed, after seeing the true image of this world?

438
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,960
The true image of rich people, anyway.

439
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,070
Do you think poor people are any different?

440
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,880
Human beings are equal...

441
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,550
... when faced with temptation.

442
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:57,910
 The prosecutors have yet to modify the indictment of Lee Yeong Min's battery case. 

443
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,480
 Public criticism is rising towards the Live Court Show which has been emphasizing fairness,  

444
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,450
 suspecting it of preferential treatment for the son of the current Minister of Justice. 

445
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,110
 Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui has not made any statements... 

446
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,380
- Turn it off. 
  - What their position will be in the near future... 

447
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,430
Punish him! Punish him!

448
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,430
The minister of Justice should resign! 
  Equality Before the Law 

449
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,510
Resign! Resign!

450
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,470
Punish Lee Yeong Min!

451
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,500
Punish him! Punish him!

452
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,420
The minister of Justice should resign!

453
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,450
Resign! Resign!

454
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,210
Punish Lee Yeong Min!

455
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,480
Resign! Resign!

456
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,280
Resign!

457
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,510
The minister of Justice should step down!

458
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,570
The minister of Justice should step down!

459
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,080
Step down!

460
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,170
Step down! Let me go!

461
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,280
The minister of Justice should step down! Let me go!

462
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,740
Crazy bastards.

463
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,520
What?

464
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,110
I understand.

465
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,290
What did the foundation say?

466
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:45,930
These snakes. The vibe is that they are leaving me on my own.

467
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,740
That is a disaster, Minister.

468
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,530
 My condition is this. Confess the truth of that case to the media. 

469
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:57,570
 If you do that, I will release your son. 

470
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,470
What did Kang Yo Han ask of you?

471
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,140
He wants something, seeing how he met with you.

472
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,510
I would be fine with selling our entire company and handing it over to him.

473
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,560
Let's protect Yeong Min.

474
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,130
It is our responsibility that he turned out that way.

475
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,660
We were always out and left him alone since he was young.

476
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,360
We didn't even know how much he was suffering.

477
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,660
Do you remember the day he took drugs? Saying he just wants to die.

478
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,690
Why bring that up again?

479
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,790
I really don't even want to think about that.

480
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,050
Honey! Money and status are not important, are they?

481
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,680
Let's protect our child.

482
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,140
He wouldn't be able to endure a single day in prison.

483
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,070
Oh, our beloved son.

484
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,010
Yes, what is more important than our child?

485
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,980
Honey, I will save Yeong Min.

486
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,650
Even if I have to sacrifice myself.

487
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,440
The trial is tomorrow already.

488
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,700
- I'm sure it will be fine, right? 
 - Huh?

489
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,010
What? What?

490
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,110
There is an urgent press conference by Minister Cha Gyeong Hui.

491
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,790
What?

492
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,940
 My fellow citizens. 

493
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,130
 I am standing here today with a heart full of bottomless regret. 

494
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:45,260
 For having caused concern to all of you due to the negligence of my foolish child, 

495
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,880
I am deeply sorry.

496
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,130
It is due to my wrongdoing and negligence for not having taught my child well.

497
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,130
The prosecutors

498
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:18,010
submitted a request to amend the indictment of Lee Yeong Min today.

499
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,620
The criminal charge was changed to habitual assault

500
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:24,220
to which were added other crimes which were subsequently discovered.

501
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,150
- What? What is she saying? 
 -  We will await the strict sentencing by the court. 

502
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,100
M... Mom.

503
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,670
 - We will not dare to ask for forgiveness.  
 - Wow.

504
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,850
Did political ambition win over maternal love?

505
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,560
Dad... this isn't right, is it?

506
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,900
This is different from what she told me.

507
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,810
- Yeong Min... 
 - This isn't right. What is this?

508
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,350
Yeong Min, calm down. Yeong Min?

509
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:52,140
Why? Why? Why? Your head hurts?

510
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,460
Medicine, medicine...

511
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,640
Here, take your medicine.

512
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,600
 Those who have committed crimes, whoever they are! 

513
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,310
Breathe.

514
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:06,690
 My conviction that they must receive punishment befitting the crime has not changed. 

515
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,620
 That is the Republic of Korea that I dream of! 

516
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,660
After everything I did to come this far...

517
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,160
There is no glory without sacrifice.

518
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,380
Yes, Su Hyeon.

519
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,050
The defendant acknowledges all his wrongdoings and is deeply repenting.

520
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:12,330
However, please consider that the defendant has extenuating circumstances.

521
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,460
What extenuating circumstances, Attorney?

522
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,530
Defendant was very sensitive and prone to loneliness since he was young.

523
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:22,710
And shouldn't all children at this age receive plentiful love from their parents as they grow?

524
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,460
Of course. Don't all children need that?

525
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,720
That is right. But unfortunately, the defendant

526
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,570
had to share his parents with our society.

527
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,880
His mother was a public servant and his father was a pillar of industry.

528
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,450
They served our nation, so they could not be with the defendant.

529
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,110
Goodness. What difficulties he faced.

530
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,450
Judge Kang.

531
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:51,110
Your Honor? This is all due to the negligence of his unworthy parents.

532
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,730
Please, I request mercy.

533
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,280
That's right. So in that large house,

534
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,800
the defendant grew up lonely, with only the housekeeper for company.

535
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,150
To be specific, they were two housekeepers, one chef, and one gardener. Not that it's important.

536
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,260
Ah, yes.

537
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,410
Besides, the defendant had to watch the housekeepers steal household items very often.

538
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:15,820
Isn't it natural for him to develop fear of poor people?

539
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,180
That is why the defendant developed obsessive and aggressive behavior.

540
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:25,230
I submit written opinions by prominent child psychologists and psychiatrists.

541
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,340
Please consider them.

542
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,880
It's hard, isn't it?

543
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,280
Hard? Detective work was a lot harder.

544
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,420
- You probably know better than I do, Detective Yu. 
 - Sure.

545
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,490
Why are you bringing up such an old incident?

546
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,130
- The court can't do much either. 
 - Sorry?

547
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,780
The Supreme Court is frantic. They want to find ways to promote our chief some more.

548
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,560
They're trying to strike the iron while it's hot.

549
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,080
I see that even there, the youngest is doing all the hard work.  In any case ...

550
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,910
It's true that being the survivor of a horrible fire makes for quite an appealing story.

551
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,830
It was at a cathedral?

552
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:27,270
Yes. It was apparently the church his father used to attend.

553
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,980
I looked into it, and it wasn't even a day when mass was being held.

554
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:36,150
I think there was a donation event happening? The list of attendees isn't even clear.

555
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,400
I'm not sure... What does this have to do with promoting him to the public?

556
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,360
We were just looking for a moving story we could use. It might end up in an interview, too.

557
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,560
By the way, I heard the cause of the fire was never found.

558
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:59,440
Yes. The cathedral had been converted from an old school building.

559
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,930
It was a wooden building and it all burned down,  nothing was left.

560
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,400
Maybe a curtain caught on fire because of a cigarette.

561
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,960
Or there could have been a short circuit.

562
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,220
You had taken Judge Kang Yo Han's testimony, right?

563
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,730
Did he say he saw anything, maybe?

564
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:21,510
Well, I did go see him at the hospital once, but he did not remember much.

565
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:26,570
Wouldn't anyone be the same? He had been buried under the collapsed roof and everything was a mess.

566
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:32,400
By the way, I heard that today is the trial broadcast. Let's watch it.

567
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,230
Here.

568
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,680
 Of course, this cannot justify all of the defendant's wrongdoings. 

569
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,200
But... aren't we all parents?

570
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,520
 Even if our child has a twisted attitude, is it right to isolate him from the rest of society? 

571
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,490
Yes, my son is still very young

572
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:56,340
and did that because of lack of experience in society.

573
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,770
This is a child who was not looked after by his parents.

574
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,720
You mean he was not raised with the whip of love?

575
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,430
That's right. There's a saying that it takes a village to raise a child.

576
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:11,260
Growing up, the defendant did not receive the love and discipline a parent should offer.

577
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,650
Can't we show broad-mindedness and embrace his deviations?

578
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,180
Oh my, Yeong Min!

579
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,220
My poor son! I'm sorry!

580
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,020
Let us imagine the defendant is sentenced to long-term imprisonment for this case.

581
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,040
If that isn't emotional populism, then what is it?

582
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,970
Indeed, prison is not free, after all.

583
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,590
That's right. It's all tax money.

584
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:42,170
For this case, wouldn't it be better to arrange for the victims to receive a satisfying financial compensation?

585
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,800
Speaking bluntly, even if we sent this man to prison,

586
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,700
would it benefit the victims? Would it put food on their table?

587
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,490
Isn't it hard for everyone to make a living?

588
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:56,110
What an impressive defense. Thank you, Attorney.

589
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:58,940
I apologize if I overstepped somewhat, Your Honor.

590
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,630
No worries.

591
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,620
That is sensible. That was a very logical defense. I sympathize with it.

592
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,290
What? How can he say that?

593
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,920
Hearing the attorney's argument,

594
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,490
I found the most reasonable punishment fitting this case.

595
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:19,070
It will neither burden the tax-paying citizens, nor isolate the defendant from society for an extended time.

596
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:23,020
It will only inflict the pain fitting to his wrongdoings, for a very short time.

597
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,460
It is the most effective and economical punishment.

598
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,240
- Flogging. 
 - What?

599
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,900
Flogging?

600
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,770
Wow! Wow!

601
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:40,640
Wow! This is great.

602
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,260
 As the attorney stated, the defendant lacked the love and discipline a parent should offer. 

603
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,070
 Our society will offer him the whip of love.  

604
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:50,690
You said that it takes a village to raise a child, didn't you?

605
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,140
Flogging? Hey, look up some materials about flogging and air them.

606
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,220
Yes.

607
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,160
This doesn't make sense!

608
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,000
How can you tie and beat someone up in the 21st century? This is too barbarous!

609
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,530
This is an insult to the many respectable countries that still use this punishment to this day.

610
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:12,370
Moreover, this finds its place in the special act on strengthening law and order

611
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:17,760
 promoted by the defendant's mother, Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui. Don't you agree? 

612
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,570
This crazy bastard!

613
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,040
Y-Your Honor.

614
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,130
I apologize. I apologize, Your Honor.

615
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,370
I apologize to all the victims.

616
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:37,670
I grew up wrongly. I-I apologize. Please spare me just this once.

617
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,500
I'm so sorry.

618
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,070
All right then, shall we ask the citizens' opinion? What do you all think?

619
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,670
Do you think this is an appropriate punishment for the defendant?

620
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,200
Your Honor...

621
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,400
 Punish Lee Yeong Min! 

622
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,430
 Punish him! Punish him! 

623
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,370
The Minister of Justice should step down!

624
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,890
 Business closure. Due to unavoidable circumstances, we will close at the end of the month.  

625
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,900
I voted.

626
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,300
Me too. It'll all work out, right?

627
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,950
 DIKE 
 What is your choice?  

628
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,610
 Flogging - In favor: 65% - Against: 35%  

629
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,730
Who do you all take yourselves for?

630
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:46,340
- Hey! Calm down! 
 - Let go!

631
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,740
Yeong Min...

632
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,600
What's so great about you guys?

633
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,540
What makes you think you're so much better?

634
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,450
What's different between  you and me? Are you all sinless?

635
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,640
Yeong Min!

636
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,850
This... Do you think this makes sense? Huh?

637
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:08,510
- Camera 1. Make sure to catch Lee Yeong Min. Follow him. 
  - Yes.  

638
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,640
- Camera 3. Bust shot on Lee Yeong Min's father. 
  - Got it. 

639
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,950
What makes me worse than you?

640
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:17,460
What did I do that is so wrong?

641
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,650
You're all the same. You. You. You.

642
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,740
What's so different between us?

643
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,230
Gosh, I can't believe him.

644
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,570
Who do you think you are to judge me?

645
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,080
I told you I'm sorry.

646
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:40,660
I told you I did wrong! I went that far I ...

647
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:46,310
Your Honor. I am getting on my knees and apologizing to you.

648
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,830
I was wrong, Your Honor. Please forgive me just once.

649
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:53,950
I am so sorry, Your Honor. Please forgive me. Please spare me, Your Honor.

650
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:59,650
I was wrong, so please forgive me just this once and let me go, I beg you.

651
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,510
I am really sorry.

652
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:05,090
Please forgive me, Your Honor.

653
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,080
Following the people's will,

654
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,730
the judges of this trial sentence the defendant

655
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:15,800
to flogging thirty times.

656
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,380
Your ...Your Honor.

657
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,590
Compared to the defendant's offenses,

658
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,440
this punishment can be considered more than humane enough.

659
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,430
As the punishment was decided in accordance with the will of the people,

660
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:31,510
it is only right that its execution will also be made public for the entire nation to watch, in a transparent manner.

661
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:35,300
Please note that the Ministry of Justice is in charge of executing the sentence.

662
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:47,400
 30 floggings 

663
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,780
As expected, he doesn't do things halfway. Brutes like that guy should be beaten up like mutts. 
  Sentence: 30 floggings 

664
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,020
A person like him should be the president!

665
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,870
So he can clean up trashy people!

666
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:05,400
Do you know that after his discharge from the hospital, Judge Kang cancelled the donation agreement

667
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,790
that his older brother had made?

668
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,820
- What nonsense are you saying? 
 - Ah...

669
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:16,790
It's nonsense? It could be the motive for a crime,

670
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,260
but it's nonsense?

671
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,040
What's wrong with you? Are you insane? You dare to slander him?

672
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,030
You'll get stoned if you keep this up.

673
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,860
Do you know how many people live to watch Judge Kang, in this hell of a world?

674
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:33,060
You should stop. Let's go.

675
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,610
Detective Park. How did you start this restaurant?

676
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,460
What do you mean how? I did it with my severance pay.

677
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:51,340
That's strange. From what I found, you had a lot of debt.

678
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:56,130
Gambling debts. You closed a case for 'cause unknown', and two months later you were suddenly resigning.

679
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:00,850
All your gambling debt gone, and you were able to open this restaurant in a prime area.

680
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:07,270
Your severance pay must have been astounding, Detective Park.

681
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,820
 Sentencing Order 

682
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:29,800
 Minister, I know it is difficult but you must sign the sentencing order. 

683
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,690
 If you back off now, 

684
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,650
That one, really ...

685
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,840
There .... There ...

686
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,260
Yeong Min!  Yeong Min!

687
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,060
D-Dad.

688
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,210
Wait a moment.

689
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,970
I will carry out the sentence.

690
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,740
Start.

691
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,680
Wait ... wait a sec.

692
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,980
  1 

693
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,050
Yeong Min!

694
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:52,000
♫  I stay up all night  ♫

695
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,380
♫  I stay up all night  ♫

696
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,340
Chairman. Chairman?  Chairman!

697
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,550
Chairman!

698
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:03,830
♫  I think about your eyes  ♫

699
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:10,530
♫  And when the light of dawn shines  ♫

700
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:14,230
♫  And when the light of dawn shines  ♫

701
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:21,450
♫  I shake off the gloom  ♫

702
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,500
♫  You said I'll live in the sunlight,  ♫

703
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:56,070
♫  In the sunlight,  ♫

704
00:59:56,070 --> 01:00:00,530
♫  In the silence  ♫

705
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:05,820
♫  In a warped place  ♫

706
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:11,030
♫  I was born and came here  ♫

707
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,360
♫  I met you at the time  ♫

708
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,880
- Well, shall we resume next week? 
 - Yes.

709
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,340
Let's resume again after he has undergone sufficient treatment.

710
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,640
Are you satisfied?

711
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,210
Is there some other reason to be dissatisfied?

712
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,430
What kind of cruelty is this?

713
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,520
Cruel?

714
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,550
I just carried out the will of the majority of the public.  Isn't that democracy?

715
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:04,450
Don't be a hypocrite.  You are just doing this because it's fun.

716
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,720
You are just a cold-blooded monster.

717
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:13,050
You hunt for fun and if there is an obstacle, you remove it.

718
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,450
Your hyeong* too. 
   (older brother)   

719
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:21,440
Is that also why you killed your hyeong?

720
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,690
Say it again.

721
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,220
Did you kill your hyeong too?

722
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,520
Say it again.

723
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,090
The hyeong who adored you so much ...

724
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:55,910
Say it again.  Say it again!

725
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:05,290
Cruel?  Cruel?!

726
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,520
Do you know what is really cruel?

727
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,550
 Verena Cathedral 

728
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:35,000
 After the person called my father died, 
   

729
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:39,050
 my hyeong said he would donate all of his money to the foundation. 

730
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,270
 As the foundation people acted as if they were impressed by Hyeong's donation, 

731
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:54,520
 they held a big party at the cathedral. 

732
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,050
  - You made a very difficult decision. 
 - Not at all, sir. 

733
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:00,470
 I admire you.  It wasn't easy. 

734
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:06,260
 Putting into practice the precepts of love and of sharing is so difficult and exhausting, isn't it? 

735
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,840
 Oh my, child!  You're Elijah, aren't you?  You're so adorable. 

736
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,190
 Hey, do you know how great a person your father is? 

737
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,960
 He is like a saint. 

738
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,930
-  What do you mean by saint? 
 - You are amazing. 

739
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:22,310
 Hey, is this a human or a fairy?  Why are you so pretty? 

740
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:25,430
 Hey, do you want to sign a contract with my company? 

741
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,090
 - Why are you doing this to her? 
 - Hey, hey, hey! 

742
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,150
 - Come back here! 
 - Don't run. 

743
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,030
 Hey! 

744
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,420
 Verena Cathedral 

745
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,830
  - Why did you come out? 
 - Let's go. 

746
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,990
 I will come in soon, so go in for now and stay with your dad, okay? 

747
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:48,230
 - Uncle should come in soon too. 
 - Yeah. 

748
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:52,220
 Hey! 

749
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,580
 Are you coming to sign the contract, little lady? 

750
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:59,700
 Upsy daisy.  You're so pretty. 

751
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:23,580
 How much is that? 

752
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:27,490
 I don't know. It's going to be tremendous. 

753
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,890
 Doing so many procedures... it's really extra-ordinary. 

754
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:34,560
 In two or three hours, tens of billions will come into the foundation. 

755
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,640
 Be a little patient. 

756
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,590
 Let's pray that Almighty God, the Father, is willing to accept this donation 

757
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:45,440
 dedicated to God from Kang Isaac, Isaac, and Yu Hui Jin, Cecilia. 

758
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,080
 Amen. 

759
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,350
  The body of Christ ...     
 - Have you seen Elijah?   

760
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:53,950
  The body of Christ ... 

761
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,780
  The body of Christ ... 

762
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:00,720
  The body of Christ ... 

763
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,860
  The body of Christ ... 

764
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:08,150
  The body of Christ ... 

765
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:13,930
  The body of Christ ... 

766
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:32,230
 Mom! 

767
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,410
 Honey! Honey! 

768
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,770
 Mom! 

769
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,560
 Elijah! Elijah! 

770
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:25,170
 Move! Move! 

771
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,520
 Mom. 

772
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,210
 That crazy bastard! 

773
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,160
 Mom! 

774
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,410
 Who are you? 

775
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,300
 Mom! 

776
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,990
 Mom! 

777
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:02,100
 Mom! 

778
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:26,950
 - Elijah! 
 - Mom! 

779
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:32,830
- Mom. 
 - Are you okay? It's all right.

780
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:35,460
 Let's go with Dad. 

781
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:43,630
 Move! Are you trying to die? 

782
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,660
 Yo Han. 

783
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,130
 Elijah. Elijah. 

784
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:27,470
 Yo Han. 

785
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,440
 Go. 

786
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,170
 Go! 

787
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,790
 I'll be back soon. 

788
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:46,590
 Hyeong. 

789
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,330
  Hyeong.  What... ? 

790
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,870
 What are you doing? 

791
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,400
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

792
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,310
 Hyeong. 

793
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:56,700
 A word, please. 

794
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,030
 A survivor is coming out. 

795
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,250
 Aigoo, what a terrible thing you've suffered. 

796
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:42,070
 Police 

797
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:53,600


798
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,660
 The Devil Judge 

799
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:17,450
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

800
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,160
Indeed, people

801
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:41,000
like these sort of stories.

802
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:48,890
♫  I don't know what my expression is  ♫

803
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:55,100
♫  in my memory of the past  ♫

804
01:15:55,100 --> 01:16:00,660
♫  Even though I tried to recall it,   ♫

805
01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:07,420
♫  I can't remember it at all  ♫

806
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:10,770
♫  I can't breathe  ♫

807
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:14,170
 A hunter thoroughly hides his own scent. 

808
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,910
 - Until the right day comes. 
 - It must be fun. 

809
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:21,460
 I feel no hesitation when it comes to getting rid of those who get in my way. 

810
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:24,170
 I'm giving Kang Yo Han some homework. 

811
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:27,840
 I'd better find out who is backing Cha Gyeong Hui. I will begin with a body blow. 

812
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,100
 Even though no one may understand how you feel, I do. 

813
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,300
 - That emotion. Rage. 
 - Make a choice. 

814
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:39,000
 Whether you will block my way, or whether you will stand by my side. 

815
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,150
♫  In the thick fog, I  ♫
