 Episode 3 

10
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,960
Were you looking for this?

11
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,100
You knew about this.

12
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,890
Why do you do things like this, anyway?

13
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,180
Why do I do things like this?

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,550
Yes.

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,840
Because I can.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,650
Possibility is like a drug.

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,720
Out of the way!

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,820
Did he die?

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,480
No.

21
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,550
Did you kill him?

22
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,580
I told you I didn't!

23
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,230
What's this? He's still alive.

24
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,480
How boring.

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,330
What's so boring about this?

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,950
Where is this place?

27
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,820
It's not heaven.

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,600
I wouldn't push myself if I were you.

 Do Not Enter - Police Line - Under Investigation 

32
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,430
The terrorist explosion at the judge's chambers has shocked the nation.

33
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,760
Everyone is focused on Judge Kang Yo Han's personal safety.

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,140
The case has been handed over to the police and the investigation is in full swing.

35
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,350
They secured the CCTV footage from inside the supreme court and the entry and exit list.

36
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,120
- It's Kang Yo Han! 
 - I-it's Kang Yo Han.

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,190
He is coming out.

38
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,480
It's Kang Yo Han!

39
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,220
Is he there? He is over there!

40
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,190
He's coming out. He's coming out.

41
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,540
Judge Kang, are your injuries severe?

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,860
- What is your current condition? 
 - Is your body all right?

43
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,110
Is Judge Kang all right?

44
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,410
I'm fine, thanks to the concern of the people.

45
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,780
And your injuries aren't severe?

46
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,210
It's tolerable.

47
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,500
Whose doing is this?

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,950
We are not sure yet.

49
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,600
Do you think this terrorist act was done by people in power who are displeased with the live court show?

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
That's possible.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Will you suspend the trial for now?

52
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,360
I have something to tell the people.

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,110
It seems I terrified someone.

54
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,830
The nation's judge cannot stop due to cowardly terrorist acts such as this one.

55
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,530
The trial will proceed as originally planned.

56
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,180
Then what kind of case will the next trial tackle?

57
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,470
It's about a son of the privileged class, who repeatedly abuses power and is violent against the weak.

58
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,970
The defendant is Lee Yeong Min, vice president of Jungwon F&amp;B.

59
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,270
Lee Yeong Min?

60
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,730
If it is Vice-President Lee Yeong Min, could he be the son of Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui?

61
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,620
- What the hell is he saying? 
 - Yes, that is correct.

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,570
If you bring the current minister's son to court, will the prosecution do nothing?

63
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,680
All citizens are equal under the law.

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,450
This man is no different from any other defendant to me.

65
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,190
Kang Yo Han, you bastard.

66
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,430
♫  There's a drought in my mind 
 My thoughts are drowning me all right  ♫

67
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,840
♫  Completely blind (Completely blind)  ♫

68
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,980
♫  Does that change my mind?  ♫

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,370
Still, you must have faced various kinds of opposition to this.

70
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,190
The mutt can bark all it wants. The train will continue.

71
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,140
Mutt?

72
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,720
 Judge, you're so cool! 

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,360
 You're amazing! 

74
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,650
 Wow! ♫  And drink the rest  ♫

75
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,250
♫  From drought to flood, 
 so obscene  ♫

76
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,100
♫   that's my very own inner over greed  ♫

77
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,790
Yeong Min...

78
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,280
Minister. Minister!

79
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,960
Let's have a look.

80
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,810
I'm from the police.

81
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,370
Sir Judge!

82
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,660
Is Judge Kim Ga On safe?

83
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,960
Who are you?

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,260
I'm the inspector who's been assigned to this case. My name is Yun Su Hyeon.

85
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,470
I see. I wish you luck.

86
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,000
Is Judge Kim safe?

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
Yes, he's safe.

88
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,930
Are you personally acquainted with Judge Kim? Maybe... his girlfriend?

89
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,570
No. I'm his friend.

90
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,120
I did not expect Judge Kim to have a detective friend.

91
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,680
Where is Ga On right now?

92
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,870
I'm sorry, but I cannot tell you that.

93
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,330
- I'm sorry? 
 - Right now his safety comes first.

94
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,510
There may be a followup attack, so it's best he completes his treatment at a safe location.

95
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,920
So where is that? Let me see him.

96
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,130
Policewoman Yun Su Hyeon.

97
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,890
Forgive me, Judge.

98
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,150
Just find the criminal. Leave Judge Kim to me.

99
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,170
Who are you?

100
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,150
Why are you so startled?

102
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,830
Did Young Master Yo Han not tell you anything?

103
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,460
Tell me what?

104
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,280
Then I have nothing further to say to you.

105
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,480
I will bring you another tray of food.

106
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,900
"Young Master"...

107
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,400
All rich folks are alike.

108
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,210
This looks ancient. I wonder how much it costs?

109
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,110
- That's a national treasure. 
 - What?

110
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,420
I'm kidding. What an idiot.

111
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,430
Stop poking your nose where it doesn't belong and stay in your bed like a good little boy.

112
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,180
Well, who are you, and why are you speaking casually to me?

113
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,610
Elijah.

114
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,820
Eli?  Is that your name?

115
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,390
It's Elijah., you dolt. Have you never read the Bible before? 
  (Elijah was an Old Testament prophet) 

116
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,310
Fine Elijah. Elijah..

117
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,980
But have I done anything wrong to you?

118
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,910
- Your face. 
 - Say what?

119
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,500
Your face annoys me.

120
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,930
How dare...

121
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,940
"How dare"? What's wrong with my face—?

122
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,190
Why did Yo Han pick up trash like this? A total knockoff.

123
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,950
Wait. Wait!

124
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,260
What's going on with this house?

125
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,610
Ah, Dad, what am I supposed to do?

126
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,780
What did I do wrong to be sent to the people's court? That crazy bastard!

127
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,100
I know. He's a crazy fool. What kind of judge is he anyway?

128
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,360
Don't worry, Yeong Min. Your mother will make sure nothing bad happens to  you.

129
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,700
How dare anyone touch our boy.

130
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,240
- Dad, there is something I haven't told you yet. 
 - Yeah?

131
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,030
That bastard Kang Yo Han... I think he's deliberately targeting me.

132
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,420
What are you talking about?

133
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,380
Ah... so what I'm trying to say is...

134
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,100
Hey, Yeong Min.

135
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,850
Yeong Min.

136
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,010
Oh, honey.

137
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,250
Mom.

138
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,840
Are you going to disappoint me like this? Huh?!

139
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm sorry, Mother.

140
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,900
Look me square in the eyes. Right now, huh?

141
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Look at me. Right now. Look at me!

142
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,130
Don't worry. Nothing is going to happen. Nothing at all.

143
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,080
Do you understand?!

144
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,920
Hey, Honey. Are you sure everything will be all right?

145
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,690
And what have you been doing all this time, letting our kid get to this state?

146
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,440
I mean, I did try to resolve everything without any issues,

147
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,100
but it's just this one thing...  that complicated my efforts.

148
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,850
That won't be a problem, right?

149
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,690
Don't worry.

150
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,970
That trial will never proceed.

151
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,610
Are you going to leave him alone?

152
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,730
Oh, you're here.

153
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,730
You're here, Minister.

154
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,320
By the way, what do you mean by if I'm going to leave him alone? Who is "him"?

155
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,140
- I'm going to take my leave. 
 - Already?

156
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,400
I don't think it is appropriate for my position

157
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,110
to be meeting with a family member of a defendant.

158
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,350
I don't have any personal feelings on the matter, Minister.

159
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,510
Public affairs are public, private affairs are private.

160
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,400
I won't have any personal feelings either,

161
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,450
no matter what I may do in the future.

162
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,690
Judge Kang?

163
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,220
Director Jeong.  Are you here to convey some message from the foundation?

164
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,420
When it comes to conveying messages,  there are many, all over the place.

165
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,760
By the way, are you all right?  Weren't you injured?

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,100
- This terrorist attack was strange. 
 - What?

167
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,510
It wasn't enough to go off and kill someone,

168
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,000
but blew up subtly, just enough so that you wouldn't ignore it.

169
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,120
As a warning to someone.

170
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,530
Oh my.  That's really odd.

171
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,140
Perhaps my imagination is excessive.

172
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,640
In any case, there are people in the world who understand a warning easily,

173
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,750
and there are those who don't understand, only to regret it later.

174
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,050
- That's what I think, Judge. 
 - I agree.

175
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,530
There are indeed people who don't understand warnings, in this world.

176
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,960
The foundation sponsors are very worried.

177
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,930
When we're just about to announce the building of the Dream Village project, his pointless behavior might irritate the working class.

178
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,640
I'm sorry, Minister.

179
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,120
People are very sensitive to so-called power-tripping. Public opinion, you know.

180
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,640
That's why you should have clamped down on him, at such a sensitive time.

181
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,750
Is the young man always unable to control his emotions? Does his mood usually swing so wildly?

182
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,270
Is it because his mother is too powerful? So that when he is under too much stress, he over—

183
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,420
I was going to talk to you about this, Minister Cha,

184
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,080
but your gaze is too intense.  Too intense.

185
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,710
Honestly, it's not good for a woman to have a too intense gaze.

186
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,700
You are really going too far with your words.

187
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,570
First of all, how about switching this live court to a different case—

188
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,600
There was over a million people.

189
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:34,300
They signed a national petition  asking we find out who attacked "our" Judge Kang Yo Han.

190
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,260
Isn't that frightening? In just one day, just one day, a million people signed.

191
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,570
The atmosphere is such

192
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,840
that you could cause a real riot if you rub Kang Yo Han the wrong way.

193
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,490
I understand.

194
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,610
If it's a burden on the administration level, I will take care of it.

195
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,090
What do you think you're doing?

196
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,390
What do you think I'm doing?

197
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,030
I will do it.

198
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm not doing it because I want to.  Be still.

199
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,500
- I can do it. 
 -  I said stay still.

200
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,990
Can you sit up?

201
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,030
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

202
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,860
Who was that lady earlier?

203
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,720
Who? Nanny?

204
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,050
- She got off from work. 
 - Nanny?

205
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,930
What is this?

206
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,610
It happened when I was young and childish.

207
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,870
That's unexpected.

208
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,510
-   Are you an old fogey? 
 - What?

209
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,960
It's typical of old fogeys  to judge others as they please.

210
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,010
That really hurt!

211
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,800
It's typical of the younger generation to be crybabies.

212
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,830
What? Crybaby?

213
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,530
 Hello, my fellow citizens. 

214
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,750
 This is Judge Oh Jin Ju of the People's Court. 

215
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,980
  I'm sure the people of this country are very worried 

216
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,150
 because of the recent terrorist attack at the Supreme Courthouse. 

217
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,000
 However our Judge Kang Yo Han will never yield to such intimidation. 

218
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,400
 As you all are aware, our Judge Kang is a very strong person. 

219
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,880
 So I hope everyone will show lots of support 

220
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,100
to Judge Kang and Judge Kim Ga On —

221
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,190
What is this woman?

222
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,110
- Judge Oh. She's a judge I work with. 
 - Are you dating her?

223
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,910
- What are you talking about? They're my associate judges, so —

224
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,930
- Are you dating her? 
  - I said no. Huh?

225
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,020
She's just over-reacting, to the point of tears.

226
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,370
- Aren't you dating? 
 - No.

227
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,450
- Are you really not dating? 
 - No.

228
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,790
So boring.

229
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,730
Why did you bring that thing in the bedroom?

230
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,070
Who? Ga On?

231
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,390
Even his name sounds terrible.

232
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,020
Get rid of him soon.

233
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,360
Why? Does he bother you?

234
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,650
If you don't get rid of him soon, I'll kill him.

235
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,600
With those legs? You said that once you could walk, you'd kill me first.

236
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,390
Do one thing at a time, step by step, hmm?

237
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,000
Aren't you going to follow her? Hmm?

238
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,860
Stay still. Don't roam around.

239
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,590
Is there something a stranger shouldn't see?

240
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,150
It's not good to be too nosey.

241
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,650
Well, I'm fine now, so I should go home.

242
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,570
You're safe here. We haven't caught the terrorist yet.

243
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,380
What are you planning to do about the trial?

244
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm bringing a  sub-judge to replace you.  Don't worry.

245
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,690
"Sub-Judge"?

246
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,570
Judge Jeong In Seok will be a substitute for Judge Kim until he recovers.

247
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,430
Nice to meet you, respected Judge Oh.

248
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,820
Wow, he is the very image of a judge.

249
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,600
- Pardon? 
  - It's nothing.

250
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,030
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Ah, yes.

251
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,990
Thank you for being brave enough to help out in this critical situation.

252
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,760
Not at all.   It's an honor to become a part of the live court.

253
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,320
I will do my best.

254
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,790
I'm sure you will. Then.

255
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,150
- Let's work hard. 
 - Pardon?

256
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,020
- Work hard.
 - Oh.

257
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh, hold on.  That's Judge Kim's desk.

258
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,620
Then where should I go?

259
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,880
You can sit there.

260
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,820
Oh, yes.

261
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,310
It won't be long until the live broadcast. Let's get to work.

262
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,030
Yes.

263
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,470
Young Master Yo Han told you to stay in your sickbed.

264
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,560
I was so bored I couldn't stand it anymore.

265
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm not Sleeping Beauty.

266
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,690
I can put you to sleep continuously if you want,

267
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,850
like Sleeping Beauty.

268
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,560
- What did you say? 
 - Just kidding.

269
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,130
What kind of joke is this brutal?

270
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,460
No one in this house listens to people.

271
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,260
 Supreme Court Control Center 

272
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,200
We looked everywhere but there were no outsiders.

273
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,190
Ah you're persistent, Detective.

274
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,260
I don't see any outsiders, no matter how much I look.

275
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,570
Could the culprit be from the inside?

276
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,440
From the inside?

277
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,090
Could be.

278
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,020
Right? Judge Kang Yo Han must be having too much success.

279
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,340
There might be a judge hiding a grudge.

280
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,350
The bomb went off from the wall with the painting.

281
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,250
That's right.

282
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,720
What if it weren't that someone came and installed the bomb,

283
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,290
but it had been installed inside the painting from the beginning.

284
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,490
From the beginning?

285
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,510
What's the phone number of the company in charge of interior design for the Live Court Show?

286
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,520
Detective Yun Su Hyeon seems to have found a lead.

287
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,810
Don't lose her. You know that, right?

288
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,470
We have to find them before the police do.

289
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,650
Can you give us a moment to talk?

290
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,750
Excuse me.

291
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,960
Oh my god...!

292
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,250
Remove your hand.

293
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,480
Where are you from?

294
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,880
From the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

295
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,510
Is it true you delivered all

296
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,950
the internal furnishings of the Live Court Show?

297
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,720
Who knows...

298
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,980
Let's start with the transaction books. Is the office over there?

299
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,690
Show me the warrant first.

300
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,890
Aigoo... you must have been very busy.

301
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,140
Take care of the things you need first and come back.

302
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,490
I will be waiting.

303
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,390
You must be in a good mood?

304
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,970
What is this, shit.

305
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,720
This is a fun place.

306
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,410
Do furniture factories handle small bombs like this these days?

307
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,510
This shit.

308
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,910
I almost really died.

309
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,770
You bastard, want to die?

310
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,640
Spare me, I'll tell you everything.

311
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,760
What can I do? I don't have any questions for you.

312
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,550
I'll talk, I'll tell you everything.

313
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,620
Ah.. You talk too much.

314
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,940
Spare me, I'll tell you everything.

315
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,560
The Foundation... someone from the Foundation ordered me to.

316
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,760
They said to just scare you a little.

317
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,100
Dog.

318
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,180
You should stop now.

319
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,510
Judge.

320
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,770
Go tell your owner

321
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,700
that he should come talk to me directly.

322
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,330
Is this because of Judge Kim Ga On?

323
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,870
It seems you behaved.

324
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,300
A present, for behaving.

325
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,840
You're hurt.

326
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,720
It's nothing.

327
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,570
Are the preparations for the Lee Yeong Min trial going well?

328
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,150
Prepare for what?  It's a simple case.

329
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,050
I understand that you're the kind of person who prepares thoroughly for the cases, in various ways.

330
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,700
Really?

331
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,360
I have no idea what you're talking about.

332
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,760
You said there's no such thing as justice in reality, right?

333
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,090
It's all just a horribly unfair game.

334
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,790
So what?

335
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,120
What's the reason ...

336
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,770
you decided to join this horribly unfair game?

337
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,710
The reason?

338
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,920
Do I need to have a reason?

339
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,630
Is there something you want to set right? Or is there something you regret?

340
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,360
- Are you an old fogey? 
 - Pardon?

341
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,770
You said it's typical of old fogeys to judge others as they please.

342
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,020
- That's not what I meant— 
 - Just focus on recovering.

343
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,720
And enough with your annoying complaints.

344
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,520
 Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency - Request for search and seizure warrant 
 Name: Kim Man Ho 

345
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,120
Oh Ga On!

346
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,680
My ears are still fine, you know?

347
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,580
Do you think that's important—?

348
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,010
 Are you all right? What about your injuries? Are your limbs okay? 

349
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,850
Am I supposed to have two arms and two legs?

350
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,280
 You must have had a blow to your head. Is your face all right? 

351
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,880
With your crappy personality, your only redeeming feature is your face.

352
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,920
 - Hey, Su Hyeon.  
 - Yeah?

353
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,090
 I'm fine. I bet you were very worried. 

354
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,100
Su Hyeon, are you okay?

355
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,370
Where are you right now?

356
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,700
- Kang Yo Han's house. 
 - What?!

357
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,430
What convinced you to trust that bastard and be there?

358
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,440
Well, at least it looks safe here. He has all manner of security systems in place.

359
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,260
Hey, the home owner is the most dangerous of them all. What dog crap are you spouting?

360
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,620
 The explosion could be his doing as well. 

361
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,430
That's true.

362
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,090
 He did try to scare me to not wander around without permission. 

363
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,420
Get out of there right now.

364
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,550
I'm already in the tiger's den. I might as well try to dig up some dirt.

365
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,590
 There's too little that we know about him. 

366
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,650
 His family history, background, personal upbringing, and the like. 

367
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,000
Listen, Ga On. I'll look into all of that. Leave that to me.

368
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,300
 - So don't you do anything else, all right?  
 - There you go again, mothering me, Yun Su Hyeon.

369
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,550
That's not what I meant—

370
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,820
Anyway, it must be due to the shock, I've been sleepy all day.

371
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,020
But I can't sleep all day, can I?

372
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,520
 I'll be careful, so don't worry. 

373
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,300
 How long will you leave our neighbors on the streets?    
  

374
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,640
 

375
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,870
 In order for South Korea to rise again, it must first  

376
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,400
 shine a light on the lowest place. 

377
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,400
 Our Social Responsibility Foundation is building a dream village,  
  

378
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,000
 of 30,000 housing units for the sick and the weary 

379
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,380
 on the outskirts of Seoul.  
  

380
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,700
 It is a rehabilitation community that provides free medical care 

381
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,570
 and free housing. 

382
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,970
 If we all work together,  
  

383
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,500
 this beautiful dream will become reality.  
  

384
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,350
 Thank you.  
 

385
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,820
It looks perfect, don't you think?

386
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,840
- Bravo! 
 - I like it!

387
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,800
That's amazing.

388
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,250
- That's exactly what I said. 
 - That's right.

389
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,050
This was exactly what I had in mind.

390
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,340
It's incredible.

391
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,870
It's nice.

392
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,050
Who thought of it?

393
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,210
Master Seo, I was moved.

394
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,140
You really did a great job this time.

395
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,380
Shouldn't we get some good news from Sweden?

396
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,280
Of course.

397
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,870
How vulgar.

398
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,590
Am I doing this just to get a Nobel Prize?

399
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,900
It's all for the country.

400
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,680
Forgive us, please.

401
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,490
Chairman Park was being frivolous.

402
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,240
That's right. It's for the country.

403
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,400
With that in mind,

404
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,100
shouldn't we start moving those having a hard time to the Dream Village?

405
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,590
Yes, that's right. At the Myeongdong or Gangnam station,

406
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,070
why are there so many homeless people and beggars who are struggling?

407
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,240
That's why, Chairman Park, your hotels are losing money, isn't?

408
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,750
All foreign tourists have stopped staying there, right?

409
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,620
Talking of serious problems, are mine as serious as  Chairman Min or Minister Cha Gyeong Hui?

410
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,020
Chairman Min's duty-free shop is in deficit and Minister Cha Gyeong Hui's son is about to be on trial.

411
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,770
Seoul needs to regain its old self to improve its national prestige anyway.

412
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,830
Foreign investment will also come back.

413
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,400
Why wouldn't it?

414
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,290
In that way, both your fortunes will be restored, right?

415
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,950
Your approval rating will return, too, Mr. President.

416
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,930
Nevertheless, Mr. President,

417
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,570
it seems that cooperation of the relevant ministries for the Dream Village are being delayed forever.

418
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,120
I guess they don't listen to the president?

419
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,680
I've only finished the first phase of housing complex.

420
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,250
We still have a lot of work to do.

421
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,390
Should the administration be holding us back?

422
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,860
It's because there are a lot of things you want done.

423
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,090
The greenbelt issue must be resolved.  Evicting the residents at the shantytown on the premises

424
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,300
and then those houses need to be demolished.

425
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:20,920
- Right? 
 - But wasn't that all agreed upon?

426
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,980
It's a business to save the country.

427
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,040
Don't play with words. How is it a business to save the country?

428
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,910
Why are you raising your voice?

429
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,830
I am someone who became president with the support of the common people.

430
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,430
The shantytown people are all precious citizens to me.

431
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,500
- Honey, stop it. 
 - Seriously! Hey!

432
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,460
Why would you meddle?

433
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,090
Where... what the hell?

434
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,600
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

435
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,240
I shouldn't have made that mistake...

436
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,120
Director Jeong, are you crazy?

437
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,470
It's wet. What's this? Damn.

438
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,450
I am sorry.

439
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:57,170
Damn. I think it's wet down to my underwear. Honey.

440
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,670
Where did the napkins go?

441
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,810
Come on!

442
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,790
So annoying!

443
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,710
Why are they acting up?

444
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,780
I am not that old Heo Jeong Se! I'm the commander-in-chief!

445
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,020
Is the commander-in-chief a pushover?

446
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,960
Those businessmen are bastards.

447
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,380
- Are you okay, Honey? 
 - I'm not okay.

448
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,990
You seem too worked up right now, so get a massage and rest.

449
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,610
- Should I? 
 - Yes.

450
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,760
Seriously, what the hell!

451
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,970
Oh my. Your neck has a lot of knots.

452
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,180
Director Jeong?

453
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,070
Just a minute.  I'll loosen the knots first and then tell you something.

454
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,800
Director Jeong, how come  you're here?

455
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,810
But ... do you know anything about massage therapy or hand acupuncture?

456
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,260
I come from a dirt-poor background, you see.

457
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,390
There's nothing I hadn't done until I met Master Seo.

458
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,370
I lived doing massage therapy for a while.

459
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,270
I wouldn't have known.

460
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,660
I was touched earlier.

461
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,830
The heart that's considerate of the powerless and displaced people.

462
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,060
That's a given.

463
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,490
Will 10% of the Dream Village business profits

464
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,260
help change that heart?

465
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,040
Director Jeong speaks cleverly.

466
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,160
I am just an errand runner,

467
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,440
Master Seo arranged everything.

468
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,770
Who else can run errands so cleverly?

469
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,430
I think you are amazing, Director Jeong. Every time I see you ...

470
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,750
Do you like it?

471
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,980
What did you just say to me?

472
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,440
I need to relieve your facial stress with massage too.

473
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,240
Ah, facial massage.

474
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,320
Shall we?

475
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,200
Oh, but, I mean, how did you get in here, Director Jeong?

476
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,410
It's not...

477
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,300
Not anyone

478
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,570
can get in here...

479
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,000
Young Master, I'll protect you.

480
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,020
Poor Young Master.

481
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,340
Young Master?

482
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,290
Kang Yo Han isn't home right now.

483
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,000
This house belongs to you, Young Master,

484
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,390
not to that child.

485
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,300
 Request for Summary Order 

486
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,600
The suspect Lee Yeong Min hit the cheek and punched the abdomen

487
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,600
of the victim, Lee Ji Hun, when he asked him about his parked car.

488
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,480
Is Lee Yeong Miin someone with anger control disorder?

489
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,090
Why would he do this at a restaurant?

490
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,110
He probably lived without needing any control.

491
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,760
Why bother to control it?

492
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,420
  Kim Yeon Hui!  

493
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,940
  Okay, Thank you.  

494
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,010
  Why did we come to this messy place?  

495
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,400
  Oppa.  

496
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,150
  This is a famous alleyway restaurant because it was on a TV-show.  

497
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,520
  It's a hot place.  

498
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,900
  Okay  

499
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,230
  You should eat a lot.  

500
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,430
  You are not allowed to park here.  

501
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,270
  Is the owner of car 0615 here?  

502
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,400
  Is the owner of car 0615 here?  

503
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,900
  Is the owner of car 0615 here? I'm sorry.  

504
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,460
  - Is the owner of car 0615 here? 
 - That's our car. 

505
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,060
  It's our car, Oppa.  

506
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,240
  Are you the owner of the car in front of the restaurant?  

507
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,880
  - So... 
 - I'm sorry but can you move the car?  

508
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,700
  Why?  

509
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,590
  If it's parked there, it obstructs traffic. People are complaining  

510
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,250
  - I'm sorry. 
 - Here.  

511
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,980
  - You move it. 
 - Excuse me?  

512
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,390
 I gave you the car key for you to move it.  

513
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,260
  I can't carelessly drive a customer's car...  

514
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,400
  Hey.  Don't you see I'm drinking?  

515
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,890
  Will you take responsibility if I get caught drinking and driving?  

516
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,900
  - Then the lady... 
 - Ah damnit!  

517
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,000
  Hey, are you kidding me right now?  

518
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,110
  Is there a place with no valet parking these days? 

519
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,480
  Where are they, huh?  

520
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,870
  You put me in a bad mood because of you doing business in a crap place like this.  

521
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,510
  - I said stop it! 
 - Let go!  

522
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,530
  You shouldn't be like this.  

523
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,690
  How could you hit someone, sir?  

524
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,360
  - Ah, I can't do that, huh?  

525
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,460
  You can't do this!  

526
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,600
  Can you hit me, huh?  Hit me, you bastard!  

527
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,960
Among the victims, did the cook  have a record for assault?

528
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,880
That's why he tried hard to bear it as much as he could.

529
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,170
  Please don't do this. Don't do this. 

530
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,650
  What? You need money too, don't you?  

531
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,680
  Then you should get hit.  

532
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,640
  - I'm begging you to stop. 
 - Why?  Why should I?  

533
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,910
  Why should I stop?  

534
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,300
  Why do you keep telling me to stop?  

535
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,010
  It's fun right now, no? Isn't it?  

536
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,540
  Is it not fun? It's fun.  

537
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,530
 You really! 

538
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,510
Even though his side tried to get them to do a settlement multiple times, because they were so furious,

539
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,970
they all refused. They said they'd never do it.

540
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,430
The three victims were of a same mind on this.

541
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,330
Yes, Minister.

542
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,820
Yes, Chief Justice.

543
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,340
- Hello? 
 -  Is this Mr. Kim Seong Hun? 

544
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
 Yes, speaking. 

545
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,690
This is the Prosecutors' Office.

546
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,930
-  You will have to come see us.    
 - For what reason?

547
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,980
 You have previously been investigated on charges of assault, haven't you?  

548
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,880
I was punished for it and the case is over.

549
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,690
-  Not necessarily. We are the ones deciding whether it's over.   
 - Sorry?

550
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,810
 We've had information that the investigation back then was insufficient.  

551
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,260
So you should come.

552
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,900
You understand me, don't you?

553
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,310
 Kang Yo Han's family certificate?  

554
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,090
Yes. I'm sure there is something in there.

555
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,060
 Can you look it up for me? 

556
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,420
Well, I'm not sure.

557
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,800
There's no criminal charges against him right now, so I don't know if I can.

558
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,110
Right.

559
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,530
 Still, I'll try to find out.  

560
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,540
- Thanks, Su Hyeon. 
 -  No worries, bye. 

561
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,530
There's a document for you.

562
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,380
Thank you.

563
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,440
What's this? Another one?

564
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,330
Did you receive another settlement agreement?

565
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,240
Yesterday it was the young male employee's, and today we get the female part-timer's.

566
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,240
"It was resolved amicably and the victim does not wish for a criminal punishment", it says.

567
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,130
Oh? This woman  even filed a petition asking Lee Yeong Min be severely punished.

568
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,950
And such person submitted a settlement agreement right on the day before the trial.

569
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,650
Ah, the defendant must really have expressed a lot of remorse this time.

570
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,930
I can't imagine how sincere his apology must have felt, for her to change her mind.

571
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,690
- Listen, Young Master. 
 - Yes?

572
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,590
Does the world seem all sweet and pretty as flowers to you?

573
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,490
What do you mean?

574
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,490
Powerful people don't show remorse.

575
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,880
Showing remorse is what the powerless do.

576
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,400
Do you get it?

577
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,250
Yes.

578
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,060
 I'm sorry. 

579
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,800
- I'm sorry. 
 - Don't be. Why would you be?

580
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,800
I'll take care of it myself.

581
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,680
Will you go to the trial tomorrow?

582
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,250
I should.

583
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:52,530
Honestly, I wouldn't feel as wronged now if I had given him a good punch then.

584
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,300
If I had done that, I would have put it behind me.

585
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,770
But I can't live on like this. I might die from anger.

586
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,240
Chef.

587
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,760
Forget it. You two haven't done anything wrong.

588
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,600
Chef!

589
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,400
I'm saying this out of concern for you, Judge Kang.

590
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,930
In situations like this, confronting the prosecution head-to-head is—

591
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,060
Chief Justice, sir.

592
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,080
Do you believe that every citizen is equal before the law?

593
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,900
I don't know. But why do you ask?

594
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,250
I don't believe that.

595
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,570
I think it's a very naive idea, like believing that Santa Claus comes on Christmas.

596
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:37,390
But aren't there times when you would like to believe in such naive ideas?

597
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,780
Listen, Judge Kang—

598
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,790
Please think of this trial as a 'Christmas special' movie.

599
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,450
Oh, and also...

600
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,420
Please tell them they do not need to worry about me.

601
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,590
How come you woke up early?

602
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,820
You seemed to sleep until noon every day.

603
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,920
Lee Yeong Min's trial is today, isn't it?

604
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,800
Are you going to cheer me on?

605
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,320
I know this case is lacking evidence.

606
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,270
If you ever need someone to testify...

607
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,660
Why, did you see something?

608
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,570
I saw him driving in a threatening way.

609
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,030
Did you?

610
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,770
And you didn't see anything else?

611
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,360
 Hey. Hey, hey! 

612
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,670
Don't worry about the trial. Be good and focus on recuperating.

613
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,170
Dear citizens, you have waited a long time.

614
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,740
 The live court that was postponed due to an unexpected accident is now resuming. 

615
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,980
 We cannot wait to see what kind of satisfying trial will be shown before us today.  

616
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,720
 It's now time for the second Live Court Show to start. 

617
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,700
 Give a big round of applause!  
    

618
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,210
 Before we begin the trial, 

619
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:11,540
 dear citizens, there is something I must tell you.  

620
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:17,400
 Unfortunately, Judge Kim Ga On cannot be present with us on this trial.  

621
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,930
- What the heck is that? 
 -  Let us pray that Judge Kim can come back to us in good health. 

622
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,620
We need your prayers, dear citizens.

623
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,310
Why is he making such a big deal out of it?

624
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:31,180
There could be some people who do not want this trial to proceed.

625
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,140
And among them, there must be many powerful people.

626
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,760
The only ones who can protect us is you, the citizens of this country.

627
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,910
We respect you! Be strong!

628
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,960
Be strong!

629
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,500
 Defendant 

630
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,890
Let us start with the trial. 
    

631
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,380
The defendant has been indicted

632
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,760
with charges of assault for verbal abuse and infliction of injury

633
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,450
against the head cook, an employee and a part-timer in a restaurant.

634
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,030
Defendant Lee Yeong Min, please step forward.

635
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,760
Defendant Lee Yeong Min.

636
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,100
Please step forward.

637
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,120
Why?

638
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,650
 Prosecutor 

639
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,440
Your Honor.

640
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,470
Yes, Prosecutor.

641
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,820
I think there is something to clarify before we begin with the trial.

642
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,200
Is that so? Please tell us.

643
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,390
As you already know, this is a simple assault case.

644
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:02,820
For this kind of crime, if the victim doesn't wish the defendant to be punished, he cannot be punished.

645
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,910
In the case that all the victims submit a settlement agreement,

646
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:08,790
the prosecution has no choice but to cancel the indictment.

647
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,800
Isn't there one victim who hasn't agreed to settle yet?

648
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,920
Are you referring to this person?

649
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,000
Please go to the witness stand.

650
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,950
Please take a seat.

651
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,230
 Witness 

652
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:34,270
Do you wish to say something?

653
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,530
I wish that the defendant

654
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,920
is not punished.

655
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,880
 Content 

656
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,280
- Mr. Kim Seong Hun? 
 - Yes.

657
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,440
- You filed several petitions asking for the defendant to receive severe punishment, is that right? 
 - Yes.

658
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,710
May I ask the reason why you have changed your mind?

659
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,180
I just...

660
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,600
- I wanted to stop. 
 - Why is that?

661
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:18,090
  Is there anything you can't tell me, boss?  

662
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,850
  Tell me. What's the reason?  

663
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,910
  - The building's been sold. 
 - What?  

664
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:28,200
  This whole building was sold. To some company.  

665
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,300
  Why this old building in the outskirts. Why all of the sudden?  

666
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,190
  - They're demolishing it. 
 - What? Are they going to put up a new building?  

667
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:39,440
  They're just demolishing it. They're just going to leave it as bare land.  

668
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,530
  They want to keep the restaurant vacant until the contract expires.  

669
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:47,610
  I mean, then you'll be kicked out without even getting compensation. Perhaps it's —  

670
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:51,010
Stop whining, it was probably a coincidence.

671
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:57,680
Things like that may happen in life, right?

672
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,930
Since no one got hurt, why not pretend as if nothing happened?

673
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,050
Is that so?

674
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,000
Since all the victims don't want the defendant to be punished,

675
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,730
the prosecution has no choice but to drop the charges, Your Honor.

676
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:19,840
Oh, uh, Your Honor?

677
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:25,330
Give me a bit of time... Ah, that ...

678
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,430
I'm sorry.

679
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,600
 I'm sorry. 

680
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:56,620
  What do I do about this? I'm sorry. 

681
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,910
Then I'll end the trial with this.

682
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,620
- Prosecutor? 
 - Yes.

683
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:09,670
What do you call a person repeating the same thing?

684
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,080
What do you mean by that all of a sudden?

685
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,740
Cases where the same crime is repeated habitually.

686
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,490
Did they not teach you about that in law school?

687
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:22,360
Are you talking about habitual offenders?

688
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,710
Simple assault cannot be punished if there is a settlement.

689
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,070
But is that the case with habitual assault as well?

690
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:32,930
It's not. However, there is no evidence to label the accused Lee Yeong Min as a habitual offender.

691
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:36,690
How many times has he hit someone but since there was a settlement,  you didn't prosecute and dropped the charges?

692
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,190
A total of 12 times.

693
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,260
- But are those alone enough proof? 
 - Is it not enough?

694
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,880
Prosecutors these days are very attentive to the guarantee of human rights.

695
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,790
It's very commendable. Please go back.

696
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,500
 Defendant 

697
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,490
- Then let's ask the all the citizens. 
 - Excuse me?

698
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,860
All the citizens who are participating in this trial right now.

699
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,540
By chance, is the defendant's face familiar?

700
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,520
Close up on Lee Yeong Min. Go! More, more!

701
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,770
Judge, what on earth are you doing?

702
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:17,550
If you look at the DIKE app you downloaded, there is a button for video transmission.

703
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:21,940
Please tell me if you are familiar with the defendant's face.

704
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:30,290
  I'll pay you 10,000 won! 10,000 won!  

705
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,880
 - I'm paying you generously. 
 - You did a good job. 

706
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,480
- You're here? 
 - Yes, yes.

707
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,170
- Be careful. I'm going to weigh this. 
 - Okay, okay.

708
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,030
- You're here. 
 -  Hi. Thanks, thanks.

709
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,950
- You should rest a bit. 
 - Yes, right.

710
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,130
That...

711
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,920
Hey, what is this?

712
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,580
I’ll take care of it.

713
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,010
Producer, we got a tip-off video coming in. Shall we connect?

714
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,060
Okay, do it.

715
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,230
  It connected. What is this? Is this really going out nationwide?  

716
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,250
Yes, it's showing you very well. Go ahead.

717
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,000
Hello, Judge!

718
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,410
I'm a big fan. You're so cool.

719
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,560
All my friends are going crazy too.

720
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,890
Thank you. So,  do you recognize the defendant's face?

721
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:27,190
  I know it! That crazy bast... Right, this is a broadcast...  

722
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,220
  That man is a complete psycho.  

723
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,730
 I worked part-time at a department store parking lot. 

724
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,160
  I did this..  

725
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,460
- Yes. So? 
 - But well, that man,

726
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,530
he came out of the car, screaming that there was a traffic jam in the parking lot.

727
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,390
Then he started kicking the parking attendant.

728
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:48,060
  I was so startled that I went there. Asking me who I was, he slapped my face.  

729
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,290
  But the company told me to endure it because he was a VVIP guest.  

730
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:57,550
 I was very angry and resentful. 

731
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,990
Hey! You f**king cra...

732
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,620
Is it all right  for you to say that now?

733
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,890
  Yes, no problem. I was fired anyway.  

734
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,850
Objection! This has not even been officially investigated...

735
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:18,080
Are you willing to make an official statement to the investigative agency about all that happened at that time?

736
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,340
  Of course! I'm already pissed off. This works out.  

737
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,500
 Please make sure to punish him! I beg you.  

738
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,670
 He's a regular at my place, and he hits people every time he comes. 

739
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:36,350
Waiter, bartender, valet guy. Anyone who he thought was an easy target he would hit! That's not right!

740
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:40,280
  In addition, there was this new female employee. 

741
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,660
 I was trying to calm her down when she was crying.  

742
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,540
 Wow.  Do I really need to do all of this as part of my work? 

743
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:50,170
 And whenever things don't go according to his liking, he just uses violence! 

744
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,080
 He doesn't provide hospital fees, or insurance. 

745
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,320
  I'm okay if I'm fired. 

746
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,400
 I'll tell everything! 

747
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,680
 There's so much I can say. 

748
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,050
  - The valet guy.  
 - That jerk.

749
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:06,850
 Do you know how old he is? He probably has a son his age! 

750
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,860
  He just kicked him in the shin, saying he didn't park his car well. 

751
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,860
 No, I wouldn't have told you if he only had dragged him out.  

752
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:23,210
  He came into our store last month and insisted on changing his phone screen.  

753
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:27,360
  I told him we couldn't do that, and he started pushing me abruptly and tried to step all over me.  

754
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,740
 When I told him to stop, he suddenly started to break all of the displays at our store. 

755
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:35,880
  - "Who are you to block me?" ...
 - I am...  

756
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,540
  It's a high-paying part-time job ...  
 - With the yellow sport car ... 

757
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,270
It was because of this.

758
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:56,130
That's why he put him on a public trial.

759
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,580
What kind of bullshit is this?

760
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,670
It looks like a Christmas tree.

761
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:55,450
Dear citizens, how do you want to punish a man like this?

762
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:01,060
  A trial is a game. A game where if you can't prove it, you lose.  

763
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,260
  Severe punishment - Against 11% 

764
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,360
  In favor 89%.  

765
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,450
Cut! Cut! Yes!!

766
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:17,090
3 million! We broke through! It's done! It's done!

767
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,810
Is it still not enough? Proof of habituality.

768
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:27,700
This court requires the prosecution to change the indictment.

769
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,520
This case is not just simple assault but habitual assault.

770
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,830
Change the arraignment and proceed to trial.

771
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:41,630
It's best to rush. This anger may be directed at the prosecution if it's too slow.

772
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,040
- Mr. Kim Seong Hun. 
 - Yes?

773
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,180
Habitual assault can be punished even if an assailant agrees to settle with a victim.

774
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,990
The incident against Kim Seong Hun will also be judged.

775
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,960
Thank you, thank you.

776
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,360
I'm not going to allow any of the cases get buried.

777
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,380
Justice cannot be bought with money.

778
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,090
A little more, a little more! Audience! Reaction! Reaction!

779
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,920
 What's the reason you decided to join that horribly unfair game?  

780
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,660
 A reason. Must there always be a reason? 

781
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:36,040
  Is there something you want to fix? Or something you regret?  

782
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,690
 Eichmann in Jerusalem 

783
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,980
What a curious princess you are.

784
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,440
Who is this man?

785
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,060
Who is it?

786
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,480
- Young Master Isaac. 
 - Isaac?

787
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,930
Yes, Young Master Isaac, older brother of Young Master Yo Han.

788
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:07,760
The rightful heir of this mansion.

789
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,550
Kang Yo Han's older brother?

790
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:22,600
Then, did this man live in this basement?

791
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,250
- No. 
 - Then?

792
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,890
This place is...

793
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:31,790
This is Young Master Yo Han's room.

794
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,340
What?

795
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:40,000
 Yo Han was an abandoned child. 

796
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:43,770
 Nobody wanted him. 

797
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,030
Kang Yo Han had been abandoned?

798
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,400
Then was he not blood-related to this household? Can you tell me the details? Please?

799
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,280
What I'm suspicious about is Kang Yo Han.

800
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,850
I already know that he is someone capable of anything.

801
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,490
He already did astonishing things even as an elementary school student.

802
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:04,240
So yours was not just simple curiosity, after all.

803
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,580
Then you should look into it yourself.

804
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:16,060
 This house belongs to you, Young Master, not to that child. 

805
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,890
Isaac must have been lacking in some way?

806
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:22,210
What?

807
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:28,560
There is no way that the owner of house would have given his entire estate to someone who is not related by blood.

808
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,450
So maybe Kang Yo Han deserved it more?

809
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,860
What do you know?

810
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:40,960
I'm sorry.

811
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:51,260
If it's difficult to talk about, you don't have to.

812
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,960
You resemble him a lot.

813
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,570
Especially your eyes.

814
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:02,930
Young Master Isaac lost his mother early.

815
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:07,940
Chairman Kang stayed holed up at home all the time after he lost his wife.

816
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:12,260
The source of trouble began when Chairman Kang's friends took him to bars.

817
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:16,530
 A barmaid who spent one night with the chairman when he was drunk and half-unconscious 

818
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:21,780
 came to this mansion demanding money because she was pregnant. 

819
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,120
 After being refused, that woman... 

820
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,240
 Dad. 

821
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,580
 Dad. 

822
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:52,180
 Eichmann in Jerusalem 
 Crime and Punishment 
 The Moon and Sixpence 

823
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:06,050
 Father! 

824
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,030
 Chairman, why do you hate Young Master Yo Han so much? 

825
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,820
 It's fine if you fire me. What did a child do so wrong? 

826
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:50,220
 Because he resembles me. That boy resembles me so much. 

827
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:58,940
 But Isaac... 

828
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,550
 Isaac is different. 

829
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:11,370
 Yo Han will someday devour his older brother. 

830
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,600
Then why do you suspect Yo Han, too?

831
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:18,360
What do you mean?

832
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,620
You said that Young Master Isaac was the rightful heir to this mansion.

833
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,960
Doesn't that mean that Kang Yo Han stole his place in some wrongful way?

834
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,550
Do you have evidence to suspect Kang Yo Han?

835
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:30,800
No, nothing like that.

836
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,130
But according to what you said, Kang Yo Han is a victim of his father's abuse.

837
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,030
And I also breastfed him and raised him.

838
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:43,620
But before all that, Young Master Yo Han was already someone who was capable of anything,

839
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,580
just as you said before.

840
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,110
So why exactly ...

841
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:51,320
He made the maid who liked him jump off the second floor

842
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,340
and fed weed killer to the hunting dog that the chairman cherished.

843
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:38,790
 Was there perhaps some reason for those actions? 

844
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:44,900
 Perhaps they bothered him in some way. But they could also be just simple pranks. 

845
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:51,780
 But what child would do such things without any hesitation? 

846
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,640
Who are you?

847
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,750
It's been a long time.

848
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,290
Don't you remember me?

849
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,150
You... you...

850
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,540
That... Catholic church.

851
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,220
Fire.

852
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:45,650
Oh no. He's going to catch me!

853
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:48,610
What should I do?

854
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:04,130
But Isaac was good to Kang Yo Han, you said.

855
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,030
And they had a good relationship, didn't they?

856
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,730
Young Master Yo Han was a survivor of a fire...

857
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,690
Don't come closer!

858
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:14,950
 Have you heard about that? 

859
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:16,260
 Yes. 

860
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,850
It happened only one month after the chairman passed away.

861
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:24,940
And Young Master Isaac died in that fire.

862
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:18,890
You didn't sell this?

863
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:22,640
Perhaps you liked it?

864
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:28,030
Spare me... spare me...

865
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,840
 The Devil Judge  
  We thank actor Joo Seok Tae for his special appearence. 

866
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:07,100
♫  I stay up all night  ♫

867
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,500
♫  I think about your eyes  ♫

868
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,510
 Does it have to be Cha Gyeong Hui? 

869
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,040
 Equality Before the Law 

870
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,700
 The next term of the presidency, I mean. 

871
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,500
 What are you saying right now? 

872
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,190
 Tell me. What happened in this house? 

873
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:22,560
 How do you think Yo Han became the owner of this house? 

874
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,730
 You know about the fire at the Catholic church ten years ago, don't you? 

875
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,900
 What did you find out, Kim Ga On? 

876
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,760
 What is it that you want from me? Power? Dominance? 

877
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,230
 - What sort of cruelty is this? 
 - It's fun, isn't it? 

878
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:35,560
 Is this also why you killed your older brother? 

879
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,940
 I dare you to say it again! Say it again! 

880
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:44,710
♫  You said I'll live in the sunlight  ♫
