 The cathedral fire scene broadcast on the 11th was not intended to portray a specific person as a villain. We apologize to the firefighters and viewers who felt uncomfortable during this scene. 

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,250
 This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea.  All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional. 

10
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,030
Did you have a nightmare?

11
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,790
I don't think you're feeling well.

12
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,140
Are you okay?

13
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,430
- Don't touch me. 
 - What's the matter?

14
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,480
What are you guys doing now?

15
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,360
What about you?!

16
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,580
Did I cluelessly interrupt you?

17
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,820
What are you doing here?

18
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,870
I came here to talk to you. I think it's better to do it later.

19
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,350
I don't think you're feeling well.

20
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,390
- What happened earlier? 
 - What?

21
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,410
Whatever woke you up.

22
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,670
What surprised you so much? It's not like Yo Han.

23
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,510
- You were completely caught off guard. 
 - What do you want to say?

24
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,400
It's as if you saw the face of the man you killed.

25
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,550
I don't think about a guy I've already killed.

26
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,080
If I actually killed him, that is.

 Episode 5 

28
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,530
Chief,

29
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,120
I'm so sorry about yesterday.

30
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,720
I have nothing to say even if you kick me off the panel.

31
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,600
Kick you off?

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,920
Telling someone who's been through that kind of pain that he killed his own brother...

33
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,020
I am really sorry.

34
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,250
 Animal Behavioral Science 

35
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,400
That's right.

36
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,250
It's not something I want to hear from this face.

37
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,690
It's hard for you to look at my face, right?

38
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,690
I will leave the panel.

39
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,810
You don't need to apologize for a coincidence.

40
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,380
It's just a coincidence that this face is similar.

41
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,950
- It's not just that. 
 - What if it's not just that?

42
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:21,500
-Don't you know? I'm suspicious of you and am tracking you.

43
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,750
I am curious to know how much you figured out.

44
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,940
That you’ve been preparing a long time for this hunt?

45
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,290
A hunt which I have been preparing for a long time?

46
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,810
I've looked through all your past trial records.

47
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,340
Nothing stood out. You went by the book.

48
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,800
You judged like a machine.

49
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Hunters hide their scents thoroughly until it's time to eat.

50
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,920
 I also don't know why I did that on that day, Your Honor. 

51
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,790
 The child I gave life to, in my old age, is as precious as my life. 

52
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,060
 Because of that drink, without knowing, it my hands— 
 Judge's Bench 

53
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,490
 I mean, you beat the kid half to death. Is that what you call an excuse? 

54
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,980
 Please kill me, Your Honor. 

55
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,310
 Since I was fired from my job and had to go live in semi-basement rooms, 

56
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,110
 I realized that because of the lack of money, living wasn't living. 

57
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,540
 I must have lost my mind. 

58
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,020
 It's not just this once. 

59
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,300
 The defendant has repeatedly assaulted his wife and son over the years. 

60
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,170
 - He must be punished severely. 
 - I was wrong, Your Honor. 

61
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,700
 Please forgive me just this once, Your Honor. I've sinned enough to die. 

62
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,430
 I'll never touch my child again. 

63
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,210
 Judge, if you forgive me this once, I will resolve to live life diligently. 

64
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,030
 Please forgive me just once. Please, I beg you. 

65
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,660
 I'm so sorry. 

66
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,720
 If you forgive me this once, I'll never... 

67
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,340
 The fact that the family of the victims is pleading for leniency for the defendant, 

68
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,600
 and given that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime, 

69
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,170
 we suspend the above sentence of imprisonment for the defendant. 

70
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,200
 Your Honor! 

71
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,740
  TN: In S.Korea, being intoxicated at the time of commission of a crime is considered acting with impaired thinking. 

72
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,030
 Alcoholism is a justification in S. Korea for mitigation (lessening) of criminal punishment. 

73
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,310
There was just one thing, I did not get your motive.

74
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,450
I just don't understand.

75
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,750
I'll bet.

76
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:48,950
- But the anger, I understand that.  
 - Do you understand?

77
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,640
Even if no one in this world understands, I do. That feeling.

78
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,670
But what's wrong is wrong.

79
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,240
It's a crime to use a trial as a tool.

80
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,220
That's funny.

81
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,430
I don't remember asking you to understand me.

82
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,730
I don't need your understanding. You need to choose.

83
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,630
Will you stand in front of me or stand by me?

84
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,840
For your information, I clear out everything that blocks me, without any hesitation.

85
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,050
I'm well aware.

86
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,100
Then get out.

87
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,700
I'm not going to kick you out.

88
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,720
Come back to the court.

89
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,710
It's fun, being with you.

90
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,720
It's as predicted.

91
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,170
Then why are you doing that?

92
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,960
Who knows?

93
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,530
Seeing that I'm being shown such sympathy, should I say I'm a little embarrassed?

94
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,720
And I don't have much experience saying that.

95
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,990
Besides that, what about Cha Gyeong Hui's movements?

96
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,890
Hey, lady!

97
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,660
This isn't a place where you can go wherever you want.

98
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,830
Please leave, leave quickly. What are you doing?

99
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,380
Minister.

100
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,950
The flogging isn't over yet, so family visits are difficult.

101
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,330
Class 9 Park Young Jin, prison officer.

102
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,800
- Have you ever seen a Correctional Headquarters Organization Chart? 
 - Pardon?

103
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,150
You're in charge here, aren't you?

104
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,570
Above you, there's the head of the local correctional service who oversees the detention center.

105
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,110
And above him, there's the head of the correctional department that oversees the heads of the National Correctional Service.

106
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,850
Yes, I know.

107
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,470
I'm the one who commands that Correctional Service.

108
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,190
I'm not a family member of an inmate.

109
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,350
I am here as the head of correctional administration in Korea.

110
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,220
Move.

111
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,230
Supervise well until the sentence is completely carried out.

112
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,640
Yes, I understand.

113
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,880
You're cooking today, what's the occasion?

114
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,010
First of all, because we have a guest.

115
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,770
Guest.. I'm just...

116
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,390
Although it's an uninvited guest.

117
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,690
Yes, yes.

118
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,650
By the way, do you like Korean food?

119
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,000
I can only cook Korean food.

120
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,280
I really like Korean food.

121
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,590
What are you doing here?

122
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,620
I'm sorry, Young Master. Since there is a guest, for once I—

123
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,840
I told you not to stay in this house after sunset.

124
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,740
I am sorry.

125
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,920
Ajumoni!

126
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,660
Ajumoni.

127
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,130
You did it out of thoughtfulness, so why is he like that?

128
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,850
He's suspicious of being poisoned.

129
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,590
He's scared of what he's done.

130
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,990
Do you really think he did that?

131
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,980
The kid you breastfed.

132
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,380
In fact, you don't want to believe it, do you?

133
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,280
I'm sorry, but please throw away the food.

134
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,440
There are bugs.

135
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,620
Seriously? Do you really need to do this at the Blue House*? 
   (President's residence in Korea) 

136
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,890
Don't talk about things you don't know. We have zero presence right because because of Kang Yo Han.

137
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,180
I have to say something.

138
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,110
It's working. I've been stuck here for a long time but it's working.

139
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,740
Hey, get out of here. Go.

140
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,230
Hello,

141
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,450
Korean Total Change

142
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,200
This is Heo Jung Se, this is Heo Jung Se's "So Refreshing!".

143
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,680
 Where on earth am I? You probably know? 

144
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,960
 It's the presidential residence. It's Korea's first exclusive reveal 

145
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,700
 of a live Blue House Tour. 

146
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,810
 From now on, from now on, follow me! 

147
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,870
Now,

148
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,690
my beloved and respected citizens,

149
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,170
 I think I'm just a servant of the people. 

150
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,360
 Aren't I perfectly cut out be a servant? 

151
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,970
 Ma'am! 

152
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,750
 Long time no see, everyone. Hello, everyone. 

153
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,320
 Thank you. Beauty is real, class is forever. 

154
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,580
 It's all thanks to your love. 

155
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,990
 The Blue House tour with the celebrity couple. 

156
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,800
 Let's get started. 

157
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,640
 How is it? Isn't it amazing to actually see the Blue House? 

158
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,480
 It was really amazing for us. 

159
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,850
 I was really amazed at first. 

160
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,190
 But all people live the same. 

161
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,930
Oh, by the way, I heard they were remodeling the presidential residence a few days ago.

162
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,100
I really scolded the secretary who brought it up.

163
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,860
 It's like the people's blood, but it's blood tax, right? 

164
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,270
We're moving the presidential residence to a small place.

165
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,830
It's like a welfare facility or something—

166
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,580
How did you come up with such a great idea?

167
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,590
This is something I am... carefully contemplating.

168
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,570
- I'm constantly thinking about it. 
 - That's right.

169
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,100
Because there are so many people who have it so hard.

170
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,840
This is my favorite place.

171
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,690
 I've been doing woodcraft for a long time. 

172
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,070
 She's an artist. 

173
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,550
 Not too long ago, a curator at a gallery suggested that I do an exhibition. 

174
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,420
I'm so sorry, but the Cabinet meeting is about to begin.

175
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,960
That's all for today. Shall we shout it out, for the first time in a while.

176
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,370
 Korea Total Change. This is Heo Jung Se! 

177
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,930
 this is Heo Jung Se's "So Refreshing!" 

178
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,970
 Everyone, bye-bye. 

179
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,630
Hey, hey!

180
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,470
Why are you talking about your private exhibition here?

181
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,290
I'm the mother of this country.

182
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,540
What's wrong with me doing a solo exhibition?

183
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,780
 Still, what are your feelings, as a mother? 

184
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,130
 No. Before being a mother,  

185
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,240
 I'm the one responsible for bestowing justice. 
   

186
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,780
I'm only fulfilling my responsibilities, without making any exceptions.

187
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,270
Is there another public official like this?

188
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,890
Once again, everyone, please give a round of applause to Minister Cha Gyeong Hui.

189
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,480
Thank you.

190
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,770
Yes, we will listen to your message in a moment.

191
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,800
Thank you for your hard work. Get some rest.

192
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,930
I'll go take a little break.

193
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,770
As expected, you're amazing. Turning a crisis into an opportunity.

194
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,550
The foundation seems to be just watching.

195
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,020
I have to survive in my own way.

196
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,760
From what I know, the Minister's method is to attack rather than defend.

197
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,650
That's a face that has something prepared.

198
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,790
Indeed. You have to go in.

199
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,530
The show isn't over yet.

200
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,970
I'm hesitant to say this,

201
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,430
but regarding this case of flogging, there are many voices of concern.

202
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,320
This is a picture we obtained. 
  Morning with TV 

203
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,040
Maybe it's too harsh.

204
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,340
There are a lot of people who think

205
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,250
it's too barbaric for the 21st century.

206
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,780
No, it's a punishment he deserves.

207
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,810
I'm so sorry.

208
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,280
I'm sorry.

209
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,160
On the other hand, there were some scenes that we're a little inhuman,

210
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,250
even though it was a trial.

211
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,530
 As the punishment was made in accordance with the will of the people. 

212
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,660
 It would be reasonable to make the punishment public and 

213
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,300
 transparent for the entire nation to watch. 

214
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,290
 Please keep in mind the Justice Department is in charge of executing the sentenced punishment. 

215
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,560
This is Judge Kang Yo Han in a clip from the trial.

216
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,750
This scene has been a real problem.

217
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,680
How do the viewers see it?

218
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,500
Are you all right?

219
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,340
I'm all right.

220
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,050
 Do you think you can continue? 

221
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,010
 I'm so sorry. 

222
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,260
The public is unpredictable.

223
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,270
Pretty good move.

224
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,580
I need to find out who's behind Cha Gyeong Hui.

225
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,510
Kim Ga On! Oh my!

226
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,270
I'm still injured.

227
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,330
Really? I'm sorry! Hey! Do you know how worried I was?

228
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,230
Thank you.

229
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,270
However, I'm still me. Ta-da! There!

230
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,550
What is this?

231
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,860
Accept it. You're an idol now. 
  Handsome Kim Ga On 

232
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,630
- I'm thankful, but why... 
 - Gosh!

233
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,580
Too much humility is arrogance.

234
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,420
People like us who are born to catch the people's eye

235
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,790
must always live with a sense of responsibility.

236
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,730
That's exactly it. Responsibility as a star!

237
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,390
Hello, Producer.

238
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,300
Congratulations.

239
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,200
Just standing still like this, a self-illuminating person

240
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,700
who, during a shocking explosive attack, throws himself on his colleague to save him

241
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,050
and, after being on the brink of death for some days, miraculously returns to court.

242
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,780
I was so moved watching the special broadcast you did for Judge Kim, rooting for him to return alive.

243
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,880
Return alive? I wasn't dying.

244
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,940
Don't be obsessed with the small details.

245
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,700
Usually the more serious the hero's crisis, the better.

246
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,310
Judge Oh indeed knows what storytelling is.

247
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,520
She's just a natural.

248
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,080
- Maestro. 
 - Diva.

249
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,300
Is there another chance in my life to direct work like this?

250
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,410
I'm going to put my life on the line and work hard! Judges, fighting!

251
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,780
Fighting!

252
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,560
- Please get well soon. 
 - Yes. Thank you.

253
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,790
Director! But will it be okay?

254
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,100
What?

255
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,970
The morning talk show? Why did the Minister have to cry?

256
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,620
But you don't have to worry too much.

257
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,720
Usually in order for a program to do well, you have to be surprising in the beginning. It's noise marketing.

258
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,690
What are you talking about?

259
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,260
It's not that big a deal. You're not feeling well too. Rest.

260
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,770
But is a flogging injury that bad?

261
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,240
How would I know?

262
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,550
The execution of the sentence is the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice.

263
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,360
 Idol Kim Ga On. 

264
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,030
 Quality Always 

265
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,530
Yeah, Ga On.

266
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,520
Su Hyeon, do you have time for dinner later?

267
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,180
Of course, I'm free after a long time.

268
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,490
Then I'll decide the menu.

269
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,110
 All right. 

270
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,260
Who are you?

271
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,750
We're from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

272
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,980
Judge Kang Yo Han is leaving the office now.

273
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,800
We've tried mobilizing assistants inside the Prosecutors' Office,

274
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,880
but we failed to find out who is behind Cha Gyeong Hui.

275
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,340
- Is that so? 
  - Could it be that Cha Gyeong Hui is working alone?

276
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,320
They manipulate the images of the flogging wounds and distribute them on air.

277
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,890
Cha Gyeong is not the loud type.

278
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,710
There will be no evidence.

279
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,690
I'll look more into it.

280
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,600
Let's hit the torso first.

281
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,830
What about the foundation's Dream Village Project?

282
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,070
Did you find someone on the front line, who is substantially involved in the project?

283
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,080
Yes, we have one.

284
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,650
Four pm on Saturday, at the place from last time.

285
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,880
Yes, I understand.

286
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,410
 Master, there is a message left by Master Ga On. 

287
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,980
Message?

288
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,430
 You just need to heat up and eat the rice and stew. 

289
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,540
 Don't leave any leftovers and eat it all. 

290
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,300
 That way you can sleep soundly. 

291
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,700
 If you keep skipping meals, you'll get wrinkles. 

292
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,210
 You should think about your age. 

293
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,710
Where do I have wrinkles...

294
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,310
 Wrinkles. Loss of skin elasticity due to aging. 

295
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:58,130
 Phenomenon of skin folding. 

296
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,350
Master Ga On?

297
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,190
When did you get another master?

298
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,310
Are you choosing your own owner now?

299
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,990
There wasn't anything like that in the manual.

300
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,620
Pretending to be asleep, again?

301
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,800
Pretending to be stuck.

302
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,960
It tastes good.

303
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,760
Detective Park, we still have things to talk about, right?

304
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,090
Where that generous severance pay came from.

305
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,000
- Get lost, I have nothing to say. 
 - I checked everything out.

306
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,320
Your gambling debt plus the opening of this store was over a billion won.

307
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,490
Since when did police severance pay become so generous?

308
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,590
Should I guess?

309
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,880
- In exchange for covering up the case, Kang Yo Han— 
 - Let me guess.

310
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,830
How much did you get? From the Foundation?

311
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,680
It was the foundation?

312
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,360
Hey, Kim Ga On. What did you find out?

313
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,070
It's a terrible story. But how can you believe it?

314
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,670
It's just a one-sided statement from Kang Yo Han.

315
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,180
You're right. That's why I'm here to check.

316
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,400
Actually, there was something that bothered me too.

317
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,590
What is it?

318
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,760
The whole cover-up of who was at the fire incident,

319
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,790
it's not something Kang Yo Han could have done in his position ten years ago.

320
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,460
The prosecution and the press, he'd have to stop everything.

321
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,880
- That's true. 
 - But what about the cancellation of the donation agreement?

322
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,400
Wasn't he after his brother's wealth?

323
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,630
That's possible. But if what Kang Yo Hand said it true,

324
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,560
I would also immediately cancel donating to pieces of trash like that.

325
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,390
Well, what's certain is

326
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,760
that man, Kang Yo Han, is doing something dangerous.

327
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,600
I'll take care of this. You keep your distance from him.

328
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,670
- It's the same as it used to be. 
 - What?

329
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,000
 Ga On, I told you they're dangerous kids.  

330
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,050
 Your face is a real mess right now. 

331
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,560
 Ga On, let's stop hurting your face. 

332
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,890
 You're going to get in big trouble acting like this. 

333
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,240
 Ga On, think about your parents in heaven, uh? 

334
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,860
 They must be really upset to see you hurt yourself like this. 

335
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,480
 Su Hyeon. 

336
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,980
I'll be careful, don't worry.

337
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,980
And you can't be mistaken.

338
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,280
- Mistaken? 
 - Whether Kang Yo Han has a situation or not,

339
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,120
it doesn't make a difference. Who doesn't have a situation?

340
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,240
But not everyone is breaking the law.

341
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,250
That's true.

342
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,600
As expected, you're a great cop.

343
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
What do you mean great, bullshit.

344
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,260
 Report Card 
 Your grades have gone up again. 

345
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,800
 Su Hyeon, you're really amazing. 

346
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,740
 You could really go to the police force. 

347
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,600
 - Really? 
 - Of course. 

348
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,320
 But Su Hyeon, do you have to become a police officer? 

349
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,390
 I think this is enough to try anything. 

350
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,080
 I must go there. 

351
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,320
 Why, are you going to become the police chief? 

352
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,840
 No. 

353
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,910
 Then? 

354
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,950
 There's someone I want to keep rescuing. 

355
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,890
 Rescuing? 

356
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,290
 There's someone who keeps making trouble. 

357
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,920
 For that one person, I have to, somehow. 

358
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,610
Actually, I'm not a very good cop.

359
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,300
If that's the case, then you're a lousy cop.

360
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,030
Su Hyeon, I want you to be a real lousy cop this time.

361
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,690
It's gotten too big for one person.

362
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,880
The press, the minister of justice, and even the president are involved.

363
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,100
You saw the detective earlier, didn’t you?

364
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,070
I'm afraid something's going to happen to you.

365
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,890
Can we just be lousy and cowardly?

366
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,860
I think it's too late for that.

367
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,160
This trial is a case of—

368
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,450
Let's do another case this time.

369
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,920
- What do you mean by another case? 
 - There's a case which they really want us to do.

370
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,220
At the express demand of the prosecution.

371
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,150
Is that so?

372
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,500
It's not a good thing that only one institution is in the spotlight.

373
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,010
Let's give them a chance.

374
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,630
Going forward, the trial cases will be roughly pre-arranged.

375
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,400
Just know that.

376
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,690
It's only the beginning, wouldn't it be better to be a box office hit first?

377
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,450
Social stability comes first.

378
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,130
If it's hard for you to agree with that,

379
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,750
although not as good as Judge Kang,

380
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,070
there are many excellent judges in this country's judiciary.

381
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,410
Is that so?

382
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,030
Don't forget who's in charge of personnel management, Chief Kang.

383
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,960
I'll keep that in mind.

384
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,510
Indeed  the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court never forgets

385
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,070
who's in charge of personnel management.

386
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,890
Chief Kang!

387
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,910
Dear citizens, let's greet the judges

388
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:20,080
who will preside over today's trial with a round of applause! 
  You are the judge. 

389
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,620
Today, we'll welcome Judge Kim Ga On,

390
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,770
who overcame death and returned to our side!

391
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,170
Kim Ga On! 
  Handsome Ga On  
   Idol Judge Kim Ga On 

392
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,970
 Handsome Kim Ga On 

393
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,080
Do not be alarmed by the defendant of today's trial.

394
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,450
This is the top star national actor,

395
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,450
Nam Seok Hun.

396
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,720
 Defendant's seat. 

397
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,860
 What brought him here? 

398
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,050
 A celebrity instead of a powerful person. 

399
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,780
Sexual violence is prevalent in the film and broadcasting industry.

400
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,210
Our prosecution will root it out.

401
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,670
In the name of the people,

402
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,810
the defendant Nam Seok Hun is accused of habitual sexual violence.

403
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:31,760
A minor role actress, a stylist, and a cast assistant.

404
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,220
Three counts of sexual assault and two counts of indecent assault.

405
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,090
Defendant?

406
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,420
Do you admit to the charges?

407
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,670
I admit it.

408
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,560
 I can't admit it. 

409
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,920
 I made a mistake or two under the influence of alcohol, but 

410
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,500
 sexual assault? 

411
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,230
 A mistake? 

412
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,500
 Yes, Sunbae-nim. 

413
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,770
 If a sunbae says come, you come. 

414
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,890
 Shouldn't we try to figure out how we're going to act? 

415
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,970
 But it's very late right now. Can I see you tomorrow? 

416
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,630
 We're filming tomorrow, what are you talking about?! 

417
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,080
 I'm sorry. 

418
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,560
 I'll come right now. 

419
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,020
 What am I going to do? 

420
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,170
 Is that a mistake, Nam Seok Hun? 

421
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,840
 But I'm telling you she came on to me first. 

422
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,240
 Do you know how many women are trying to catch my eye? 

423
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,150
 I'm also a father raising a daughter. 

424
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,150
 Look at me! A rapist...? 

425
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,490
 It's unbelievable. 

426
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,750
 And frankly, do you have any evidence? 

427
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,880
 Do you have evidence? 

428
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,010
 Technology has improved a lot these days, right? 

429
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,520
 - What? 
 - You hit it with a hammer and threw  it away... 

430
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,080
 Your hard drive. 

431
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,560
 They can restore these things like magic. 

432
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,840
 Well, I can understand one hidden folder. 

433
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,330
 But our national actor has unique tastes. 

434
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,130
 - Prosecutor— 
 - You're a paying member of the VIP room, right? 

435
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,360
 I heard the membership fee is quite expensive, right? 

436
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,980
 That's not it. 

437
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,500
 If your hobby is made public, your family would probably be shocked. 

438
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,590
 Especially your daughter. Don't you think? 

439
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,940
Since the accused has used his power in the entertainment industry to habitually commit sexual violence,

440
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,070
prosecutors are seeking a 20-year prison term

441
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,780
and additionally a treatment

442
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,320
to remove the sexual drive, in order to prevent him from committing such crimes again.

443
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,060
What did you say?

444
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,950
Don't tell me.

445
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,550
An order to remove sexual urges...

446
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,010
Are you talking about chemical castration?

447
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,770
Chemotherapy is expensive and doesn't solve the root problem.

448
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,400
- This is surprising. If so, then the prosecution now— 
 -Yes.

449
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,750
The prosecution requests

450
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,510
physical castration of the defendant.

451
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,950
- What is this, this is different from what we talked about! 
 - Wait a minute.

452
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,910
- Your Honor, this ridiculous— 
 - Animals

453
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,900
don't have human rights.  That is the will of the majority of citizens.

454
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,210
Isn't that right, Your Honor?

455
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,140
That's right!

456
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,560
Chief!

457
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,240
 You want me to gamble like that on my own? 

458
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,390
 It's not gambling, but a homework assignment for Kang Yo Han. 

459
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,810
 Then what if Kang Yo Han really decides that? 

460
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,640
 You saw the reaction earlier when your son's picture came up, right? 

461
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,180
 Nonchalantly imagining it and seeing the real thing is very different.  

462
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,520
 It's a little creepy, just imagining it. 

463
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,820
 Judge Kang knows it well because he's smart. 

464
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,810
 If he opposes it? 

465
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,060
 They'd be disappointed, right? 

466
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,370
 They'll think that Judge Kang Yo Han is no different than the others. 

467
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,670
 The stronger the sentences they expect from him, the easier it will be for them to be disappointed. 

468
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,100
Your Honor.

469
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,130
 It's a difficult assignment. 

470
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,950
Your Honor!

471
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:36,520
I will calmly listen to the defense's arguments the next time.

472
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,650
That's all for today. 
  Live Court Show 

473
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,350
 Coming soon 

474
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,720
 The Times 

475
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,180
 Neutering, the biggest concern of pet owners. What are the reasons for recommending neutering? 

476
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,990
Chief.

477
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,660
- What is this? 
 - This?

478
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,700
This is very good to hold.

479
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,190
It's a 100-year-old German product. Carefully hand-crafted.

480
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,940
Not that. What articles are you looking at?

481
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,770
Are you talking about these articles?

482
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,780
Don't tell me...

483
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,800
I don't know what you're talking about?

484
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,470
- I've always been interested in animals. 
 - Are humans included in those animals?

485
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,870
Don't tell me you imagine me hurting the human sanctity of life?

486
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,460
That's too much.

487
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,560
I’m used to being seen as a monster,

488
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,120
but you looking at me that way, with that face,

489
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,090
hurts my heart.

490
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:27,380
- That's not what I meant. 
   - He wavers if I say it like this. 

491
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,120
- I just— 
 - No,

492
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,480
it may not be a misunderstanding.

493
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,180
Some of us are born monsters.

494
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,500
- Chief! 
 - Some people may be hunting for fun under a pretext of revenge.

495
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,220
Instincts are powerful.

496
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,780
Don't pretend to be strong.

497
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,520
Monsters are better than victims, is that it?

498
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,570
You don't have the courage to admit your own wounds.

499
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,390
Monster?

500
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,270
You do waver if I talk like this.

501
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,400
 Come down! 

502
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,390
 Don't hit me. 

503
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,040
 Don't hit me. 

504
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,910
I am fed up with this house.

505
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,970
- Come here.
 - Hey, don't bother her. Come here.

506
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,830
I did nothing. She came to me, right, Komi?

507
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:09,230
You already even gave her a name? What's Komi?

508
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,080
What? I think she really likes it.

509
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,960
See? I stayed still.

510
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,360
- Komi, come here. Look here.
- She won't go to you.

511
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,860
I did not laugh. Do you have evidence I did? When did I laugh?

512
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,920
- I am going to kill you. 
 - Not again!

513
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:36,600
Come here. Wow! Why?

514
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,960
Come here. Look at her reacting.

515
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,920
You're strong.

516
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,400
Let's see which one of us she'll come to. Come here!

517
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,160
- Come here!
- Come here!

518
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,880
She won't go to you, Elijah.

519
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:05,320
Now go to your eonni.

520
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,850
I told you street cats love me.

521
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,870
You like eonni better, right?

522
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:19,340
Answer, quick.

523
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:48,300
It's been so hard to hear from you since you started staying at Kang Yo Han's.

524
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:53,490
Has it? I mean, I haven't been in the best condition.

525
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:59,110
Okay. Let's grab some food.

526
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,480
The weather's great today.

527
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,180
I agree.

528
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,610
 Speed Quick Service 

529
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:15,220
 The suspension, engine, frame... 

530
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,090
 They're all too much for a delivery service. 

531
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,690
- You want to ride a bike?
- No.

532
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,970
What do you mean? You want to.

533
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:46,820
 - Get on.
- I can take this. 

534
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,790
 You can't– 

535
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,890
 If you cause trouble riding motorcycles again, 

536
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,450
 you and I will be dead at your parents' grave. 

537
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,380
  Hurry and get in. Are you going to walk? 

538
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,430
  Close the trunk. 

539
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,600
  Is he a gangster or what? 

540
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,670
I'll let you on it if I get one.

541
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:04,220
What do you mean, punk?

542
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,410
Lower your voice, we're at the Supreme Court.

543
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,880
Hello.

544
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,940
This punk still hasn't gotten it together.

545
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,710
- You could become an actor.
 - What?

546
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,820
- Please.

547
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:23,720
Hey! It's mine!

548
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,420
We're sorry. I said it's mine!

549
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,930
Hey!

550
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,520
It's this place.

551
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,910
- Give it! 
 - By the looks of it, it will be spicy.

552
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,790
I don't know what went on in that house,

553
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,380
but you are in a position where you cannot be sitting on the fence.

554
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,260
You are already a member of that judicial bench.

555
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,220
You're going to have to choose.

556
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:58,240
To be an accomplice, or a whistleblower.

557
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:06,530
 Choose if you are going to stand in front of me or stand by me. 

558
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,310
And who's the one who pushed me into that situation?

559
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,250
It's already difficult to deal with the things deep-rooted here.

560
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,750
Why do I have to carry the burden of the world?

561
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,260
How sickening.

562
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:31,240
  As the controversy around flogging is spreading, 

563
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,990
 physical castration has become the new hot topic. 

564
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:38,930
That's all they talk about on TV. So nasty.

565
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,920
 Five hits! You shouldn't have taken it. 

566
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,540
Six hits! Don't take it anymore, okay?

567
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,580
- Seven hits!
- That was one of my favorite dolls.

568
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,970
- Eight hits! It hurts, right?

569
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:59,960
Harder!

570
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,660
Good job, good job!

571
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:12,780
More!

572
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,580
What's the matter? We were playing.

573
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:21,060
Please give it. Please give it.

574
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,590
Give  it, please.

575
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,960
Can you not hear me?

576
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,330
Mister?

577
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:38,010
 Bamboo Spear TV 
 Comments: Hi, Hi! Let's run today!, Let's go! Let's do it today too!  

578
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,170
A total change in the Republic of Korea!

579
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:44,560
This Jukchang TV broadcast is to root for Nam Seok Hun's castration.

580
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,590
 Are you all here? Have you all gathered yet? 

581
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,620
 Got your scissors ready? 

582
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,810
That's right.

583
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,530
 Hyeong Yo Han needs to see this. Hyeong, can you see this? 

584
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:03,800
  Do you see our earnest wishes? 

585
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,660
 I say there's no need to watch this trial. 

586
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,130
Why? Because the results are obvious.

587
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,260
Yo Han Hyung will cut it off.

588
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,680
Nam Seok Hun, this piece of trash, a disgrace to men.

589
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,210
Tomorrow,

590
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:26,370
 Judge Kang will gruesomely cut yours off. 

591
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,980
 It must've been so tough. 

592
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,320
 If you're hurt, I am too. 

593
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,050
 Oppa, let's get married! 

594
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:39,890
 Marry me, Oppa! 

595
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:52,950
 We are Kang Yo Han. Kang Yo Han. 

596
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,380
 Kang Yo Han! Kang Yo Han! 

597
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:01,180
Jeez, why do only creeps like him follow me?

598
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:08,020
I've already contacted the mayor and got his permission.

599
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,990
Before we decide to send our inmate to Texas,

600
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:17,060
I need to get some extra information regarding the circumstances and the system of Texas state prisons

601
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:24,820
so if you let me know the direct number of the correctional officer in your state prison, it would be great.

602
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,580
Ajumoni!

603
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,270
Yes, Young Master?

604
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,290
I said you don't need to call me that.

605
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:42,400
I'm sorry but it's too difficult to call you anything else, with that face of yours.

606
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,420
All right.

607
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,760
But what's Elijah doing?

608
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,960
Probably listening to lectures, she's a college student.

609
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,810
It sounded like she was talking to a foreigner.

610
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,050
Because she attends Stanford University.

611
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,370
At that age?

612
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,160
Their bloodline tends to be impatient.

613
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,150
That's not somewhere you can go just because of impatience,

614
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,250
Is she following along well with classes?

615
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:07,660
She's a scholarship student in Computer Engineering, receiving top grades.

616
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,270
They're a genius bloodline.

617
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:16,090
Still, is it possible to get a formal degree taking the classes online from home?

618
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:21,950
Why don't you go ask Young Mater Yo Han or check the school website?

619
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,160
 Stanford
Campus Life
More about Campus 

620
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,370
Huh?

621
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,970
Elijah Hall?

622
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:38,180
Young Master Yo Han has a tendency to not behave rationally when it comes to Young Miss Elijah.

623
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,790
It seems he does.

624
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,850
- More importantly ...
 - Yes?

625
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,900
- Cut it off.
- Cut off what?

626
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,170
What do you mean, what? That bastard's thing. Nam Seok Hun.

627
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:58,830
I wish I could cut it off myself. That son of a bitch.

628
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,470
What will I do?

629
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,690
Even if it's Kang Yo Han, he won't be able to go that far.

630
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:27,850
I admitted to it because that prosecutor punk cowardly threatened me.

631
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:33,010
How did the prosecutor threaten you? Should we expose it?

632
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,830
No.

633
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,120
What do you think the prosecution is thinking?

634
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,840
What else? They want attention.

635
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,700
They'll receive a applause if they just throw it out there first.

636
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,400
- Still, we can't actually–
 - That's not it.

637
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:01,600
That wouldn't be it as a judge, but as a citizen...

638
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,800
I honestly don't know. Why not? He's trash.

639
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,740
I feel the same way, but would that really be all right?

640
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,770
What?

641
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:21,210
Is it really all right? Even if the state holds a knife against one of its citizens?

642
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,030
Would you be fine with allowing that?

643
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,460
Personally,

644
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,950
I feel that this thing called a nation

645
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,690
is just as scary as the criminals.

646
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,740
Prosecutor, a prison sentence is enough punishment.

647
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:43,180
He will spend time as a model prisoner and then apply for parole.Once out, he will do the same thing.

648
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,510
Does that mean someone can be castrated?

649
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:48,400
That's vulgar! It's a treatment upto an extent.

650
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,520
He cannot control his impulses on his own, so isn't the state just offering to treat him?!

651
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,570
Your Honor, that is barbaric!

652
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,980
A criminal has human rights as well–

653
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,140
Judge?

654
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,740
Excuse me,

655
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,870
Judge?

656
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,610
In a country with such low crime rates,

657
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:32,600
a cruel punishment for show instead of education is–

658
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,850
- Where do you live? 
 - Pardon?

659
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,000
Where do you live, Attorney?

660
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,890
I live in an ordinary condo.

661
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,330
Probably somewhere with impenetrable security, right?

662
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:46,070
A place where no one can enter if the door isn't opened, and full of security guards.

663
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:47,520
It is, but...

664
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,380
Attorney. You see, I'm not the brightest person, so I studied for a long time.

665
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,540
- I don't understand. 
 - I did not have a lot of money. So, I mostly lived in cheap hostel rooms.

666
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,280
A place where anyone can come to the door to my bedroom.

667
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,420
You've never received a notice about

668
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,520
a heinous criminal moving into your neighborhood, right?

669
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,160
Not anyone can live in the neighborhood you live in.

670
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,550
I received this kind of notices constantly.

671
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,590
A murder once happened next door too.

672
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:19,300
I've always respected your fight for human rights.

673
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:23,510
But ... a country with low crime rates?

674
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,510
We don't all live in the same country.

675
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:30,370
The country that commoners without money live in

676
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,410
is different from the country you live in.

677
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:39,820
Please consider the rights of those people as well.

678
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,060
Please.

679
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,430
Such inhumane punishment is not good for the country's image either.

680
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:20,900
The defendant here is an influential Hallyu star.

681
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,900
Our country is in a bad state as it is. Do we really have to mete out this sort of a severe punishment?

682
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,740
- I understand. 
 - Excuse me?

683
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,510
- I believe I've heard enough. 
 - Your Honor!

684
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:32,460
I will pass the verdict after a short break.

685
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,600
 Coming soon 

686
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,310
Let's take a short break.

687
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:05,130
Yes, Chief.

688
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:30,740
- ...physical castration of the defendant.
 - Cut it off.

689
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,230
 Neutering, the biggest concern of pet owners. 

690
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:45,290
I will pass the verdict.

691
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,770
Defendant Nam Seok Hun.

692
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,730
Yes.

693
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:57,690
The defendant is sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment.

694
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:02,220
Yes.

695
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,300
 20 years imprisonment 

696
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,100
And...

697
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,430
And?

698
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,910
That is all.

699
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,030
Your Honor!

700
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,970
It will be over for him with just twenty years?

701
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:48,060
That could have been the end for me.

702
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:51,000
Now, let's use some money,

703
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,660
and try to get out on parole quickly.

704
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,760
Oh my belly!

705
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,790
Why is it acting up suddenly?

706
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,010
Gosh, my belly!

707
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,790
Save me!

708
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,250
Help me! Save me!

709
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:26,770
Don't worry, it's just appendicitis. It's a simple operation.

710
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:42,080
Ah, my head.

711
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,910
Excuse me, doctor...I am awake now?

712
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,600
Are you awake? It'll be over soon,

713
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,750
so don't worry.

714
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,200
Wait, why aren't the nurses here?

715
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,980
Why are you alone here, doctor?

716
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,520
I told you not to worry.

717
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:08,290
But, right now,

718
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:11,360
where are you operating?

719
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,570
You really talk a lot.

720
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:25,680
Why do you talk so much?

721
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,400
You really don't know where I am operating?

722
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,890
But you are aware, aren't you?

723
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,330
Don't worry. I will make it pretty down there.

724
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,930
This has been made by German craftsmen.

725
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,910
It's very pretty, isn't it?

726
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,130
I promise I will make it pretty down there.

727
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,770
I will make it pretty down there.

728
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:16,070
What happened? You even had a dream in this short time?

729
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,670
You still don't feel well, do you?

730
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,520
It's time. Let's go.

731
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,790
 Live  Court Show 

732
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:56,940
I put a lot of effort into finding the most appropriate sentence.

733
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,650
Defendant. 
  Defendant - Nam Seok Hun 

734
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,760
Yes.

735
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:05,870
The court was divided and eventually

736
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:09,790
decided to sentence the defendant only to prison.

737
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,000
Your Honor!

738
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,960
But!

739
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:18,120
You will serve your sentence with

740
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,920
those who have the highest expertise in sex crimes.

741
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,530
What do you mean by that?

742
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:24,360
Let's take a look.

743
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:33,700
This is a prison for habitual sex offenders in Texas, USA.

744
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,950
The judiciary of both countries signed a special MOU*.
 (Memorandum of understanding) 

745
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:40,620
From now on, we decided to cooperate with each other on the punishment of sex crimes.

746
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,520
Surrounded by colleagues struggling with the same issues as him,

747
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,720
I hope the defendant will work hard for a long long time.

748
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,770
For 20 years.

749
01:08:55,910 --> 01:09:00,080
 It's all good. 

750
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,540
 We've been waiting for you. 

751
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,010
 Come on, honey. 

752
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:11,090
 Hey, you can speak Korean, I'll be waiting for you.  

753
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:12,800
 "Friends share everything" 

754
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:17,420
I'm not going, I can't go!

755
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:21,420
 Hey sweetie pie, good to see you.

 Prosecutor's seat

01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:33,210

761

762
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:55,160

763
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,490

♫  Whatever makes me write this right   ♫

765
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,670
This is how you solve your homework.

766
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:21,090
Student Kang Yo Han, you know how to surprise your teacher.

767
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,440
You must be in a good mood.

768
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:51,510
It's not bad to be compassionate sometimes, is it?

769
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:52,600
Compassion?

770
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:57,050
Besides that, I heard you had a strange dream?  During the court recess.

771
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:01,490
-Yes. 
 - Wow, what do you think I am?

772
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:05,390
How could I do something like that?

773
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:09,030
Yes, yes, I guess so.

774
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:12,520
But Elijah is sleeping all day.

775
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,170
Let her sleep, since it's Saturday. She probably didn't  sleep much in the last few days

776
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,260
Why?

777
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,820
Who do you think went through all the prisons in the United States to find the right place

778
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:23,520
and was talking to the State Department of Justice with a doctored voice?

779
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,200
What?

780
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,920
Young Master!

Don't tell me, you ...?

01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:27,880
♫  which has lost its light  ♫

795
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:33,150
♫  I can't breathe, I can't breathe  ♫

796
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:35,550
 Threats are meaningless. 

797
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,250
 A report has been received that Judge Kang Yo Han, the presiding judge, 

798
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,550
 provided a large sum of money and valuables. 

799
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,860
 What a waste. 

800
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:45,040
 The public opinion is hasty and cruel. 

801
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:49,300
 The thing with doubt is, once it starts growing, it can't be stopped. 

802
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,480
 Su Hyeon, it's dangerous! 

803
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,470
 The Judge shined the most, twinkle twinkle. 

804
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,980
 If you mess with this child, I won't let you go, whoever that is. 

805
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,940
 What are you doing right now? You're messing with Su Hyeon? Su Hyeon? 

806
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:03,410
 You have nothing to protect? 

807
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:06,640
 There's no such person in the world.
