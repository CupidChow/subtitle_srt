00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,330
 You two, you take the pic. 

59
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,250
 I'll take one more. Please smile!

64
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,870
 Green light. Red light!  

65
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,770
 Green light! Red light! 

66
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,160
 Ga On, stop crying. It's okay. 

67
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,270
 It's all right.  

68
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,420
 It's nothing. 

69
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,610
  Don't cry.  

70
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,870
  I love you.  

71
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,460
  Don't cry.  

72
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,960
 Don't cry, Kim Ga On. 

73
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,970
 Don't cry. 

74
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,130
 Ga On.

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,010

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,730
Su Hyeon...

80
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,960

 Episode 14  

82
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,430
Have you regained consciousness?

83
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,540
The culprit? Did you catch him?

84
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,260
I have to catch that bastard.

85
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,970
Kim Ga On, where are you going?

86
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,750
Let me go. I have to catch that bastard.

87
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,930
Kim Ga On, where are you going?

88
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,110
- Let go of me. 
 - Stop it.

89
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,000
Please.

90
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,940
If you also get killed trying to catch him,

91
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,060
won't Su Hyeon feel sorry for you?

92
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,350
Are you going to get shot in the street and die?

93
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,420
Do you think eonni Su Hyeon wants to see that?

94
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,480
Stay here for now.

95
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,050
While staying here for now,

96
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,460
let's discuss with Yo Han and do something no matter what.

97
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,780
Have you calmed down now?

98
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,780
Who the hell shot Su Hyeon?

99
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,260
They weren't trying to shoot Yun Su Hyeon.

100
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,590
They were trying to get rid of our live court in the midst of the chaos.

101
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,350
Our live court?

102
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,560
Think about what the foundation bastards did.

103
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,600
They stopped the broadcast and completely cut off the electricity in the area.

104
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,960
 - Huh? What the hell!
 - Hey! Turn on the light! 

105
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,980
They were in such a hurry to cover it all up.

106
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,620
But it didn't work, so they tried to kill us.

107
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,170
 No! 

108
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,710
Then did Su Hyeon ...

109
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,470
die ... instead of me?

110
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,010
I know how you feel right now.

111
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,570
It's going to be hell.

112
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,930
The most painful hell from which you can't escape forever.

113
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,190
I know it too,

114
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,040
as I am living in it.

115
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,660
If you have time to cry,

116
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,810
then make those who did this burn in hell's fire.

117
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,530
That's the only way to live in hell.

118
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,150
Did you catch that bastard, Bamboo Spear?

119
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,530
We'll have to start with him first, to get rid of the foundation.

120
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,530
Let's get started. I'm ready.

121
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,250
The government's so-called emergency relief workers

122
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,090
indiscriminately assaulted innocent citizens

123
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,510
and brutally murdered an old man.

124
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:11,010
And a police officer was killed by an unidentified shooter's bullet.

125
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,740
And yet, the government is not revealing the truth.

126
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,920
I will bring this national violence to the live court

127
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,750
and hold everyone involved accountable.

128
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,450
Excuse me, but President Heo Jung Se announced that the live court will be disbanded

129
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,530
and an emergency court will be established.

130
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,900
I will make it clear here.

131
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,880
I have no intention of participating in the so-called emergency court,

132
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,950
that oppresses and controls the citizens.

133
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,760
The trial has already begun.

134
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,720
More than five million people have already voted guilty.

135
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,640
If there's anyone trying to stop this trial,

136
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,090
they ...

137
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,300
are indeed the criminals. 
   Live court determines liability for national violence 

138
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,150
Look at him.

139
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,210
This is outright blackmailing.

140
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,800
He's saying, "if you stop this, it will be a mess."

141
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,810
Anyway, you being crazy about the ratings caused a huge problem.

142
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,020
How are you going to fix this?!

143
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,970
Who knew that Oh Jin Ju would backstab us like that?!

144
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,450
She was very ambitious.

145
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,900
But why is she doing this? She was after the Chief Justice position.

146
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,670
She's going to do it herself.

147
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,910
She's the brightest I've ever seen her. She's shining.

148
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,620
Shining? Is this not your problem?

149
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,220
If all this is revealed, there will be a riot! We will all be stoned to death!

150
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,400
Tell them to kill us.

151
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,390
- Let them do the trial. 
 - What?!

152
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,960
We can't do that!

153
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,620
Let's muffle the press first and put pressure on the Supreme Court–

154
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,690
The whole nation watched it live!

155
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,280
An old man was beaten to death with an iron pipe!

156
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,700
It's too dangerous. We can't do that.

157
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,970
First of all, for now...

158
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,750
We have to cut the tail first.

159
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:25,740
This situation in which some front line personnel were over-zealous and performed competitively,

160
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,590
is a regrettable tragedy.

161
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:35,630
I apologize, on behalf of the government, to the deceased and their bereaved families.

162
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,670
However, this should not be an opportunity to spread groundless conspiracy theories

163
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:53,040
and slander emergency quarantine and emergency relief measures.

164
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,900
However, if anything like that happens in the course of this trial,

165
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:05,570
it is clearly treason against the nation!

166
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,570
Good work.

167
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,200
The problem

168
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,430
isn't the old man beaten to death.

169
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,080
The key is the virus.

170
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,350
We should prepare ourselves.

171
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,960
What do you mean by that?

172
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,710
There's a lot of talk about whether or not there is or isn't a virus.

173
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,660
Fine, let's give it to them then. As long as they get the virus, right?

174
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,810
Everything will be okay just if a virus be detected in a very poor neighborhood, right?

175
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:52,560
Don't tell me you are going to spread a virus?

176
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,450
Yes, if I need to, I will.

177
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,150
Sometimes, when you're a leader,

178
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,340
you have to take a solitary decision

179
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,600
to sacrifice the minority for the sake of the majority

180
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,160
while shedding tears of blood. Such a moment could come for me too.

181
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,260
Why? When you see Hollywood movies,

182
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,480
they pray like this and press the nuclear button! Bang!

183
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,830
Is something wrong? Do you have any complaints?

184
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,950
No, I'm impressed.

185
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,710
Your tone is sarcastic, Chairwoman Jeong. It seems you don't like what I'm doing.

186
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,770
What? Are you going to back out?

187
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,360
That's a foul! You can't do that!

188
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,800
That's not it. What? Do you still have a lingering attachment to Kang Yo Han?

189
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,180
I will take care of Kang Yo Han.

190
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,140
You just shut that guy's mouth.

191
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,480
Who?

192
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,400
The one who created this trouble by beating an old man to death,

193
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,350
the President's fan club president, Bamboo Spear.

194
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,150
Don't tell me you still have some sort of lingering attachment to him?

195
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,880
We've already brought him to trial so we have to reveal the truth in court.

196
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,820
We have even to reveal there wasn't a virus.  Do you think it's possible?

197
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,410
Attorney Go In Guk is contacting a researcher at the emergency relief headquarters.

198
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,580
We're meeting later.

199
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,050
Do you want to come with me to the meeting?

200
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,310
Yes, let's do that.

201
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,850
Wait a minute.

202
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,420
Did you have dinner?

203
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,520
I just don't feel like eating.

204
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,920
- Wait a minute. 
 - Yes?

205
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm hungry, so I'm going to cook ramen.

206
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,860
Should I make one more portion?

207
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,700
Thank you. But not today, some other time.

208
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,660
Ga On.

209
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,460
You're here.

210
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,230
What are you listening to?

211
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,940
Just ...

212
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,990
music.

213
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,460
Listen to something bright. Don't be so gloomy.

214
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,440
Did you eat?

215
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm thinking of making some ramen.

216
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,820
You two are alike.

217
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,230
What are you talking about? Who am I like?

218
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,780
Your uncle.

219
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,500
What the hell? How am I like that ajeossi?

220
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,120
You both are awkward at consoling.

221
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,130
What do you mean consoling?

222
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,590
It's just that I don't want to see you like that.

223
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,370
Acting like you're done living life.

224
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,590
It's not fun.

225
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,000
But it consoles me

226
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,600
because it's awkward.

227
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,610
Thank you, Elijah.

228
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,570
Whatever.

229
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,280
 Do you want to marry me? I love you. 

230
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,900
 No, I'm just joking. I love you just a little. 

231
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,740
 Do you want to marry me? I love you. 

232
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,320
 No, I'm just joking. I love you just a little. 

233
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,110
 There's a lot of talk about whether or not there is or isn't a virus. 

234
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,590
 Fine, we'll give it to them then. 

235
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:28,190
 Everything will be okay just if a virus be detected from a very poor neighborhood, right? 

236
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,890
That son of a bitch is a crazy clown.

237
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,020
 Yes, Eonni? 

238
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,950
You know the neighborhood I used to live in, right?

239
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,020
Is it also an emergency quarantine area?

240
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,410
Yes, probably. It's a very poor neighborhood.

241
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,470
Right, it would be.

242
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,900
You know that youth welfare center I mentored at before, do you know if that place is also?

243
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,500
 No. That is a foundation welfare center. 

244
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,530
I think they excluded that place.  Do you want to me to check it out?

245
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,450
No, just wondering.

246
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,000
 I guess this was my mother's wish. 

247
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,440
 For me to grow up to be ordinary and kind. 

248
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,690
 Then why would she do this? 

249
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:41,510
 Why would she beat me up whenever she got drunk? 

250
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,270
 - My mom did the same thing. 
 - Is that so? 

251
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,850
 Normally, she is nice like an angel. 

252
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,990
 But when she starts drinking, 

253
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,950
 she starts crying and she— 

254
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,250
 Oh, I can't get used to this. 

255
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,880
Eonni, are you in menopause? You're worried about other people.

256
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,880
Hey! I worry about you so much–

257
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,820
You always make me do all the dangerous things, what do you mean you worry?

258
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,830
 Eonni, we're in a business relationship. 

259
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,770
 Just take care of my hazard pay. 

260
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,620
You heartless rude bitch. I'm hanging up!

261
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,860
How did I get here?

262
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,790
What can I do? I'm already here.

263
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,210
I'm glad you came to see us, Doctor.

264
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,430
Judge Kang.

265
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,900
I am Kim Ga On.

266
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,050
It's nice to meet you, Judge Kim.

267
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,500
I'm going to be straightforward.

268
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,070
Is it true that a virus variant has been discovered?

269
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,930
I have yet to see any scientific evidence.

270
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,260
Haven't you been a member of the epidemic response team for three years?

271
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,800
Does that mean you haven't seen anything like that?

272
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,090
A month ago, the Blue House suddenly replaced the researchers.

273
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,000
All the key data are labelled as classified and don't even show up.

274
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,330
The emergency response headquarters is in complete panic right now.

275
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,400
Armed soldiers are in control of everything.

276
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,260
Are you saying you've never seen a sample of the detected virus?

277
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,430
Right. I only stole a glance at the autopsy data of the deceased,

278
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,060
but there is no significant commonality of the symptoms.

279
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,860
It is difficult to have so many different symptoms from a single virus.

280
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,690
If there's only one thing in common...

281
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,970
What would that be?

282
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,970
It's malnutrition.

283
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,720
Malnutrition?

284
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,210
Most of the dead are homeless elderly people.

285
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,930
The places where the virus is now being discovered are all extremely poor communities,

286
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,520
and it's not the virus that killed them, but it's poverty.

287
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,900
People with malnutrition and poor hygiene,

288
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,370
suffer from various chronic diseases and are dying for various reasons.

289
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:12,400
They turn this into the case of a deadly virus circulating in certain areas and people are being cleansed.

290
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,950
That's the nature of this situation.

291
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:23,800
Doctor, can you testify in court what you just said?

292
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
Yes, Judge.

293
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,440
It's dangerous. You know that, right?

294
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,140
I've made up my mind.

295
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,850
 Supreme Court of Korea 
 Trial of the emergency relief site death case to begin soon 

296
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,460
 While public access to the Supreme Court is prohibited to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, 

297
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,370
 an active colonel, who is the judicial office director for the presidential emergency response headquarters, 

298
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,450
  has been appointed as the defense attorney. It is drawing attention. 

299
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,350
 Attention is focused on whether the truth of the incident, which has attracted the attention of the whole nation,  

300
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,530
 can be revealed. 

301
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,170
This is a very unfortunate accident.

302
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,940
Did you just say it was an accident, Attorney?

303
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,430
 Kang Yo Han! Come down! 

304
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:18,550
 Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down! 

305
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,540
Please answer again.

306
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,500
Is this an accident, Lawyer?

307
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,280
Yes, it's an accident.

308
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,730
Don't we have to look at the context before and after the incident?

309
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,710
Right. Let's talk about the context in which an old man in his 70s

310
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,350
was murdered by being hit with an iron pipe, Attorney.

311
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,480
It's a war-like situation in Korea right now.

312
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,320
To prevent the spread of the deadly variant strain of the virus,

313
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,750
field agents risk their lives to be deployed to dangerous sites.

314
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,950
This incident is nothing more than an accidental death that occurred

315
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,940
in a situation where residents resisted and

316
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,170
did not comply with the emergency evacuation order.

317
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,000
Is this the normal execution of official duty that you just described, Attorney?

318
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,560
Again, this is a war situation.

319
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,470
While we leisurely argue over human rights and procedures,

320
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,120
if the virus spreads across the country, who will be responsible for it?

321
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,050
Are you going to take responsibility, Your Honor?

322
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,480
All right.

323
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,520
Then let's first check if there is indeed a war situation,

324
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,480
as the Attorney has been repeatedly emphasizing.

325
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,390
Regarding the variant strain of the virus that was discovered this time,

326
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,890
we will call a witness at the discretion of the court, to confirm the facts.

327
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,260
By all means.

328
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,100
Witness Yun Myeong Jin.

329
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,730
Witness Yun Myeong Jin!

330
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,530
Witness Yun Myeong Jin!

331
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,360
Witness Yun Myeong Jin!

332
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,950
If you are looking for Dr. Yun Myeong Jin

333
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:19,020
from our Emergency Response Headquarters,

334
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,580
unfortunately he passed away this morning.

335
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,520
He was infected while he was treating a patient with a variant of the virus,

336
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,920
and after 12 hours of infection—

337
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,080
 May he rest in peace. 

338
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,660
Dr. Yun's noble sacrifice

339
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,520
is evidence of what the current situation is.

340
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,750
Respectfully, Your Honor.

341
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,560
As expected, the beauty of legal proceedings is that they have to create suspense,

342
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,420
be bloody, and have a twist.

343
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,450
Don't you think?

344
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,180
The people who killed Su Hyeon also killed Dr. Yun.

345
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,360
Calm down, Judge Kim.

346
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,530
What do we do, Chief?

347
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:25,250
Now that this has happened, it seems that there is no other way than to make Kim Chung Sik talk.

348
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,120
We have to make him talk, whatever it takes.

349
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,040
There's something I've prepared.

350
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,040
Just watch it but don't say anything.

351
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,890
Excuse me?

352
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,230
All right.

353
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,940
So Attorney, what punishment is appropriate?

354
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,450
It's an accidental crime that occurred in a situation of emergency.

355
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:00,040
And the defendant is a young man who has been struggling in a difficult environment and is currently jobless.

356
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,840
Above all, considering that the defendant sincerely repents for his sins,

357
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,110
I ask that you be as lenient as possible.

358
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,490
What's the prosecution's opinion?

359
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,850
Considering all the circumstances,

360
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,020
I seek a seven year prison sentence.

361
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,580
I see.

362
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,180
I thank both of you for your opinions.

363
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,550
Now I'm going to ask the defendant. Defendant?

364
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,490
Ah, yes.

365
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,780
 Show- Show him to the camera. 

366
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,990
 This loser's mugshot. Smile as much as you can, while you still can, you punk. 

367
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,760
You were a filming staff member when President Heo Jung Se was a political Internet broadcaster, right?

368
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,940
You were also the president of his fan club.

369
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,430
 Your Honor, what does that have to do with this trial now? 

370
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,530
You were also an unofficial campaigner during the presidential election. Isn't that right?

371
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,280
No, I don't know anything about that.

372
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,370
It was your job, but you don't know?

373
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,920
No.

374
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,900
That's interesting.

375
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,220
You used to wield an iron pipe quite a bit back then, didn't you?

376
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,690
Didn't you and your colleagues intervene in peaceful demonstrations,

377
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,280
engage in violence, and loot stores?

378
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,980
   

379
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,760
   

380
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,450
I think you contributed to the election of President Heo Jung Se,

381
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,950
who would stabilize society with a strong law and order.

382
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,900
Is that not true?

383
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,640
He tries to make this trial become a bigger issue, right?

384
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,300
The old man's death is an excuse.

385
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,510
He's going to overthrow the government!

386
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,060
That disgusting bastard!

387
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,450
No. It was my decision, but it was a drunken mistake.

388
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,470
Is that right? Then is it also a mistake to have an iron pipe

389
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,900
at the emergency relief site this time? Or ...

390
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,400
did someone order you to drag everyone out of there?

391
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,580
I've never been ordered to do anything. It was my decision.

392
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:18,090
- You were also a popular internet broadcaster, right? 
 - Yes.

393
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,730
The defendant's fans, who were jobless and poor young people,

394
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,000
were gathered and deployed into the site. Who did that?

395
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,970
I was never ordered to do that.

396
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,840
I'm just trying to help them make some money because they seem to be in a difficult situation–

397
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,660
 Dear beloved and respected citizens. Who's going to make a safe Korea? 

398
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,730
 You can't just trust the police. 

399
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,850
 We are the owners, so we will have to make Korea safe. 

400
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,290
Shortly after President Heo Jung Se's broadcast,

401
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,270
the defendant gathered youths without jobs,

402
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,050
and began to use violence against foreign workers.

403
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,000
And the same young people were now deployed to the site.

404
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,730
But you didn't get any orders to do so.

405
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,750
Yes. I did it because I love my country, Your Honor.

406
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,080
After all, as a citizen,

407
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,890
I deeply sympathized with the President's political philosophy,

408
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,090
so I stood up for it.

409
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,980
Is that a crime?!

410
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,560
How is that a crime? Huh?

411
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,440
So, it was all done by you.

412
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,760
- Yes. 
 - It's what you did, and it's your responsibility.

413
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,710
- Yes. 
 - All right.

414
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:40,380
Attorney, do you agree with the president's political philosophy, like the defendant?

415
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,700
Of course. In times of crisis, we need to empower our leaders.

416
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,710
Then we already have our answer.

417
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,990
The president already knows the answer

418
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:53,360
to the proper punishment for the defendant.

419
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,050
 What do we need to do to make Korea 

420
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,150
 a strong and  proper country? 

421
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,990
 Yes, a four character idiom. 

422
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,190
 Ex - e - cu - tion. Ba-ra-ra-bam-bam-bam! 

423
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,150
 Execution! These criminals, that are like garbage insects, 

424
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:15,120
 why do we need to feed them and give them housing with the taxpayer's money? 

425
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,890
 It's all because of the hypocrites who talk about human rights. 

426
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,030
 I mean, just 10 or 20 years in prison for killing someone, 

427
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,320
 does this ... does this make any sense? 

428
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,800
 In Heo Jung Se's "Refreshing Vlog!" this is absolutely not acceptable. 

429
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,730
 Listen carefully. 

430
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,830
 The price of taking a person's life must be repaid with one's own life, right? 

431
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,940
 You know what I mean, right? Do you understand? 

432
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,820
 Eye, eye, tooth, tooth. Today's second four character idiom. 

433
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,030
 An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.  

434
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,300
 Also ... "They grew up in some unfortunate environment." 

435
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
 "It's because of the trauma of being abused."  

436
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,700
 These cheap, tear-jerking attorneys, have to be all caught and put in jail.  

437
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,290
 Strong law and order! 

438
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:06,020
 A strong country! 

439
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,700
Hit the enemy with the enemy's sword.

440
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,930
 The great Korea— 

441
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,190
 What Kang Yo Han really wants ... 

442
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:23,250
 Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down! Come down! Come– 

443
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,730
Everything was your own decision. You didn't receive any orders.

444
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,310
If you wish to take responsibility by yourself, please do so.

445
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,970
However ...

446
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,120
The cost of a life is a life!

447
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,200
- I propose the death penalty as the most appropriate punishment for this case! 
 - Your Honor!

448
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,750
It's out of the question. In practice, we have never sentenced a person to death for the death of one person.

449
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,920
Is one person not enough?

450
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,660
Do we have to wait until the defendant kills two, three, or four people?

451
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,930
Is the killer's life worth more than the victim's life?

452
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,270
The defendant is in difficult circumstances—

453
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:24,110
If it's a cheap emotional excuse, put it away.

454
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,600
Not everyone commits a crime just because they are in difficult circumstances.

455
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,980
This court will treat all criminals equally.

456
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,550
Human beings are dignified because they take responsibility.

457
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,650
Cheap sympathy is an insult to humans.

458
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,780
Dear citizens, what is the proper punishment for a murderer?

459
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,560
How do you pay back the blood the victim shed?

460
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:12,470
 National Voting Status 
 7,101,188 
 85% 

461
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,510
 Death Penalty 
 For - 75.7% 
 Against - 24.3% 

462
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,190
Thank you. The citizens' desire for justice

463
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,540
should not be limited to just words.

464
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,020
Unenforced punishment is not justice, but fraud.

465
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,250
I demand justice with...!

466
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,020
An electric chair.

467
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,920
The death penalty will be executed 24 hours from now.

468
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,640
Right here.

469
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,430
I did wrong.

470
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,230
 What is your choice? 

471
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,180
Citizens, fulfill justice with your own hands.

472
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,460
The more of you that press the button,

473
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,750
the more current will flow through the prisoner's body.

474
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,770
More than a million people have to press the button to kill the death row criminal!

475
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,490
I'll see you tomorrow.

476
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,490
Your Honor... Your–

477
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,820
Your Honor! Your Honor! Excuse me!

478
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,720
Your Honor! Your Honor!

479
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,910
Are they going to turn the court into a slaughterhouse or what?!

480
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
What are they doing now?!

481
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,920
That's what Kang Yo Han really wants. Fear.

482
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,220
That's why he gave him 24 hours.

483
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,600
He's trying to scare him and make him blow everything up

484
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,100
in front of the entire nation.

485
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,300
Wow, that.. that cruel bastard.

486
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,590
How could he do that as a human being— Ah, really!

487
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,920
What are you going to do, Mr. President?

488
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,410
You need to stop that man from talking.

489
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,130
We have to get rid of him now! Send someone to the detention center.

490
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,650
Park Du Man! Why don't you just advertise that we were the ones who gave the order?! Advertise it!

491
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,710
- Then what do you want me to do?! 
 - I will...

492
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:10,470
- I will stop him from talking. Yes. 
 - How are you going to do that?

493
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,480
I know that kind of bastard really well.

494
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,330
Don't worry. I'm– I'm Heo Jung Se.

495
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,790
I am! I am!

496
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:25,000
Trust me. I will take care of it.

497
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,630
Chief, I don't think this is right.

498
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,720
No matter how much I think about it, I don't think this is right.

499
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,670
Then what should we do? Is there an alternative?

500
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,860
Are you trying to make Kim Chung Sik talk by doing such a thing?

501
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,170
Making him sit in the electric chair and  using the citizens as well?

502
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:51,080
I just asked the question and the citizens gave the answer.

503
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,810
You saw that the overwhelming majority agree.

504
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,120
Isn't that democracy?

505
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,660
Then how are you any different from Heo Jung Se?

506
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,030
If you really want to oppose it, get out of the courtroom.

507
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,140
Chief!

508
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,150
Judge Kim, say something.

509
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:26,930
Judge Kim, have you seen the news?

510
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,290
 Strongly opposed to the death penalty demanded by the Judge Kang Yo Han, 

511
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:39,460
 Supreme Court Justice Min Jeong Ho has just offered to resign. 

512
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,890
 This is not a punishment, it's barbaric! 

513
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:49,630
 I'm leaving the Supreme Court, 

514
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,090
 tainted by a mad agitator. 

515
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,370
Professor.

516
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,010
Ga On.

517
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,320
You have to stop him.

518
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,920
You can't tolerate this.

519
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,900
Kang Yo Han, that man, is the devil.

520
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,330
He turned the whole nation into murderers.

521
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,940
I think he's trying to make Kim Chung Sik talk, that's why he purposefully–

522
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,750
So?

523
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,800
The citizens, themselves, are going to torture him with electricity?! And do it at the Supreme Courthouse?

524
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,620
Don't believe what he says.

525
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,250
That snake-like man is playing tricks on the world,

526
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,110
using the weakest part of a person.

527
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:04,730
But Professor, the people in power are hurting innocent people.

528
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,960
- Su Hyeon was also killed by them– 
 - Are you sure?

529
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,200
- What? 
 - Are you certain who killed Su Hyeon?

530
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,220
Who do you think tried to shoot at our justice department?

531
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,050
- If you think about the situation– 
 - Yes.

532
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,760
That's what I thought at first too. But you know what?

533
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,800
There was one thing that kept bothering me.

534
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,860
Su Hyeon came to me a while ago.

535
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,280
At that time, Su Hyeon...

536
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,360
 Is something going on? 

537
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,490
 Is it about Ga On? 

538
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,920
She thought you were being deceived by Kang Yo Han.

539
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,690
Su Hyeon didn't like Kang Yo Han from the beginning.

540
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,990
It's not like that. Su Hyeon was

541
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,120
tracking Kang Yo Han's past.

542
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,990
About the church fire incident.

543
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,710
That incident?

544
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,860
You know well that Su Hyeon is persistent.

545
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,350
Whenever she had time, she went to that neighborhood

546
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:28,720
and asked around about people related to that church.

547
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,690
But there was only one person

548
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,220
she couldn't find, a man named Joseph.

549
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,650
As if someone deliberately took him away.

550
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,450
Who is he?

551
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:45,200
A man who ate, slept, and did all sorts of chores at the church.

552
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,500
I heard that his work included

553
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,650
the management of the CCTV.

554
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,710
Su Hyeon was chasing after him.

555
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:00,360
But what if Su Hyeon finally found him?

556
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,430
And what if Kang Yo Han found out about it?

557
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,650
But that's just an assumption.

558
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,920
Kang Yo Han killed his own brother?

559
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,780
Do you know how much Kang Yo Han is suffering from that? That! ...

560
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,800
Was a terrible agony, that could never be just an act.

561
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,850
That agony,

562
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,870
what if it's guilt?

563
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,390
What if that is the reason he is desperately trying to hide his past?

564
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:36,530
What if Su Hyeon was digging into it?

565
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,590
Please stop.

566
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,340
I'll be going now.

567
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,840
Let me ask you one thing.

568
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,300
If Su Hyeon were to see you killing someone using an electric chair

569
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,510
with Kang Yo Han,

570
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,130
what do you think she'd say?

571
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,710
 That doesn't mean a judge can do weird stuff as Kang Yo Han did. 

572
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,480
 The little you've seen and heard is strange enough. 

573
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,400
 A foul is a foul. And that's also a crime. 

574
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,290
 And you can't be mistaken. 

575
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,690
  Mistaken?  

576
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:58,730
  Whether Kang Yo Han has a situation or not, it doesn't make a difference.  

577
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,850
 Who doesn't have a situation? 

578
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:05,150
 But not everyone is breaking the law. 

579
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,540
 If Su Hyeon 

580
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,610
 were to see you killing someone using the electric chair with Kang Yo Han, 

581
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,390
 what do you think she'd say? 

582
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,890
 Ga On... What are you doing right now? 

583
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,910
 Why are you here? 

584
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,920
 - Su Hyeon— 
 - I asked you what you're doing here! 

585
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:58,360
 Do you know what I had to do because of you? 

586
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,580
 I got rid of the evidence... the evidence. 

587
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:07,480
 How could you do such a terrible thing? How could you? 

588
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:37,760
What am I supposed to do, Grandfather...

589
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,420
I really didn't think you would die.

590
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:46,150
No, they're going to save me.

591
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,800
I'm so precious to them.

592
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,450
They're not going to get rid of me like this.

593
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,820
They won't.

594
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,690
What— What is it?
  Correction 

595
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,120
Let go! 
  Correction 

596
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,260
Let go! No, no!

597
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,220
- Hold him. 
 - Yes.

598
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,950
Your Excellency.

599
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,970
 "Beyond Good and Evil"
 (by Friedrich Nietzsche) 

600
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:57,040
Are you really going to do this?

601
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,120
Is there a reason to stop?

602
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:06,430
The people who committed the crime are evil, but why would you punish innocent citizens?

603
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:11,240
- Punishing? 
 - Making people kill someone with their own hands in broad daylight ...

604
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,900
You're saying that's not a punishment?

605
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,830
Is it all right to kill with someone else's hands?

606
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,870
I don't believe in cheap justice where people sit comfortably in the corner of the room and just shout words.

607
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:29,260
Without getting a drop of blood on their hands, asking someone else to fight evil for them.

608
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,080
That's just an accomplice.

609
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,830
In this world, there is no such thing as a human being with  no sins.

610
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,200
No. That's not true.

611
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,910
There are far more people in the world who can't stand up to fight,

612
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:43,860
but they work hard without harming others.

613
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,010
Some people risk their life to protect the world.

614
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,770
Someone like Dr. Yun Myeong Jin and

615
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,030
a police officer like Su Hyeon.

616
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,570
A world where everyone's hands are covered in blood is just hell.

617
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:08,460
You're trying to make the world hell now.

618
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,920
The world I was born into has always been hell.

619
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,840
Can't you please stop?

620
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:19,420
I don't want to see you do something you can't turn back from.

621
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,020
To me,

622
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,540
there is no other choice.

623
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,080
Can I ask you something?

624
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,300
- What is it? 
 - When we went out to the site of forced relocation,

625
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,630
did you know that if the residents collided with the Bamboo Spear unit,

626
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,160
there could be victims?

627
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,400
 Everyone, even at this moment, your neighbors are dying. 

628
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,340
 Are you just going to watch? 

629
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,770
 Just take my stone! 

630
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:03,760
- Chief. 
 - The judge was hit by a stone.

631
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,270
 - Was he badly hurt? 
 -Judge! 

632
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,160
 Hey, you! You will be punished by Heaven! 

633
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,410
 Kang Yo Han! 

634
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,320
 Come... down! Come down! 

635
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,480
 Come down! Come down! Come down! 

636
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,830
Didn't you actually plan that?

637
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,460
To make people fight,

638
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,600
you need the blood of a victim.

639
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,930
Is that so, really?

640
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:07,590
If you have time to ask questions, take action instead.

641

 HMBN Live 
 Defendant Kim Chung Sik 
 Capital punishment involving the entire nation. 

642
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:12,130
Now the announced time has come. Please get ready.

643
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:25,270
Are you really going to take full responsibility alone?

644
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,650
Are you sure you didn't take orders from anyone?

645
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,690
That's right. Why do you keep asking?

646
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,920
You devil bastard.

647
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:39,670
All right. Dear citizens, please execute the sentence.

648

 Number of Participants 

649
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:11,000
Is this amusing to you?

650
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,760
I'm not going to die. Why should I die?

651
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,450
I haven't done anything wrong.

652
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:04,920
  You really are a real patriot and you're going through such hardship. 

653
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,140
  You've gone through so much, really. 

654
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,340
 Sit, sit. 

655
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:20,020
  You're a man and yet you're crying like this? 

656
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:23,270
  Did you think I would abandon you? It's me, Heo Joong Se. 

657
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:26,850
  No, of course not. I completely trusted you. 

658
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,910
  Yes, you just need to trust me. 

659
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:36,100
  You just continue to trust me until the end. 

660
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,750
  Tomorrow, I want you to sit on that chair. 

661
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,490
  - What? 
 - Kang Yo Han, that bastard, is putting on a show! 

662
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:47,490
  He's putting on a threatening show until my name comes out of your mouth! 

663
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,710
  But still...you're asking me to die. 

664
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,860
  Don't be scared, don't be scared. 

665
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:56,060
  Just...endure it. 

666
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,990
  If, for whatever reason, I think you're in actual danger, 

667
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:03,120
  I'll stop it for you. Even if I need to cut out all the electricity at the Supreme Court, 

668
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,560
  I'll save you, so don't worry. 

669
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,650
  This is all for our country. 

670
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,750
  Your lifelong wish. I told you hundreds, thousands 

671
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:17,350
  of times, I'll fulfill your wish. For real! 

672
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,600
  Really? 

673
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,000
  Things you've dreamt of your whole life. 

674
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,950
  An apartment with a view of the Han River. 

675
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,660
  Being a full-time worker at a government-owned company. 

676
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:32,360
 In addition, I'll just give Bitcoin to you! 

677
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,880
Thank you!

678
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,020
Oh, you brave bastard.

679
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:46,620
  Yes, yes. 

680
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,800
Who are you to kill me?

681
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,550
Go ahead and try.

682
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,580
 Number of Participants 

683
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:18,070
Everyone..

684
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:20,520
you are this country's owner.

685
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,740
An owner ... is someone who takes responsibility.

686
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:27,620
Because you take responsibility is why you are the owner.

687
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,050
Everyone..

688
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:32,490
Please become this country's owner.

689
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:38,360
"Please become this country's owner..."

690
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:43,620
What a load of nonsense.

691
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,760
They let this kind of person alone?

692
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,500
Still...it's awful.

693
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,310
How can I kill a living person with my own hands?

694
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:58,190
Do you think a person who's killed someone won't kill again?

695
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:01,760
He's the type of guy who's been doing all bad things since the past.

696
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,420
You have to vote.

697
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,550
- Let's all vote. 
 - Should we?

698
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,120
 Your Choice? 
  Yes. 

699
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,480
  Number of Participants 

700
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:18,370
Wow. It's real.

701
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:21,140
Oh, they really are coming.

702
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,190
 Your Choice? 
  Yes. 

703
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,970
Oh, it really works.

704
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,810
It does? It worked because you pressed it, right?

705
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:33,450
Yes, it really works. I was doubting it really worked.

706
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:35,030
Really?

707
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:37,290
Should I try it too?

708
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,850
This bad bastard!

709
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:41,970
Okay, the law is the law.

710
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,770
It's only right to press it.

711
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:48,920
This really works, though.

712
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,820
This is pretty cool.

713
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,500
  Number of Participants 

714
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,330
Oh, I can endure it.

715
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,360
I'm okay.

716
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,700
He told me to endure it.

717
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:09,790
  Number of Participants 

718
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:13,660
Wow...

719
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,470
Press it.

720
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:26,100
- Okay, I'm pressing it. 
 - No.

721
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:31,270
I should endure it, endure. I should.

722
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,610
Oh, he is enduring.

723
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:37,160
Okay!

724
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,610
Hey, hey! Electricity!

725
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,910
Kids!

726
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:03,980
- Press it. 
 - Oh!

727
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,680
No, no!

728
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,370
Huh?

729
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,500
Oh, no.

730
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,980
He told me to endure it.

731
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:13,400
Judge, the judicial council

732
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,210
made a call for a suspension of execution.

733
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:18,010
Who did this?

734
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:21,810
Judge Kim Ga On held a press conference a short while ago.

735
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,560
The live trial...

736
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,060
is all

737
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,360
manipulated.

♫  I think about your eyes  ♫

742
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:44,190
 I am a criminal.  

743
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,910
  Are you afraid of me?  

744
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,880
  You don't want to be a monster like me? 

745
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,400
 You're just the clown I placed as a figurehead in this position.  

746
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,610
  Kang Yo Han for president!  

747
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:55,080
  What are you going to do about this? 

748
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,070
  How lucky. 

749
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:57,980
  It's the last thing Su Hyeon left behind. 

750
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,420
  It's time for you to know the truth now. 

751
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,190
  I clearly saw.  

752
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,080
  Did you meet Joseph? 

753
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:08,020
  This is what the Young Master tried to hide so frantically. 

754
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:11,630
  You're going to regret this... your whole life.
