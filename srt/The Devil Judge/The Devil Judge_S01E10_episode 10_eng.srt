 Ji Sung

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,420
 Kim Min Jung

00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,470
 Jin Young

00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,720
 Park Gyu Young

 NO JUSTICE

 Devil Judge

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,450
 This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea.  All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional. 

9
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,550
  Episode 10 

10
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,900
My money!

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,120
Chief!

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,700
Chief!

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,880
There are people in there!

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,100
- Don't do it! 
  - Spare us!

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,440
Chief! Kang Yo Han!

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,840
Stop! Stop!

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,110
I'm just giving him an opportunity.

18
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
- Spare them, please. 
 - Don't do it!

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,820
- Don't do it! 
 - Don't do it! No!

20
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,580
Honey! Honey, save us!

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,070
Help!

22
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,940
Let go! Let go!

23
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,560
Calm down and watch him!

24
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,830
My money!

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,690
- My money! 
 - Honey, save us!

26
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,930
What is this? It's all fake!

27
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,310
It's not my money.

28
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,790
It isn't my money!

29
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,840
- We have to save them! 
 - Calm down.

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,040
Look at who he really is.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,690
I mean, this is...

32
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,690
He even lied to his family.

33
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,510
He told them he didn't have any money left.

34
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,760
Seo Jin. Dad had no other choice. Seo Jin, I... Seo Jin...

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,880
Honey... Honey, I'll explain...

36
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,350
Damn!

37
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,010
Don't go, damn it! Don't go!

38
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,800
Now, if you want revenge, do it. Don't hesitate.

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,110
Please spare me.

40
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,250
I was wrong. Please spare me.

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,950
Spare me.

42
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,990
Please spare me. Please. Please.

43
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,930
My money... my money...my money!

44
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,150
He's the only bait if we want to catch Cha Gyeong Hui, isn't he?

45
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,940
Let's not waste it.

46
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,370
Are you having fun?

47
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm not sure... I don't know how to do anything else with cards.

48
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
- You don't know? 
 - No.

49
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,950
You haven't played card games before?

50
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,880
Whom would I play with?

51
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,990
Well, of course, your family—

52
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,550
Or your friends...

53
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,650
I'm sorry, I'm saying useless things again.

54
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,760
Are you being nosey again?

55
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,450
Don't jump to conclusions. I just don't like getting along with people.

56
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,150
Besides that,

57
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,680
I was grateful that you let me catch Do Yeong Chun.

58
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,180
You shouldn't be. We've only built the second floor.

59
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,320
The second floor?

60
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,670
We passed Cha Gyeong Hui's secretary and caught Do Yeong Chun.

61
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,930
Now, we have to move onto the next step.

62
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,350
If we pass Cha Gyeong Hui, is Heo Jung Se next? Where is the end?

63
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,470
I'm not sure, it depends on how many floors the house is being built to.

64
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,650
I think it's more fun to destroy the whole thing.

65
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,330
You really thought I'd topple it, didn't you?

66
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,400
Did you find out who was behind the Bamboo Spear? It looks like you were digging really hard.

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,600
Yes. The start of the Bamboo Spears' assaults coincided with when

68
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,820
Heo Jung Se instigated his followers to take to the streets.

69
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,940
 You can't just trust the police. 

70
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,880
 We are the owners, so we will have to make Korea safe. 

71
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,700
 Tonight, we're going to become the real masters. 

72
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,780
And anything else?

73
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,340
- Butler? 
  - Yes. 

74
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,800
Can you turn on episode 86 of Heo Jung Se's personal broadcast?

75
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,350
The second week of September four years ago.

76
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,150
 Yes. 

77
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,410
The two of you have become friends.

78
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,000
 Korea's Total Change! Heo Jung Se's 'So Refreshing!' 

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,050
 Hello, I'm Do Yeon Jeong. 

80
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,500
 Hey, It's Heo Jung Se.  My beloved and respected viewers.  

81
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,640
 The reason why you're all unemployed, losers, 

82
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,260
 just why you can't even once date a pretty girl as I do, 

83
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,330
 the reason why you're all living so pathetically ... 

84
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,050
 I will tell you the real reason. 

85
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,290
Those at the top, the ones with vested interest.

86
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,480
 They're abandoning you. 

87
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,240
 It's because they're replacing all of you with 

88
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,270
 cheap, obedient, low-quality foreigners! 

89
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,270
 Do you understand? Understand? Understand? 

90
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,540
 We understand. 

91
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,060
 I've talked about Master Seo Jeong Hak many times.  

92
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,140
 19000 won, 19000 won. 
 The Crisis of The Korean People 

93
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,280
 Make sure to read it. The pure ethnicity of the Korean people will disappear 

94
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,060
 from the earth and ours will become a country with no roots or genealogy, 

95
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,390
 swarming with all kinds of mongrels. 

96
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,070
 You have to wake up! 

97
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:07,430
 You have to get up with a bamboo spear and protect your country. 

98
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,750
 Patriotic Boys or Patriotic Youth Corps, we'll make something like this,  

99
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,580
 all over the country, and we'll build an army– 

100
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,540
 Honey, that's enough, that's enough. 

101
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,510
 Dear viewers, you always have to listen to pretty girls. Got it? 

102
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,610
 Look at you laughing because you know my wife is pretty. 

103
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,190
 So obsessed with women, you loser. 

104
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,350
 Show him to the camera. This loser's mugshot. 

105
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,940
Stop.

106
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,290
He was a part of the video editing staff.

107
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,780
It seems he was the president of Heo Jung Se's fan club, then was selected as a staff member.

108
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,790
He even worked as an election campaigner during the presidential election.

109
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,250
Interesting. He's going to organize a patriotic youth corp nationwide.

110
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,550
That guy Heo Jung Se had a crazy dream since early on.

111
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,370
Should we put him in court? This guy?

112
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,240
Of course, I agree. If we leave it like this, we don't know what else he'll do.

113
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,760
They act as if they're some kind of militia.

114
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,810
Cheers.

115
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm very amused by you making Kang Yo Han a campaign model.

116
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,860
To prevent him from screwing around our business,  our Director Jeong – I mean, I should call you Chairwoman Jeong now ...

117
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,110
Don't worry. I will keep a tight hold on him.

118
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,800
We've wasted so much time because that hotshot model got into our Dream Village business.

119
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,960
That's all money wasted.

120
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,070
So now, let's not be self-conscious and just push forward, all right?

121
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,590
We'll gather up all the poor and the ones protesting in Seoul, put them in the camp,

122
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,570
and make it a real entertainment show.

123
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,150
The title will be "Clean Korea."

124
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,880
We need to get rid of all the illegal immigrants.

125
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,540
That's the best way to boost your approval rating.

126
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,010
Just wait a little longer.  I can't do anything

127
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,380
just by trusting the police and prosecutors, who only think of stabbing me in the back.

128
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,630
I'll build a much more loyal organization and make sure it gets done.

129
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,390
We're almost ready now.

130
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,960
 Ministry of Justice Unit 2
 Juvenile Education Center TF 

131
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,130
 HMBN Chairman Park Du Man 

132
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,980
 Recording Log Report 

133
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,210
How far did you get on verifying the contents of Jeong Seon Ah's file?

134
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,150
It's not easy because it's from a long time ago, Minister.

135
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,620
Stop everything else and put all the teams together on this.

136
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,550
What are you doing? Work faster.

137
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,990
Yes, Minister. But there is one thing the team leader is worried about.

138
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,230
What is it?

139
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,960
Recently, there has been a growing number of random unprovoked attacks.

140
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,630
The main targets are foreign workers and women.

141
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,620
So what?

142
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,700
Well, there's a lot of public criticism, asking what the Ministry of Justice is doing about it.

143
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,790
Did people die at least?

144
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,140
No. But because they happen in the middle of the street in broad daylight.

145
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,020
It is causing a head-on collision with the "Safe Korea" slogan.

146
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,450
That's Heo Jung Se's slogan. Heo Jung Se's presidential campaign pledge.

147
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,630
Why would I care about that?

148
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,910
I'm sorry, Minister.

149
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,530
Heo Jung Se ... That man seems to think he will gain power from instigating overgrown kids

150
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:27,610
to create fear. He's delusional.

151
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,510
If we leave it alone, there will definitely be some who will go overboard.

152
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,100
When someone dies and the anger of the people is at its peak,

153
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,500
then that's when we'll go out to fight it.

154
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,790
I, Minister of Justice Cha Gyeong Hui,

155
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,600
as the next presidential candidate,

156
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,500
will aim for a unified Republic of Korea and embrace it.

157
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,460
That's right, Minister.

158
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,800
Focus on Jeong Seon Ah.

159
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,430
We have to step on it before it gets any bigger.

160
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,650
Seo Jeong Hak's sudden death is strange.

161
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:14,010
There must be a bigger picture here. One that bitch Jeong Seon Ah drew.

162
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,770
Yes, I understand.

163
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,630
- And, by the way ... 
 - Yes?

164
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,790
Are you frequently checking in on that guy?

165
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,870
Whom are you talking about?

166
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,760
Do Yeong Chun.

167
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,120
Ah, yes, I'm checking on him regularly.

168
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,570
I'm sure he has money hidden somewhere.

169
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,460
That sly bastard. He'd do anything for money.

170
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,370
What are you doing? Get out of here.

171
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,510
Ah, yes. Sorry.

172
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,310
To discuss a recent hot topic, I am here with Judge Oh Jin Ju of the live court show.

173
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,980
- Hello, Judge. 
 - Hello.

174
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,320
- Your recent photoshoot was truly amazing. 
 - Thank you.

175
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,550
Everybody is crazy about you. You should quit being a judge and become a movie star.

176
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,450
Not anyone can be an actor.

177
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,530
Everyone, I am meant to be a public official.

178
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,890
Retirement is a long way away.

179
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,980
Your Honor has great sense of humor.

180
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,320
Don't you feel a little overwhelmed, Judge?

181
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,990
You work under the eyes of the entire country.

182
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,120
You must be exhausted.

183
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,620
No. How could I be when so many people are rooting for me?

184
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,260
- Oh, is that so? 
 - Yes.

185
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,690
There are many people who send letters here to the judge's office.

186
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,910
- Shall I show you? 
 - Yes.

187
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,140
Did you collect them all by yourself?

188
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:54,410
It gives me strength and joy to have people who support and believe in me.

189
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,390
I can feel the sincerity of Judge Oh Jin Ju's feelings

190
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,770
You're the best!

191
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,830
It's over.

192
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,760
You were really amazing, Judge Oh.

193
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
I'm actually kind of cool, you know.

194
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,390
You should have done the interview too. It was a little awkward by myself.

195
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,240
I'm camera-shy.

196
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,770
Is that going to work? In this age of media, we need to communicate more with the citizens.

197
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,830
We need to be doing our next trial at a time like this.

198
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,900
I don't know what our chief is doing.

199
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,180
I have something to show you.

200
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,660
What is it?

201
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,960
-  Watch out. 
 - Don't move! 

202
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,680
 - Get him too! 

203
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,360
Oh my! These guys are crazy! Oh my! How could they?

204
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240
What are the cops doing not arresting these guys?

205
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,140
 Hey! That's cool. Awesome. 

206
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,060
Wait a minute.

207
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,890
 We are the power. 
 Bamboo Spear 

208
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,960
Should we

209
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,880
bring him to court? 
 - To the live court?

210
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,000
Judge Oh agreed.

211
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,060
But the problem is—

212
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,460
How do we get him to court when the cops are protecting him? That problem, right?

213
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,800
Yes. Charges must be filed for the trial to take place.

214
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,160
I don't know if it's possible to get him, with the President watching his back.

215
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,550
Why not? There is a way. The best person to help out with this.

216
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,720
Who are you talking about?

217
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,080
Well... Who would hate things more than anyone going the way Heo Jung Se wants?

218
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,700
Cha Gyeong Hui?

219
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,790
But will Cha Gyeong Hui help you with your plans?

220
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,830
Of course she won't listen to me.

221
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,900
That's why Lawyer Go In Guk leaked it to Cha Gyeong Hui through his connection with the prosecution.

222
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,390
Heo Jung Se's private organization is the Bamboo Spears.

223
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,090
If they catch him, we'll be able to prosecute him.

224
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,530
But they would find it burdensome to arrest him themselves.

225
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,090
But there is one cop who can catch him.

226
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,640
A cop?

227
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,020
Do you mean Su Hyeon?

228
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,280
The commissioner is protecting that yard, so she'll have to go into that yard alone without any backup.

229
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,190
It can't be Su Hyeon.

230
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,800
Isn't she already on the move?

231
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,270
 All right, okay. Now that Busan is done, after Busan 

232
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,540
 then we'll go to Daegu. Then where? 

233
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,550
 Then Daejeon. 

234
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,930
 Where are all my Daejeon people? You'll show us what you got, right? 

235
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,940
 You don't want to lose to those guys. 

236
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,500
 - Show them how cool and patriotic you are, okay?  
- What are you thinking about so seriously?

237
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,960
You startled me. When did you manage to sneak up silently on me?

238
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,770
You want to catch him?

239
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,680
Well...

240
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,480
Fine, you're right.

241
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,510
Since he was caught last time, he's been hiding and live-streaming alone like this.

242
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,630
Then you'll need to track him down. Should I help?

243
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,980
You will?

244
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,340
Give it here.

245
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,120
Really?

246
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,220
Here you go.

247
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,610
Let's see...

248
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,930
Alright, I doubt it's going to be this easy, but first...

249
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,000
 Incorrect IP Address 

250
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,250
I knew it. They've got tight security.

251
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,530
Computer majors are truly on another level.

252
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,900
 Gangster 

253
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,180
One second.

254
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,880
- Yeah, Su Hyeon.
 - Yeah, Ga On.

255
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,880
- You're not coming home tonight? 
 - Oh, I've been busy.

256
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,520
Beyond that, are you all right?

257
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,090
 That Bamboo Spear bastard edited the video of you pointing a gun at him as it suited him and uploaded it. 

258
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,250
Don't even mention it. I had to turn in my gun because of that.

259
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,400
 That jerk needs to be caught already. 

260
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,850
 But the higher-ups won't help and I can't get help from the cyber bureau either. 

261
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,340
If even I don't take action, we really don't know how far he will go.

262
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,640
You're already working on it?

263
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,020
Oh, I'm playing a game now.

264
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,160
- A game? 
 - Yeah.

265
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,580
You probably think all hacking is done by pounding on the keyboard, don't you?

266
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,070
Gosh, all you ordinary people.

267
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,810
A program is working hard in the background, so just wait.

268
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:20,510
It'll probably take a while. Maybe a day, or even a week.

269
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,970
Thank you, Elijah.

270
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,700
What's the matter?

271
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,900
He just clicked on the link I left in the comments section.

272
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,000
I didn't expect he would fall for such a simple trap.

273
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,610
What was it?

274
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,690
Girl group pictures.

275
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,580
Girl group?

276
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,660
 Yeah, Ga On. 

277
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,740
What? You found Bamboo Spear's location?

278
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,940
Where is he? I'll go right now.

279
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,100
Calm down first, Su Hyeon.

280
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,740
It's too dangerous to go alone, so let's request an official investigation first.

281
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,050
 I told you no one will help anyway. 

282
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,690
 Plus, catching a coward like him is no big deal. 

283
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,500
You don't even have a gun. It's too dangerous to go alone.

284
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,700
Stop worrying, Kim Ga On, and just give me the address.

285
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,710
I'm serious. Send me the address now.

286
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,540
Su Hyeon ... Su ...

287
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,030
 Presumed to have murdered Seo Jeong Hak 

288
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,910
The story's here, but

289
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,230
the evidence is lacking.

290
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,860
To drag her down in one shot, I need at least more circumstantial evidence.

291
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,480
- Minister Cha. 
- What is it?

292
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,360
- The foundation has cut down on funding for the ministry. 
- What did you just say?

293
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,970
Since they decided it unilaterally all of a sudden,

294
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,460
we won't have enough funds to run the unofficial organizations.

295
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,160
This wench is really...

296
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,580
 Minister Cha, you can't do this without an appointment! 

297
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,550
I'm sorry, she insisted on entering.

298
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,580
Damn it.

299
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,910
It's all right. I slept well.

300
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,220
Don't be like that, remember she works for our country.

301
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,090
Long time no see.

302
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,290
Has it been?

303
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,850
I've been a bit distant, haven't I?

304
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,890
Please forgive me.

305
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,480
Being the board chairwoman hasn't been easy.

306
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,430
Why did you cut back on funding for the ministry?

307
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,780
So you've come because of that?

308
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,680
You must've been very upset. Please try to understand.

309
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,670
There are many organizations to help,

310
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,080
and people are getting stingier with their money, so we're getting fewer donations.

311
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,920
But you're increasing funds given to the Blue House?

312
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,200
Well...

313
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,900
That was decided by the working-level employees,

314
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,870
so I don't remember it well.

315
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,230
Shall I refresh your memory?

316
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,880
Do you smell something?

317
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,410
Like what?

318
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,940
For some reason, there's a stink of blood surrounding you.

319
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,690
I wonder why that is.

320
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,850
What are you talking about?

321
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,930
How long has it been since Chairman Seo's death?

322
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,540
Right.

323
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,500
I must have hit a sore spot. I apologize if I did.

324
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,450
You served him for a long time.  It must be painful and heartbreaking.

325
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,600
What exactly is it you're trying to say, Minister Cha?

326
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,470
Being in the position that I'm in,

327
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,700
I tend to hear a lot of things going around.

328
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,990
Such as?

329
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,410
Like how a nationally respected elder committed suicide

330
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,560
and it wouldn't have been enough to have a national funeral for him,

331
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,680
yet you rushed to cremate his body.

332
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,220
Why was his suicide note written not by hand but typed on a computer?

333
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,020
Especially for an elder so proficient in calligraphy?

334
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,040
Are you bored these days?

335
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,560
- Should I give you more work to do? 
 - What?

336
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,000
Why don't you come back when you have more concrete evidence, then we'll talk.

337
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,810
I'm a bit busy... working for the country.

338
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,730
- Jae Hui? 
- Yes?

339
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,000
The guest is leaving.

340
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,550
Oh, and Minister Cha ...

341
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:14,450
I'm sorry but the cost of fuel for your car is too high.

342
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,780
The national finances aren't doing so well,

343
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,170
so why don't we change it to something smaller?

344
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,300
The citizens will be touched.

345
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:28,370
They'll say, 'of course, the great elder leading the country is different from others'.

346
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,200
You must be insane.

347
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,850
What on earth have you been doing?

348
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,540
Why is it taking so long to find something on Jeong Seon Ah?

349
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,910
I apologize, Minister. Please give us more time.

350
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,390
You incompetent bastards.

351
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,020
I need to meet Kang Yo Han.

352
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,340
Pardon? Y-You want to meet Kang Yo Han?

353
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,980
What are you so shocked for?

354
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,400
It was just so sudden.

355
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,430
Jeong Seon Ah's file mentioned that she worked as a maid in Kang Yo Han's house.

356
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,940
Kang Yo Han will definitely know something to help us dig into her past.

357
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,430
Set up an meeting with him quickly. Choose a quiet Japanese restaurant or something like that.

358
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,860
Yes, I understand.

359
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,210
Are you sure it's here?

360
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,300
How did you find him anyway?

By the way, why are you here?

362
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,680
I just thought you'd be bored by yourself.

363
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,770
You were that worried about me coming here alone?

364
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,610
- Yes, I was worried. 
 - What?

365
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,020
Not for you. I was worried you'd end up beating Mr. Bamboo Spear half to death.

366
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,430
It's an electrically powered shutter.

367
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,670
I think it's the only entrance for this building.

368
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,630
- Hey, Elijah. 
 - It's Elijah?

369
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,300
The entrance is closed by a shutter.

370
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,550
Oh, okay.

371
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:31,250
- Why did she call? 
 - Elijah's the one who traced the IP address to this building.

372
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,550
Really?

373

She's a computer genius who received an early admission to Stanford for Computer Science.

374
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,890
Impressive.

375
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,850
I still think this will be hard to open. Let's look for another entrance.

Let's talk here. You're all on the same team.

451

How did you know about this place?

452
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,310
I'm quite interested in the education of the young.

Forget it, I'll just get to the point.

What's your relationship with Jeong Seon Ah?

455
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,210
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

456
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,140
I heard Jeong Seon Ah used to work as a maid in your house, is it true?

457
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,110
I'm not sure. I can't speak about someone else's private life.

458
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,920
There are even rumors that she killed her own parents.

Is that so? That's shocking.

460

You sound as if you're saying 'nothing's for free'.

461
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,720
What is it you want?

462
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,470
The Bamboo Spear guy.

463
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,920
Bamboo Spear?

464
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,490
Cooperate with me so I can put him on trial.

465
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:16,260
The prosecution just has to indict him, then you can sit and enjoy the show.

466
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,440
Heo Jung Se will make noise about this.

467
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,360
Why are you being so timid?

468
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,490
I'm the one who will have to deal with the consequences anyway.

469
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,670
I understand.

470
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,430
Thank you.

471
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,550

00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,040
I found this on the way.

473
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,030
Should I give it to you? Or maybe him?

474
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,680
 Accidental Death Case Report 

475
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,890
 Legal Declaration 

476
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,030
 Name: Jeong Seon Ah 

477
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,920
 Autopsy Report 

478
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,250
An internet broadcaster...

479
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,850
Isn't this too boring for the Live Court?

480
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,530
He incites violence and causes disorder in the society.

481
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,090
Wouldn't the Blue House be happy about it as well?

482
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:36,730
I think it aligns well with the law and order reinforcement policy the president is pushing.

483
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,400
That could be.

484
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,820
All right.  Give it your best shot.

485
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,000
- How did it go? 
 - Passed.

486
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,550
Then, this time I will set up the plan.

487
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,860
You will?

488
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,420
I know punks like Bamboo Spear the best.

489
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,420
This is a clear challenge against the beloved and respected great citizens of the nation.

490
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,460
How dare they make a patriotic young man,

491
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,860
who bravely tried to protect the country, stand trial?

492
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,280
Are judges that great?  Are judges above the people?

493
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,810
This is clearly a judicial coup d'état.  Coup d'état.

494
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,300
This isn't it, though.

495
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,920
Didn't all this stem from his pure patriotism that made him try to protect the country?

496
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,890
Right?  We should make sure this trial proceeds in a fair manner,

497
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:48,010
 so I will closely watch it until the end.
     

498
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,910
I will rip apart Kang Yo Han, damn.

499
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,890
I am going crazy.

500
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:04,810
Mr. Attorney, I am a political offender.  A revolutionary leader.

501
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,130
I am on a different level from petty criminals.  Do you understand?

502
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:14,020
Then, should I not submit materials for mitigating factors?  Such as unfortunate childhood.

503
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,980
Just a minute...

504
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:21,160
But wouldn't it be more advantageous to submit them?

505
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,960
Go ahead and submit them.  Highlighting the details as much as possible.

506
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,860
Sure, I will do that.

507
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,250
Since we are talking about it,

508
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:36,790
Kang Yo Han and the young judge even threatened me wielding a wooden beam.

509
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,780
How about we let the media know this?

510
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,660
If you are going to claim insanity, you need a doctor's diagnosis.

511
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,450
I am telling you that I saw it.

512
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,420
Do you think I am lying to you, then?

513
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,350
Ah, is that right?

514
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:57,480
Then can you give me a list of people who witnessed the incident at the scene?

515
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,000
I need objective evidence.

516
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,160
Ah, never mind.  I was there alone.

517
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,270
But you're really confident, right?

518
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,240
It would be terrible if I were sentenced to prison.

519
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,650
Yes, please don't worry.

520
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,120
I will make sure you get released on probation.

521
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,220
Such devotion.  Taking care of the plants at home,

522
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,410
taking care of a prickly girl and strange ajeossi at a strange house.

523
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,760
I am sure that I am not any less strange myself.

524
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,140
That's right.  You are a bit strange.

525
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,490
Why?  Did the professor say something?

526
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,610
What about the professor?  I haven't seen him since I last met him here.

527
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,680
Ah, is that right?  I was just wondering if he was nagging at you about me.

528
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,700
You suddenly came to see me at the police agency and asked me how I would feel if you were to do something bad.

529
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,110
Kang Yo Han appeared when I was apprehending Bamboo Spear.

530
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,090
Are you, by chance, going around doing something weird?

531
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,700
Does it seem that way?

532
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,130
No, just... I am jealous.  Jealous.

533
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,510
It's strange to see my close friend suddenly hanging around the ultra-rich.

534
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,980
It feels like you are going to a different world.

535
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,950
I see.

536
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:33,230
He's not rich.  When you get to know him, Kang Yo Han is very poor.

537
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,090
I am much richer.

538
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,020
I have good memories with my mom and dad.

539
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,440
I have this pretty house that I cared for, and...

540
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,090
I even have my own fan club.  OpposeDaOn.
   Milky complexion 

541
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,070
I am leaving.

542
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,820
You are leaving already?

543
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,050
I am busy.  Do you think the police can be idle?

544
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,480
Get home safely.

545
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,180
I have you,

546
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,450
Su Hyeon.

547
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,140
Hi, Young Master.

548
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,200
 Chief Judge Kang Yo Han 

549
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:19,010
Although you are the leader of the support team, don't you think it's rude to barge in like this?

550
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,520
So why do you make me keep barging in?

551
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,210
Could it possibly be that you are doing it on purpose because you want to see me?

552
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,680
What is this about?

553
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,250
The live court.  Why did you have to pick a troublesome case again?

554
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,080
He's neither a politician, nor a chaebol, so why would it be troublesome?

555
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,400
Isn't he just a petty criminal?

556
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,140
He's one of Heo Jung Se's people.

557
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,560
He went berserk, saying he would get rid the live court.  I barely managed to calm him down.

558
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,570
I told you to be patient for just two years.

559
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,660
Why do you keep causing trouble?

560
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,520
Wow, that lunatic is one of president's people?

561
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,080
Interesting.

562
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,690
But that punk attacked my niece.

563
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,510
He did?

564
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,520
Even so, you can't.

565
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,980
You should give in this time.  Give him a good scolding and let him go.

566
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,360
What if I tell you I can't do that?

567
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,780
Then it will put me in a difficult position.

568
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:28,080
If I am put in a difficult position, you will also be put in a difficult position.

569
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,740
All right.  I will think about it.

570
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:37,440
Young Master, you are so good these days, listening to me.

571
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,850
So don't barge in anymore, all right?

572
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,730
So don't make me barge in.

573
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,540
Young Master, you should invite me.

574
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:57,530
Is your house still pretty?

575
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,960
Same as before?

576
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,320
Are you missing the house you stayed in as a maid?

577
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:24,740
Never, never again say something like that.

578
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,570
I was just a guest who stayed in that house for a little while.

579
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,800
Don't dare insult me.

580
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,890
Fine.  I will keep that in mind.

581
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,130
- We are! 
 - Bamboo Spear!

582
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,500
- We are! 
 - Bamboo Spear!

583
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,270
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

584
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,030
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

585
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:14,810
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

586
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,640
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

587
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,910
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

588
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,160
Bamboo Spear! Bamboo Spear!

589
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,080
As you can see, the Supreme Court here

590
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,320
is hotter than anything because of the heat of today's trial.

591
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,290
Citizens supporting the defendant

592
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,410
 continue to protest within the Supreme Court. 

593
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,360
 The Supreme Court decided that today's trial  

594
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,790
will be held behind closed doors, for fear that the high tension here

595
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,260
would cause safety accidents.

596
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,780
 Live Court Show 

597
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,380
We will begin the trial.

598
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,560
Defendant Kim Chung Sik?

599
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,970
I'm Kim Ju Won. Please call me Kim Ju Won. 
  Defendant's Seat 

600
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,620
The trial has to be held using the name on your resident registration card.

601
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,790
Defendant Kim Chung Sik.

602
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,040
Let me ask you one more time. Defendant Kim Chung Sik?

603
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,600
Yes.

604
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,110
You are in this court for

605
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:19,120
leading and inciting random mass assaults on foreign workers,

606
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,500
women and sexual minorities nationwide.

607
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,330
Your Honor.

608
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,740
- Do you have something to say? 
 - Yes.

609
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,300
Go ahead.

610
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,640
Before the trial begins, I would like to make a solemn declaration

611
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,570
before history and before the nation.

612
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,280
My patriotic deed

613
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,490
is not something that can be judged in a mere secular court.

614
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,620
Therefore, I would like to read a declaration of salvation.

615
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,100
The court is not the place to instigate, Defendant.

616
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,140
The Japanese judge would have said the same thing when he tried the independence fighters.

617
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,860
What the hell are you afraid of to be blocking the truth, Judge Kang Yo Han?

618
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,070
All right. Fine.

619
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,160
Please, read it.

620
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,120
One man of faith

621
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,920
is equal to the power of a million men who pursue only profit.

622
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,670
I, Kim Ju Won,

623
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,240
am willing to be the devil for the sake of my beloved country.

624
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,200
Citizens, don't be hypocritical and take care of the people of our country first.

625
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,370
Three years of plague, jobs are all gone, 
  Prosecution Facts: Suspect Kim Chung Sik assaulted 9 people in front of the Sam K Building 

626
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:39,600
and foreigners enter the land, swarming with crime. 
    

627
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,360
Our women walk around the streets giggling

628
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,510
and linking arms with those foreigners!

629
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,610
That's how the people of other countries are taking our young people's jobs,

630
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:51,890
taking our women, and even taking our soul!

631
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,570
Fixing these problems in our country

632
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,890
is the only way for us to become the true masters of the Republic of Korea again.

633
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,840
I love this country, so I'm sure of it.

634
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,910
Let's get the foreigners out of this land!

635
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,410
Let's kick out mongrel humans from Korea!

636
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,440
 A clean Korea! A safe Republic of Korea! 

637
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,180
 Let's rebuild it. 

638
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,470
 That's patriotism! 

639
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,070
We are the power.

640
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,820
 Power, that's right, Hyeong-nim! 
   

641
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,720
 Ladies and gentlemen, we support such a man.
   

642
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,410
 Hurry up and vote now! Now! 
   

643
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:32,650
 What's going on here? 55, 56, 57!  
    

644
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,450
Hey, what is this? Huh? What happened?

645
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,750
It seems his followers are moving in an organized manner.

646
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:46,220
 76% Innocent, 24% Guilty 

647
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,230
Have you finished reading?

648
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,280
Yes, well, I'll end it here for now.

649
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,930
Defendant.

650
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:53,960
Yes?

651
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,710
Do you know what kind of work

652
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:59,510
the group of foreign workers you assaulted are engaged in?

653
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,870
I'm not sure. Does a revolutionary even need to know that?

654
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,600
They lost two of their colleagues

655
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,420
in a toxic gas leak at the sewage repair site.

656
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,630
It was a repair work  that kept getting delayed because no one wanted to enter the site.

657
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,740
Defendant, who on earth did they take the jobs from?

658
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,210
In a war, there are bound to be innocent victims.

659
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:24,390
Don't diminish the justified anger of the citizens, Your Honor.

660
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,230
Citizens...

661
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,530
Did you just say justified anger?

662
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,590
 Ah! What are you doing? Why are you doing this?  

663
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,780
 Busan Man Bamboo Spears Unit is here! Cleaning Busan 

664
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,730
It seems incredibly justified.

665
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,110
Right? Doesn't it seem fair?

666
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:45,600
Isn't it because people from other countries are taking our women?

667
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,400
Judge, don't you know the purity of a homogeneous race?

668
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,500
Did you say, "our women"?

669
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,360
Women are also citizens of this country.

670
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,860
They are not some objects you left somewhere.

671
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,960
What's this nonsense blabber about pure race, seriously...

672
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,220
I'm sorry. I went a little too far in expressing myself in court.

673
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:10,140
I can't control myself because I'm so justifiably angry.

674
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,760
That sounded like cursing.

675
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,150
I couldn't hear you because you spoke softly. Come and talk to me.

676
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,840
- Defendant. 
 - Should I go there then?

677
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:25,410
Defendant. Please focus.

678
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,280
- Defendant. 
 - Yes.

679
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,900
Calm down.

680
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,670
Yes.

681
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,820
It's the first time seeing you today, but the more I see you, the worse I feel for you.

682
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,180
Because I wonder how hard life has been for you.

683
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,900
I know you, but you don't seem to remember me.

684
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,770
- Your Honor. 
 - Yes.

685
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,900
If you allow me, may I go down by the defendant's side

686
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,100
for a while and continue the conversation?

687
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,390
Yes, of course.

688
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,140
Thank you.

689
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,540
Here

690
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,000
is a young man.

691
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,700
He is pretending to be strong like this,

692
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,990
but inside he is a wounded child.

693
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,100
What are you doing now?

694
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,800
I'm talking about the materials that the lawyer submitted

695
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,430
for extenuating circumstances.

696
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,850
 Defense Attorney Seat 

697
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,530
The defendant has been obsessed with getting attention from others

698
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:44,470
since he was a kid, isn't that right?

699
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,250
- What did you say? 
 - Your grandmother said she was really worried.

700
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,040
Let's take a look.

701
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,330
 Our Chung Sik wasn't a bad kid. 
   

702
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:57,270
- Grandma. 
 -  People say he incited some kind of demonstration. 

703
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,090
-  There is no way he would do such a thing.  
 - What is that?

704
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:02,360
 It's just that he's immature, and he's unruly. 

705
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,450
Did you talk about that?

706
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,580
 Please forgive him. 

707
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,170
 By the way, Chung Sik! The money you took last time. 

708
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:12,520
- Turn it off. I said turn it off! 
 -  That's what your grandmother 

709
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,090
 - had saved up for the funeral.   
 - Please be quiet. 
    

710
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,310
 I don't care about anything else, 

711
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,620
 but I hope you'll give her back that money. Please! 

712
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,000
 You're crazy! Why did you say that? 

713
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,850
 That's how you're going to be able to have a funeral, isn't it? 

714
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,700
 Oh, my! You're out of your mind! You're crazy! 

715
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,840
- Defense Attorney, what were the defendant's school days like? 
 -  Why did you say that? 

716
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,020
Yes, well, his homeroom teacher

717
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,720
bravely decided to give a statement. Let's take a look together.

718
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,990
Wh-Wh-What did he —

719
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:44,700
 Did he instigate violence for political purposes? 
   

720
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,460
 That's absolutely impossible. 

721
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,150
 Even when he was in school, he pretended to be a bully,  

722
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:52,230
 but in reality, he was a student who admired a bully group and only followed them around 

723
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,590
 but was not treated as part of the group. 

724
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,550
 Wow! Wow, this is a waste of time, a waste of money. 

725
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,280
 You're a loser pretending to be a bully? 

726
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,790
 It's Chung Sik, right? We went to the same high school. 

727
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,760
 Do you know what he did when he was in school? 

728
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,640
 He got busted planting a hidden camera in the girls' bathroom, and he got expelled. 
   
   
   

729
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,620
 He is absolutely not the kind of person  

730
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,940
 who would start a revolution or something like that. 

731
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,960
 Please be lenient. 

732
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,350
You're going to make him a loser instead of the devil?

733
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,590
It's going to get all screwed up.

734
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,370
That's what the people who know the defendant say about him,

735
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:32,180
but there's only one thing that bothers me.

736
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,270
The defendant was constantly asking for donations through private broadcasting.

737
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,940
Saying he needs a revolutionary fund to save the country.

738
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,450
A lot of money has been collected.

739
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,130
What on earth did you do with that money?

740
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,410
Why are you avoiding my eyes, defendant?

741
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:54,010
Perhaps, did you buy a bomb or a gun on the black market?

742
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:57,080
What on earth is revolutionary funding?

743
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,830
No! I don't know anything about that.

744
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,890
I exercise the right to remain silent.

745
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,530
Defendant, if this is true,

746
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,630
this is high treason.

747
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,580
Do you know that a main perpetrator of high treason

748
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,360
is sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or life imprisonment in solitary confinement, Defendant?

749
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,650
No, it's not.

750
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,350
Defense Attorney, do you have something to say?

751
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,370
Yes, the defendant never gathered that money

752
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,590
for committing high treason.

753
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:26,190
This is the defendant's privacy, so I was a little reluctant to reveal it,

754
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,240
but with the situation right now, I can't help it. Shall we take a look together?

755
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,160
- Let's take a look. 
  - I'm working as a broadcasting jockey (a live streamer).  

756
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,000
 Kim Chung Sik and another of my fans were competing against each other 
    

757
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,790
 and sent so many donation balloons. 

758
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,620
 Millions of won every day. 

759
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,350
- That's not true! I do- don't know that person! 
  - He said he had financial difficulties so I told him to stop sending.  

760
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,220
- What are you doing? 
  -  He asked me to meet him. 

761
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,200
- Calm down, Defendant. 
  - 'Let's meet just once.' He kept begging me. 

762
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,380
 Oh, my gosh, I felt too pressured. 

763
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,060
 I really wish he stops doing that. 

764
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,050
By chance, did you give your grandma's funeral savings to that person...?

765
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:03,080
You went too far.

766
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,580
Wait a moment. It's all right. It's all right.

767
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:14,190
It's all right. I told you I'd get you on a suspended sentence.

768
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,300
Let's go in. It's all right.

769
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,100
It's all right.

770
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,600
Your Honor and the two judges.

771
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,090
The defendant, as you can see, is not some kind of revolutionary,

772
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,220
nor is he a dangerous person instigating civil war.

773
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:36,690
To be honest, the matter is not even worth to be brought to justice.

774
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:40,570
- Defense Attorney. 
 - Although the defendant's fault is by no means small,

775
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:45,230
I would appreciate it if you could give him a chance to reform himself.

776
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,210
I have thought about

777
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,660
what would be the most appropriate punishment for the defendant,

778
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,170
whether it's flogging or jail time,

779
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,330
but the defendant is still young,

780
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,840
and some say we should give the defendant a chance,

781
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,540
so it was decided that the defendant

782
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,470
would be sentenced to three years in prison,

783
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:22,820
with a five year suspended sentence.

 3 years in prison 

784
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,440
However, considering that the defendant's crime is bad

785
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,320
and the risk of recidivism is very high,

786
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,010
I order the defendant to wear an electronic anklet

787
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:37,490
and be placed on probation.

788
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,760
The location of the defendant will be displayed in the DIKE app

789
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,300
in real time, via the electronic anklet signal.

790
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,650
 DIKE 
 Kim Chung Sik 
 Defendant location information. 

791
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,490
 Electronic Anklets! Seriously. 

792
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,220
 You should know how humiliating it is.  

793
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,420
 What do you do when it's hot in summer? Can't even wear shorts? Huh? 

794
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,750
 Starting today, I'm recruiting a squad to go catch Bamboo Spear. 
   
   
   
   
    

795
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,350
 Hey Bamboo Spear! Come out of that room, huh? 

796
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,650
 I'll follow you to the end. 

797
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,940
Fellow citizens who are watching this trial,

798
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,320
I ask you to become

799
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,310
probation officers for the defendant.

800
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,680
Don't take your eyes off, even for a second,

801
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,850
of what the defendant is doing or where he is.

802
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,350
The defendant needs your attention.

803
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,130
Isn't that right, Defendant?

804
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,430
I brought him up so carefully, dammit.

805
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,700
It's all screwed.

806
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:38,190
F**k, seriously! Kang Yo Han, Kang Yo Han, Kang Yo Han!

807
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,220
 Give him a good scolding in court and let him go. 

808
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,980
 All right. 

809
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,140
 I will think about it. 

810
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,850
Dammit.

811
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,330
Were you playing with me?

812
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,900
You can see Bamboo Spear over there, right? I will give Bamboo Spear a rod of love*! 
 (*corporal punishment)

813
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,610
I'll show it to you live until the end.

The Kim Chung Sik incident was such a disgrace to the country and should never happen again.

816
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:59,280
It's a complete disgrace to the voluntary movement that's taking place across the country

817
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:05,460
and the pure patriotism of our beloved and respected citizens.

818
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,010
It is an incident that smells disgusting.

819
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:12,840
Yes, something smells. I can seriously smell the conspiracy.

820
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,900
Where did he go?

821
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,170
- Hey, for now, let's go. 
 - Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly...

822
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,890
But that man, Kim Chung Sik, is he really a Korean? The same kind of Korean as us?

823
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:34,000
A real Korean like us. Not a fake Korean, but a real Korean citizen.

824
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,210
The descendants of the Korean pure-blooded Dangun* wouldn't do anything so fu—  
  (Mythical founder of the first kingdom of Korea) 

825
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:45,700
I'm sorry.  They would never do anything so terribly embarrassing.

826
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,500
That is all.

827
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:05,030
Hide well, I might see your hair.* 
  (*Hide and seek game catchphrase, like 'ready or not, here I come.') 

828
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,950
- Are you going to leave Chung Sik like that? 
 - Hey, are you crazy?

829
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,630
Don't ever say his name again until you die.

830
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:21,160
Yeon Jeong, I'm so tired. Ah, this Judge Kang!

831
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,650
Hey! Why do you keep running away?

832
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,500
Your location comes all out over here.

833
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,730
Everyone, we will now punish Bamboo Spear.

834
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,990
Hey, Bamboo Spear, get ready.

835
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,330
Hey, is this fun for you guys?

836
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,920
Is it not fun?

837
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,670
Beat him up with the rod of love!

838
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,500
    Let's go get Bamboo Spear~~~ Bamboo Spear is dying today. Ha Ha Ha / Welcome Donations!

- Butler, can you turn it off now? 
   - Yes, Master. 

841
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,940
Why, are you uncomfortable?

842
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,110
I feel I've created another monster.

843
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,920
A monster is not created.

844
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,960
A monster that was already there opens its eyes on its own volition.

845
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,510
Whenever a good excuse comes up.

846
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,370
You're working hard.

847
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,290
Minister, what are you doing here?

848
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,080
Why are you so surprised?

849
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,160
It's unlike you, Director Jeong.

850
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:23,480
Did you come to do a search and seizure?

851
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,160
You are a funny woman.

852
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,610
Were you such a great woman?

853
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:36,420
To the point where this country's Minister of Justice would come to personally do a search and seizure?

854
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:41,780
Then do you have something to ask me?

855
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,600
Oh, you seem to be confused.

856
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,990
I'm here to remind you of your position.

857
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,170
- My position? 
 - You know.

858
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,040
It suits you better

859
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:01,660
that you stand quietly with your hands together, behind someone.

860
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,970
If someone doesn't understand their own story,

861
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,230
it won't end well.

862
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:16,890
Minister Cha ... Aren't you the one who is not aware of her position?

863
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,300
Are you still under the delusion that you're the number one presidential candidate?

864
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,370
Even after your son became like that?

865
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:27,010
Aren't you too confident?

866
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:31,680
Do you think you've completely erased your past?

867
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,500
What do you mean my past?

868
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,850
What the hell are you trying to say?

869
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:44,350
Why do people around you keep dying?

870
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,120
When you were twelve, it was your mom.

871
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,500
When you were twenty, it was your father, who left home abandoning you and your mother.

872
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,600
And recently,

873
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,750
Master Seo, whom you were serving as a secretary.

874
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:05,070
Ah, I didn't know you were into fiction.

875
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:08,100
You're very imaginative.

876
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,770
Do work that suits you.

877
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,260
I heard you were a maid?

878
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,020
Jeez, what a beggar-like...

879
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,720
I'll see you again.

880
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:40,990


881
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,160
 Yes, Eonni? 

882
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,130
Kang Yo Han leaked information about me to Cha Gyeong Hui.

883
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:55,010
 - What did you say?  
 - Find out.

884
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:59,240
 - Don't tell me Kang Yo Han—  
 - Shut up and find out right now!

885
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:04,530
 If you interfere with my work, you will pay the price. 

886
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:07,310
 It seems you've been working pretty hard to get where you are. 

887
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,210
 Will it be all right with you? 

888
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,620
I'm going to kill him.

889
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:41,180
Kang Yo Han, I'm going to rip you apart.

890
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:47,560

897
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:22,710
 Hi, Young Master. 

898
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,140
 I think it would be fun to play with you. 

899
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,900
 Do you think she will hold your hand? 

900
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,890
 I'll give you a week. 

901
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,490
 Bring me what I want. 

902
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,560
 Maybe she'll be on Cha Gyeong Hui's side. 

903
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:37,160
 First step. They're going to state that Kang  made them give false testimony. 

904
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,270
 Isn't it too dangerous? You said she was an unpredictable person. 

905
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:43,930
 It's life or death even if you risk everything you have. 

906
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:49,190
 Are you scared of me? That's a shame.
