 This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea.  All characters, organizations, events, etc. are fictional.

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,420
You're still pretty.

10
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,100
Don't tell me it's you.

11
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,250
Hello, Young Master.

12
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,070
♫   I can't breathe, I can't breathe  ♫

13
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:24,550
♫  I cannot stop it anymore, it swallows me whole  ♫

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,310
♫   Save me from myself   ♫

  Episode 6  

16
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,520
Ga On, wake up.

17
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,160
Ga On, come on, wake up.

18
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,990
Ga On, I said wake up.

19
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,640
Elijah, what brings you here at this time?

20
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,320
- Yo Han is gone. 
 - Huh?

21
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,430
You heard me, Yo Han is gone! I woke up but he wasn't there.

22
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,760
Where did he go?

23
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,190
Were you scared because Yo Han wasn't here?

24
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,860
- Who said I was scared? 
 - Is he meeting his lover?

25
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,810
Yo Han has never left this house

26
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,250
ever since that accident.

27
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,980
It's hot. Be careful.

28
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,970
What is this? What kind of house has such a bad heating system?

29
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,380
It's just uselessly huge.

30
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,020
Isn't it true that you actually like Yo Han too?

31
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,510
- What? 
 - If you think about it..

32
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:56,160
You helped find the prison in America and I think you did it because you thought it was meaningful.

33
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,980
- It's fun. 
 - Fun?

34
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,080
Maybe it would've been more fun they cut it off.

35
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,100
No wonder you're all family.

36
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Don't say that.

37
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,660
Yo Han destroys everything near him.

38
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,270
I hate people like that.

39
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,910
What do you mean?

40
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,990
You didn't hear from the ajumma?

41
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,560
They said Yo Han was like that ever since he was young.

42
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,440
He made the housemaid who liked him jump from the second floor.

43
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,060
Even Dad...

44
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,920
and even me...

45
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,740
You still have that habit.

46
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,790
Not knowing your place and the habit of touching everything.

47
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,090
Oh, Young Master, you recognize me only now?

48
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,770
 My goodness, how are they so pretty? 

49
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,600
  I didn't even know a world like this existed. 

50
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,790
  A world full of only pretty things! 

51
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,860
  Don't make a fuss and focus on learning your job. 

52
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,030
  What do you have to do in order to live like this? 

53
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,590
  Do I have to be born again? 
 - Tsk tsk. 

54
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,780
  The chairman doesn't like talkative people. 

55
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,380
 If you don't want to be kicked out, close your mouth. 

56
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,990
  What about Master Yo Han? How could he be so pretty and handsome? 

57
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,190
  How could they put someone like that in the basement? 

58
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,960
  Stop! 

59
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,980
  Please eat, Young Master. I prepared it for you. 

60
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,040
  Thanks. 

61
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:16,390
  When the chairman isn't home, you should go outside. I'll be the lookout for you. 

62
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,940
  Do you like me? 

63
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,060
  Yes. 

64
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,350
  How much do you like me? 

65
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,330
  Huh? 

66
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,420
  I said, how much do you like me? 

67
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,130
  A lot. Very very much. 

68
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,000
  Really? 

69
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,420
  Then, can you jump from here? 

70
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,200
  What? 

71
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,160
  Can you do that for me?  

72
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,950
  Really? 

73
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,920
  Seon Ah! 

74
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,600
You were so mean.

75
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,900
I liked you so much.

76
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,060
Ridiculous. I'm sure what you liked was something else.

77
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,430
  If I were you, I wouldn't do that. 

78
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,110
 Young Master! 

79
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,390
  If you get caught, it won't end well. That person doesn't know forgiveness. 

80
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,710
  Are you worrying about me now? 

81
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,330
  You're worried about me, right? 

82
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,720
  I like you so much, Young Master. Don't you like me? 

83
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,620
  That's weird ... it seems that things have been going missing lately. 

84
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,520
  Really? 

85
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,350
  Truthfully, there has been something on my mind recently too... 

86
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,980
  What is it? 

87
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,780
  I am cautious in saying this but.. 

88
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,200
 Young Master Yo Han has been going outside often recently 

89
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,900
  Even though the Chairman told him to stay in the basement. 

90
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,560
  - Is that so? 
 - Yes, I'm worried. 

91
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,830
  Not that! 

92
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
  That's my older brother's memento left by his mother. He cherishes that! 

93
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,170
  If you touch that, I'll report everything I saw. 

94
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,940
  I was just looking at it because it was so pretty! 

95
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,420
  If I laid a hand on Madam's stuff, I would die in the Chairman's hands! 

96
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,950
  Do you like me? 

97
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,150
  Then, can you jump off from here? 

98
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,740
Oh? Did I?

99
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,140
You have such good memory, Young Master. You're really smart.

100
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,130
But still, I did like you.

101
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,490
I've always liked everything that sparkles, you see.

102
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,490
Whether then, or now.

103
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,660
Really? It seems that you worked hard all your life.

104
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,680
So are you playing the maid

105
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,300
while stealing things here and there at the foundation, now?

106
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,440
You are impressive, Young Master.

107
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,920
You eliminated your idiotic older brother and then played the hero,

108
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,830
coming out of there holding his daughter in your arms so you wouldn't be suspected.

109
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,000
I can't help but to fall for you.

110
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,950
What makes you think Yo Han did it? There must have been something that convinced you.

111
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,350
- His computer. 
 - His computer?

112
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,120
When I was twelve, I unlocked Yo Han's computer for fun.

113
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,710
There was a hidden folder, so I looked through it.

114
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,790
And it was in there.

115
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,820
The form to cancel the donation pledge.

116
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,270
Also, the date it was created was

117
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,180
a week before the fire erupted.

118
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,710
To me, Yo Han was all I had.

119
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,220
To me...

120
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,700
Stop talking about past events and get to the point.

121
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,430
Shall I?

122
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,260
I don't care whether you play trial in court or steam and eat Cha Gyeong Hui.

123
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,320
But I'd like it if you laid off your interest on our foundation.

124
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,150
Young Master, you're trying to interfere now with the ranches of sheep that have been carefully nurtured by others.

125
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:16,000
That Dream Village or whatever you're doing must be a very sparkling project.

126
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,390
You know you and I are in the same type.

127
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,790
If we don't invade each other's territory, a lot of interesting things could hap—

128
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,890
If I were you, I wouldn't do this. It's a waste of time.

129
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,780
Right now, it would be better if you killed me, when you have the chance.

130
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,600
That's faster.

131
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,100
Because never again ... will you be able to capture me like this.

132
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,140
- If this is how you act— 
 - Your threats are meaningless.

133
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,740
For me, there is nothing... to protect.

134
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,600
Really?

135
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,310
Such a waste.

136
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,580
You stabbed him yourself, but what's with that reaction?

137
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,360
The thing I'm afraid of most in this world is needles.

138
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,290
Ah, sure, sure.

139
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,780
Jae Hui? Take our Young Master back to his house.

140
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,590
Huh? Why don't you finish him off, as he said himself?

141
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,900
No, a sheep dog needs a wolf.

142
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:53,530
The more disruptive Kang Yo Han is, the more the Foundation leaders have no choice but to rely on me.

143
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Still, this friend is too fearless.

144
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,760
Nothing to protect?

145
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,320
There is no such human being.

146
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,150
Chief, where did you go yesterday?

147
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,360
You're even interested in my personal life now?

148
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,790
I was with a tough woman, should I tell you about it?

149
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,140
She pulled my hair and kissed—

150
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,710
Ah, that's enough.

151
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,200
Ga On.

152
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,890
Yeah?

153
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,070
- Open that for me. 
 - Huh?

154
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,690
I said, open that for me.

155
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,630
Yes, yes.

156
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,920
- Here? 
 - Yeah.

157
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,770
You're going to eat ramen this early in the morning?

158
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,160
Pour water and bring it to me.

159
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,970
Elijah.

160
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,900
What about my ramen?

161
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,130
Let's eat rice, not ramen.

162
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,550
Rice?

163
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,210
Chief, come and eat.

164
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,100
Why suddenly rice?

165
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,690
I'm tired of this family. Let's eat rice like normal human beings.

166
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,320
I'm living off this house so I made some food. So hurry and come..

167
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,730
Chief, you hurry and come too.

168
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,390
What? Who said I wanted him to make food? Such a busybody.

169
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,360
The corner of your mouth is smiling.

170
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,250
What are you saying?

171
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,290
What is that unpleasant expression?

172
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,860
I'm just amazed.

173
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,730
Why are you amazed?

174
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,320
Why are you looking at Kim Ga On's butt with such yearning?

175
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,860
- When did I ever— 
 - Hurry and come!

176
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,520
- Ah, okay! 
 - Ah, okay!

177
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,990
I'm going to kill you!

178
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,030
Is this supposed to be "simple"?

179
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,070
 Should I order some more salmon, Master Ga On?  

180
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,990
Yes, and some celery too.

181
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,890
"Master Ga On"?

182
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,100
But this is Korean food.

183
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,120
You don't like Korean food?

184
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,640
I think I was a food-testing palace maid in my past life. 
   (palace maid who tested the king's food) 

185
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,130
I hate Korean food so much. I must have died from poison while food-testing.

186
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,270
All right, don't eat it if you don't want to.

187
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,750
I'll taste it to see how bad it is.

188
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,280
There will be no poison.

189
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,070
What are you doing? Eat.

190
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,940
I said this before, but I don't know taste.

191
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,410
I just chew and swallow.

192
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,300
You must really not have any taste.

193
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,070
But ... why are you doing this all of a sudden?

194
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,690
I told you. I should at least make some food since I'm living off you people.

195
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,690
I'm telling you beforehand, but I decline any sympathy.

196
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,280
I'm not in the position of such luxury.

197
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,470
Do you want fruit? Tell me if you need anything else.

198
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,870
All right.

199
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,940
Where did you learn how to cook?

200
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,530
- What do you mean "learn"? 
 - Then what?

201
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,090
Sixteen years as the son of restaurant owners and living alone for thirteen years.

202
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,730
If you're the son of restaurant owners, aren't you still the son of restaurant owners?

203
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,280
Did your parents stop running their restaurant?

204
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,920
It just ended up like that.

205
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,330
Have some kiwi.

206
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,220
W-what is this?

207
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,440
Young Master.

208
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,040
This unfamiliar harmony that doesn't fit with this house ... what is this?

209
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,620
Young Master.

210
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,640
You don't even lay a finger on the food that I make.

211
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,000
Ajumoni, I saved some for you too.

212
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,780
Elijah.

213
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,000
- You're not sleeping yet, right? 
 - I'm still digesting.

214
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,620
It didn't taste too bad, but I'm not the type who can eat too much.

215
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,500
Oh, really? That was a week's worth.

216
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,150
Stop exaggerating.

217
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,230
- Do you have time tomorrow? 
 - Huh?

218
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:08,780
I don't know... I might have to check. But why?

219
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,550
If it's all right with you, I want to take you to meet someone.

220
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,460
Meet with someone?

221
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,560
But who?

222
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,420
- My friend. 
 - Friend?

223
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,520
- Hello. 
 - You're here? Sit inside.

224
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,380
Hello, Miss Elijah.

225
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,700
I'm just Yun Su Hyeon.

226
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,260
I heard a lot from Ga On. This guy usually isn't the type to worry about anyone else.

227
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,080
- Don't distort the facts. 
 - What is your relationship?

228
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,150
- Why? 
 - We're friends. Did Ga On not tell you?

229
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,500
He didn't say that his friend was this pretty.

230
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,160
- She's pretty? 
 - Why are you laughing?

231
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,960
You're way prettier than me, Miss Elijah.

232
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,630
That's true.

233
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,110
I'm sorry I overdid, but I figured it'd be nice if you had a sister-like figure close to you.

234
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:24,210
Next time, would it be all right if we talked casually? Or you can call me "eonni."

235
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,440
That sounds good.

236
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:33,150
I don't want to. I'm not a little kid anymore. In four years, I'll be twenty.

237
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,590
That's right.

238
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,760
All right, Miss Elijah.

239
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,720
- Where's Elijah? 
 - I haven't seen her either.

240
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,980
The file that you said you found on the computer, do you have it?

241
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,310
- No. 
 - Su Hyeon, why did you ask that?

242
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,410
I was just wondering.

243
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,090
Elijah, donating a whole fortune is immoderate.

244
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,680
He might've cancelled it for you or there could've been some inaccuracy in the date while creating the computer file.

245
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,030
No, I want us to confirm things.

246
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,300
Chief, how—

247
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,410
Do you not know what abduction of a minor is?

248
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,000
Please stop this, Judge.

249
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,020
If you do anything to this child, I won't let it slide. Whoever that may be.

250
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,520
I'm all right.

251
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,670
- I won't get in. 
 - Don't act childishly.

252
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,250
- I said I won't get in! 
 - I said don't act so childishly!

253
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,330
Am I your toy? Since I'm in this state, do I look easy?

254
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,170
Did you have to go this far?

255
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,490
Elijah.

256
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,770
What are you doing? Hurry and leave.

257
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,850
I'll do it myself.

258
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,490
Nuna, I'll pour you a drink.

259
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,450
I'm going to get drunk.

260
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,090
It's all right if you get drunk.

261
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,700
What do young kids eat these days to look so pretty?

262
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,120
This is so nice, right? Nice!

263
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,250
- Hey, come here. 
 - Yes, Nuna.

264
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,070
- Are you an idol? 
 - Yes, I'm the idol.

265
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,270
I brought a present for you, Nuna. Where is it?

266
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,920
- Present? 
 - Here it is!

267
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,630
Where did you learn this stuff?

268
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,340
You're so good.

269
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,850
You're totally my style.

270
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,700
Eonnis.

271
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,950
- Eonnis! 
 - What?

272
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,740
- One second. 
 - Oh, all right.

273
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,160
Let's drink.

274
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,530
For your going on Billboard!

275
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,180
Cheers!

276
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,300
Oh my. Oh my.

277
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,200
Sit down.

278
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,780
Let's sit.

279
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,570
Minister.

280
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,760
I'll get to the point. Get ready to go to the prosecutor's office.

281
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,520
E-Eonni!

282
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,000
Eonni, what's going on?

283
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,620
It's about the shantytown land where the second complex of the Dream Village will be built.

284
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,440
I discovered you diligently bought it under borrowed names.

285
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,750
This project is supposed to save the country.

286
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,180
It's not for you to siphon confidential information to try to increase your wealth.

287
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,800
You let your greed go too far.

288
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,950
Eonni, please spare us.

289
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,200
Our relationship wasn't like this before.

290
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,160
If you were upset about something, let's clear up any misunderstandings.

291
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,830
We just...

292
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,880
thought it would be hard for you with things involving Yeong Min.

293
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,640
That's why we haven't kept in touch.

294
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,060
Our Yeong Min.

295
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,350
- Have some more fun, then leave. 
 - Eonni, it's true!

296
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,030
Eonni!

297
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,560
Minister.

298
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,990
Eonni!

299
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,070
Minister!

300
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,100
Minister

301
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey, if this is exposed,

302
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,490
then our Minbo Group will be done for.

303
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,130
Our broadcasting station made so many fund-raising broadcasts!

304
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,630
I have a headache.

305
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,900
Director Jeong!

306
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,740
- What do we do? 
 - Is there a way?

307
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:06,630
It looks like Minister Cha is feeling left out from the foundation's management.

308
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,330
Right? I thought that was it.

309
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,190
I think Master Seo will have to intervene for things to get resolved,

310
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,490
since this is related to the foundation's business.

311
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,360
Director Jeong, talk to him for us.

312
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,190
Right.

313
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:26,190
I will donate the entirety of that land to the foundation.

314
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,510
All of it?

315
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,550
Do you want a trip to the prosecutors' with your husband? Cha Gyeong Hui is ready to bury us.

316
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,620
I got it.

317
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,350
We will donate everything as well.

318
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,100
Please put in a good word for us.

319
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,800
I will do my best.

320
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,570
Since it concerns you two.

321
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,160
Seon Ah, thank you!

322
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,710
  Was that good enough? 

323
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,000
 Yes. Master Seo will also be satisfied. 

324
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,200
  But who's the real Master Seo? 

325
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,690
 Is it that old man who disappears at the drop of a hat to go into prayer? . 

326
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,700
 Or ...  

327
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,840
 Is that important? 

328
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:24,880
 Just catch Kang Yo Han, like you said you could. 

329
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,090
I'll protect you. For sure.

330
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,060
Anyhow, please stop us from being summoned by prosecutors.

331
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,650
Our kid's father looks strong, but in reality he's a coward.

332
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,500
And he suffers from angina,

333
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,960
so I don't know what might happen to him if he gets investigated.

334
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,550
My husband too.  He is camera shy

335
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,400
so he might get a panic disorder if he is put in front of the reporters.

336
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,790
Don't worry, either of you. I will do everything I can.

337
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,690
We have Master Seo with us.

338
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,870
Please just wait a little bit.

339
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,090
I will put my trust in you.

340
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,860
- If you need anything tell us. 
 - All right.

341
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,170
- Then see you tomorrow. 
 - Yes, all right.

342
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,520
- Thank you, Director Jeong! 
 - Of course.

343
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,120
"My husband", "our kid's father"... So touching.

344
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:53,310
Now, does our Young Master really have nothing to protect?

345
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,730
I need to look into it.

346
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,970
  Are you hurt anywhere? 

347
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,960
I let my guard down. She is definitely a crazy woman.

348
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,710
I will tighten the security and check Jeong Seon Ah's movements.

349
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,910
Chief, earlier—

350
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,460
Lieutenant Yun Su Hyeon, Seoul Metropolitan Investigation Unit team one.

351
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,390
Graduated in second place from the Police Academy.

352
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,520
Residing at 2700-2 in Nowon-gu, Seoul,

353
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,350
with her father, Yun Ju Won, age 64, and her mother Ju Eun Jeong, 59.

354
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,640
- What are you doing right now? 
 - You take Elijah out and make her meet a cop?

355
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,190
- That's because I thought Elijah would be lonely— 
 - I clearly told you

356
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,920
that I will not hesitate to get rid of any obstacles in my way.

357
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,360
Don't you dare. If you even lay a finger on Su Hyeon,  then—

358
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,920
I'm getting curious, what you would do if I did something to Yun Su Hyeon.

359
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,770
Su Hyeon, listen to me. First, be careful–

360
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,880
Okay, okay. I'll take care of myself.

361
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,750
I'm not joking around. It's really dangerous.

362
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,160
  Where is the chic Ga On? 

363
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,580
I'm saying you could be in danger.

364
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,870
  Speed quick service 

365
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,010
I'll call you later.

366
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,130
Who are you?

367
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,220
Hey.

368
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,570
A biker should take care of their key.

369
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,530
What are you?

370
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,360
Eonni, I caught Kim Ga On's eye as you asked. But is this really necessary?

371
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,940
- We're spreading seeds. 
 - Seeds?

372
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,880
The thing with doubt is, once it starts growing, it can't be stopped.

373
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,600
Such devotion. You do this with anything pertaining to Kang Yo Han..

374
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,700
It's fun.

375
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,150
Yes, yes I understand. Then I'll get going to the next target.

376
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,060
Good work. Then, should I get going too?

377
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,840
To spread those seeds?

378
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,230
- Take care. 
 - Yes, thank you.

379
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,950
I'll see you next time.

380
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,650
Why did you chase after such a dangerous guy?

381
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,690
Besides that, who exactly is surveilling you?

382
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,720
Wouldn't it be Kang Yo Han?

383
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,610
Kang Yo Han?

384
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:20,250
Actually, I've been meeting recently  with some people to discuss things.

385
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,060
They are worried about Kang Yo Han's actions.

386
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,450
You saw what happened in front of that restaurant last time. The kids imitating the flogging.

387
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,290
It's worrisome.

388
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:50,020
Be careful! It was dangerous, wasn't it?

389
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,140
Hello, Director Jeong. My apologies, I had my mind somewhere else.

390
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,900
By the way, what brings you to the Supreme Court?

391
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:05,590
I have to meet someone regarding the foundation. But it looks like I am lucky today.

392
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:10,290
I didn't know I would run into the person I really wanted to meet again.

393
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,070
Me?

394
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:19,850
You are really popular Judge Oh. A total star.

395
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:23,120
I'm nothing like that. Our chief is the star.

396
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,720
People keep saying you are the most humane and approachable.

397
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,030
And that you well understand the weak people's circumstances.

398
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:32,940
That's because I grew up that way.

399
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,920
I knew that would be the case.

400
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,940
People who grew up dirt-poor have a way of recognizing each other. Like a kind of radar.

401
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,720
Then you too, Director Jeong?

402
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,740
But isn't this place a bit strange?

403
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,450
What is?

404
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:05,020
Why are there only old men with solemn expressions? Without exception.

405
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,480
- Well, that's because— 
 - Be a bit ambitious.

406
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,830
I told you before, didn't I? You shined the brightest in the live court trial I watched.

407
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,950
Twinkle twinkle.

408
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,660
 Dear citizens, here comes the trial.  

409
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,490
 As Judge Kang Yo Han said,  

410
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:58,360
 we will follow the people's will and sentence the dirtbags to flogging.  

411
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,150
 - Bamboo Staff Unit! 
 - Yeah!  

412
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,650
 Catch them! 

413
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,690
 I think he's the one who stole it.  

414
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,470
 Hey, search him.  

415
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,950
 It's a pickpocket! 

416
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,470
   
 We punish the dirty hidden camera criminals, pickpockets, porn video chatroom users. 

417
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,160
 All those cancerous growths taking over Korean society! 

418
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,050
 Let's clean them up with our own hands! 

419
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,870
 - We are! 
 - The power! 
 - We are! 

420
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,090
 The power! 

421
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,490
 We're strong! 

422
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,030
 Go away! Buzz off! 

423
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:45,470
 Spray him! 

424
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,950
 Flogging, flogging, flogging! 

425
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,020
   

426
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:06,140
Doctor Safety... What are you doing instead of taking care of the factory's wastewater?

427
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:14,510
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

428
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,470
Gosh, how many zeros is that?

429
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,090
 Yes, Su Hyeon?  

430
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:25,040
- Remember Jang Gi Hyeon, "Doctor Safety"? 
 -  The witness in Ju il Do's case?  

431
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,730
I think he has a very generous sponsor among his acquaintances.

432
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,770
- Kang Yo Han? 
 -  I have to check. I will request a warrant to trace the account.  

433
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:33,990
 Su Hyeon, it's dangerous.  

434
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:38,030
Kang Yo Han has got all your personal data, from your address to your parents' names—

435
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,060
 Hey. I'm a policewoman.  

436
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,950
Should I stop everything just because some gangster knows my address?

437
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,470
 Stop saying nonsense. 

438
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,430
You want to trace Kang Yo Han's account? Are you in your right mind?

439
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,200
I explained the situation to you. It's enough to suspect him of bribing a witness—

440
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,520
You brat! Does having money in his account mean he was bribed?

441
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,280
Jang Gi Hyeon was in a poor financial situation. His salary has been garnished and—

442
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,520
Hey. What on earth are you doing these days?

443
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,470
If you rub Kang Yo Han the wrong way, you might get the entire police agency dissolved.

444
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,730
I talked to my team leader, but his reaction was strange. He got angry right away.

445
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,170
He's the one who got agitated when you said you wanted to dig into Kang Yo Han, right?

446
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,010
 Yes.  

447
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:36,360
I sent her away for now, but I don't think she'll give up easily.

448
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,300
Understood. I'll contact you later.

449
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:45,170
 They are digging into Jang Gi Hyeon's account details.  

450
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,830
What a troublesome woman.

451
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,810
 There is also a possibility they have already figured out about the transfer of funds.  

452
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,980
What should we do?

453
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,700
- Execute the plan. 
 -  Yes.  

454
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,110
It didn't look good, so I just agreed and left.

455
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,950
 I need to know how far Kang Yo Han's influence goes before I move.  

456
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:10,240
Okay, good. For now—

457
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,840
Don't you feel our Chief is a bit weird these days?

458
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,070
Why?

459
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:45,180
I selected a few possible candidates for our next live court earlier,

460
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,450
but he didn't even give my document the slightest glance, and told me to leave it there.

461
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,990
I think he has his mind elsewhere right now.

462
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:58,520
We're judges on the same bench. Shouldn't he share his concerns with us?

463
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,840
Maybe he doesn't trust us, his associate judges.

464
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,200
Is he looking down on us? What is your opinion on this, Judge Kim?

465
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,720
Judge Kim?

466
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,590
- Kim Ga On! 
 - Yes?

467
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:25,140
Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't sleep well yesterday.

468
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,210
Did you go on a date or something?

469
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:31,610
You all seem pretty free, at such a crucial time.

470
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:35,210
We should keep striking while the public is excited about it.

471
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,990
Ga On. Jang Gi Hyeon has disappeared.

472
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,540
 What are you saying? Did you go there on your own?   

473
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,260
I kept ringing the doorbell but no one was answering, so I unlocked the door and went in.

474
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,770
The house is in chaos. There are even traces of a fight.

475
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,340
Su Hyeon, hurry and get out of there for now.

476
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:58,800
Did something happen to Jang Gi Hyeon? We need to investigate as soon as—

477
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:07,040
Miss! Are you okay? Miss!

478
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,580
 Su Hyeon? Don't joke around.  

479
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,250
-  Su Hyeon?   
 - Miss, are you okay?

480
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,630
-  Su Hyeon! Su Hyeon!   
 - Wake up! What do I do?

481
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,100
Su Hyeon!

482
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,960
I had gotten his bankbook, but I got it taken from me. Jeez, what an idiot.

483
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,180
Idiot. How is that important?

484
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,600
I'm really fine. This is nothing.

485
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,330
You were making a fuss until a moment ago, asking if you might die.

486
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:49,860
That was only to check all possibilities, just in case.

487
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:55,180
She was lucky. It would have been really serious if the angle was a bit off.

488
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:07,040
Look straight at me. Are you really all right?

489
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:15,210
I did get scared. Scared I'd never see you again.

490
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:28,150
- Su Hyeon... 
 - What is going on there?

491
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,470
 We have received information that Chief Judge Kang Yo Han supplied a large sum of money to Mr. Jang, 

492
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:39,460
 the key witness in the first live court trial, Chairman Ju Il Do's case. 

493
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:44,510
In the event that he did incite perjury in exchange for money, that would be a serious crime.

494
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:50,410
 More surprisingly, the witness, Mr. Jang, is currently missing. 

495
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:55,040
The Ministry of Justice will thoroughly investigate all the suspicions surrounding the live court show

496
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,960
 and work to reveal the truth. Thank you.  

497
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,480
 What is the basis supporting this briefing?  

498
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,130
He went that far to prevent this?

499
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,450
How dare you hurt Su Hyeon? How dare you?

500
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,770
- You jumped on me like a madman just because of this? 
 - It's true you're the one behind it.

501
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,520
I never touched that childhood friend of yours.

502
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,770
- How am I supposed to believe you? 
 - Whether you do or not is your own problem.

503
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,580
Kim Ga On!

504
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,220
Don't attack me ever again.

505
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,100
Ever.

506
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:08,590
 We have received information that Chief Judge Kang Yo Han supplied a large sum of money to Mr. Jang, 

507
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:14,530
 the key witness in the first live court trial, Chairman Ju Il Do's case. 

508
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:19,130
 In the event that he did incite perjury in exchange for money, 

509
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,960
  that would be a serious crime. 

510
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,300
Yes, Jae Hui. I'm watching it right now. Good job.

511
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:30,040
 Eonni. Aren't you exploiting me too much these days?  

512
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,360
I'll report you to the labor administration.

513
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,930
You didn't do that much, why the fuss?

514
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:40,280
  ...investigate all the suspicions surrounding the live court show and work to reveal the truth. Thank you.  

515
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,480
Come on...

516
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,730
Hey. Why are you only coming now? Things are frantic.

517
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,590
Have you heard anything from the chief?

518
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,880
No way.

519
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,700
We've only just started.

520
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,700
I worked so hard to come all the way here!

521
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,710
Minister Cha.

522
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:39,580
This is an inappropriate encounter no matter how you look at it, isn't it?

523
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,140
What do you need?

524
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,410
I do have a hunch as to who handed over what documents,

525
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:49,150
but you wont be able to prove anything with just that.

526
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:54,130
Prove? Look, Judge Kang. You should know best.

527
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:59,100
In the court of public opinion, the narrative is more important than proof.

528
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,230
And isn't that already fully set up?

529
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,340
How long did you think you could live comfortably

530
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:07,280
after you've made someone cry tears of blood?

531
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,040
Tears of blood?

532
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,390
What are you doing right now?

533
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:23,990
Gosh, this is impolite, but I really can't hold it in.

534
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:27,810
I can't believe those words came from your mouth, Minister Cha.

535
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:31,800
A master of slander, fabrication, and coercion like you

536
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,400
cried tears of blood? Tears of blood?

537
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,880
Watch what you say!

538
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:55,230
I was going to propose a deal but actually, just do as you wish. As you wish.

539
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,900
Bye, then.

540
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,010
What a nutcase.

541
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,340
Have you gone crazy?

542
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,590
I will take care of it.

543
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:34,820
Take care of what? This is humiliating.

544
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,450
You dared to commit fraud on the live court that the entire nation is watching?

545
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,940
Fraud, you say?

546
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,210
A judge gave money to the witness. What else would you call that?

547
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,730
It is but a one-sided claim. Give me a chance to reveal the truth and—

548
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:54,000
The trial you presided on was in a court of public opinion.

549
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,530
It wasn't a trial that complied with the law and principle.

550
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:02,440
It is natural for the boomerang to come back to the one who threw it.

551
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,770
Public opinion is impatient and cruel.

552
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:09,900
Do you think they will quietly wait for you while you defend yourself by the law and principle?

553
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,340
That's right. If we protect you, they will throw rocks at the court.

554
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,080
Hand in your resignation immediately. As for the live court show,

555
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,800
it will be put on hold for the moment. Distribute the report materials, too.

556
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,400
Yes, sir.

557
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:28,460
You were acting so high and mighty.

558
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:47,250
Judge Kang is here!

559
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,930
Judge Kang, please say a word. Did you give money to the witness?

560
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:58,720
- Did you deceive the people? 
 - Do you know something about Jang Gi Hyeon's disappearance?

561
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,520
Even without special lighting and reflectors,

562
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,990
Kang Yo Han looks good on screen. He never looks puffy.

563
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,570
Does he get a face massage everyday?

564
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,420
He'd never be on your level though, Mr. President.

565
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,860
Well, my DNA is on quite a superior level.

566
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,320
Even at this age, I don't have enlarged pores or any wrinkles.

567
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,440
But will you be okay, Chairman Park? Didn't you say you had sold all your ads?

568
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,440
It's fine, there are many performers who can go on stage. We'll just have to cast someone else.

569
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,490
Ads are still selling well even now, anyway.

570
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:29,710
Right? Who cares about the content? As long as the earnings are high.

571
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,640
I'm scared people might hear you.

572
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,970
 I will take responsibility for everything.  

573
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,170
 I will say my last words to the citizens 

574
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,230
in the court for which I put everything on the line. I will see you later.

575
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,370
Are you admitting to the offense?

576
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:47,840
- Please say a few words. 
 - Please give us your thoughts.

577
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,870
He behaves like he's all that.

578
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:53,250
Does he think he's Na Hun Ah, Cho Yong Pil, or Seo Taiji? 
  (famous Korean singers) 

579
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,700
Why is he like this?

580
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,650
Put all channels onto Kang Yo Han.

581
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,150
And increase the unit price of adverts.

582
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:04,610
Seriously, you're so good at smelling what will bring in money.

583
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,590
He is coming!

584
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,030
Chief!

585
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,930
How can you decide this? We are judges on the bench together.

586
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:17,860
I am sorry, Judge Oh.

587
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:22,710
She is right. If responsibility needs to be taken, it should be by all of us. We'll come with you.

588
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:26,420
You are not responsible for this. Today, I am going up this stage

589
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,620
not as a judge but as a defendant.

590
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,870
Minister. Judge Kang Yo Han is holding an emergency press conference.

591
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,450
Turn it on.

592
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:03,450
I have come to stand in this court 
  Judge Kang Yo Han's public statement 

593
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,490
relying on the trust of this country's citizens.

594
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:12,920
Today, however, I am standing here with doubtful stares turned toward me from all directions.

595
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,170
 The allegations that I gave money to the witness of the wastewater discharge case 

596
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:20,490
are all true.

597
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:23,450
- What? 
 - Seriously?

598
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,520
I knew it.

599
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,690
If that's true, then that means...

600
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:31,420
 I give my deepest apologies to the citizens.  

601
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,200
Judge Kang did not do anything wrong!

602
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,740
Isn't that the witness?

603
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:07,900
Everything I said in the court that day is the truth.

604
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,700
Didn't Ju Il Do also acknowldge he had received my report on the issue?

605
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,030
 It's true I received a briefing. 

606
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:16,270
 I am sorry.  

607
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:19,770
Judge Kang took pity on me

608
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,820
after I was dismissed from the factory for being a whistleblower.

609
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,140
He felt sorry for my children

610
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,770
because we had nowhere to go but the streets

611
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:32,420
and he helped us, that is all.

612
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,550
 Transaction history / Notice of dismissal 

613
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,320
You will find out if you look into it,

614
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,520
but the payment dates are all after I was dismissed.

615
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:45,620
Judge Kang checked whether I had suffered any harm after the trial

616
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:48,180
 and he helped me because he felt sorry. 

617
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:52,910
Is that... Is that a crime?

618
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,040
No. Trust is the most important element of a trial.

619
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,670
No matter my motive, it is still true that my action was subject to misunderstanding as a judge.

620
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,860
Please put your mind at ease.

621
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:21,550
Dear citizens, please judge me.

622
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:24,160
I want to ask the citizens directly

623
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,360
whether you have trust in me.

624
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,740
 If you think I am guilty, press the red button.  

625
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,610
 If you think I am not, press the white button.  

626
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,230
If you, the citizens, do not trust me,

627
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,830
I will step down from my position as judge

628
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:43,330
right here, right now.

629
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,180
 DIKE - What is your choice?  

630
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,880
 Count of participants: 4,200,000 

631
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,270
 Vote results: 92.6% 'Innocent' 

632
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,880
What?

633
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,280
 Vote results: 7.4% 'Guilty' - 92.6% 'Innocent' - 
Participants count: 4,200,000 

634
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,740
If this is the will of the citizens, then I will follow it.

635
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:47,090
Thank you, dear citizens.

636
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,750
In that case,

637
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:57,360
I will put the totality of my assets on the line to reveal the truths

638
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,960
that the ones with power are trying to cover up.

639
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,060
Now, look at this.

640
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:08,350
 A new leap for the whole nation. A Dream Village full of hope is materialized. 

641
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:21,630
 The Dream Village of the Social Responsibility Foundation 

642
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:24,530
is the subject of a fundraising campaign targeting the entire nation.

643
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,710
But we received a tip

644
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:30,610
that the funds raised are going into the wrong pockets.

645
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:34,070
Here are the people at the core of this project.

646
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:37,940
 Social Responsibility Foundation 

647
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,170
 Board Chairman of the Social Responsibility Foundation - Seo Jeong Hak 

648
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:45,960
 Current president of the Republic of Korea - Heo Jung Se 

649
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,410
 Current Minister of Justice - Cha Gyeong Hui 

650
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,590
 Chairman of HMBN Saram Media Group - Park Du Man 

651
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:00,730
 Head of Minbo Group - Min Yong Sik 

652
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,550
Wait. Wait a minute.

653
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:11,470
Why are you airing an ad? There's breaking news right now!

654
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,410
Anyone giving us information on where the citizens' money is being spent

655
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:31,720
and the real purpose of this business

656
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,510
will receive full compensation at my own expense.

657
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,880
I promise you. Thank you.

658
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:44,530
Wait. Hey! Secretary Park!

659
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:59,690


660
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:07,900
♫  You said I'll live  in the sunlight  ♫

661
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:14,770
♫  In the sunlight, in the sunlight  ♫

662
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:19,570
 The Devil Judge
 Preview 

663
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:27,700
♫  You said I'll live in the moonlight  ♫

664
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:37,600
♫  In the moonlight, in the moonlight  ♫

665
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:47,400
♫  I went on my own path without anyone knowing  ♫

666
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,600
 It has to at least be fun if I'll have to stand at the edge of a cliff.  

667
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,760
 You seem nervous. 

668
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,660
 I should take care of it, then.  

669
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,830
 This is just a groundless suspicion.  

670
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:00,640
 Divide them. We need to shake them up first.  

671
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,650
 You are starting a fight against the nation.  

672
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,090
 This is war.  

673
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,760
 We have a courageous whistleblower who has stepped forward.  

674
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,380
 This is about Judge Kim Ga On's parents.  

675
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,650
 Don't speak carelessly.  

676
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:15,030
 The judgment of the swindler who killed your parents must have been very moving.  

677
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:18,730
 This will torment you until you die.  

678
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:21,600
 Are you hoping I will go berserk?
