00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,080
 Ji Sung   

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,360
 Kim Min Jung   

3
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,480
 Jin Young   

4
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,570
 Park Gyu Young   

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,360
 No Justice   

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,510
 The Devil Judge   

7
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,800
 This is a virtual dystopia (imaginary society with great injustice) set in Korea. All characters, organizations, events etc. are fictional   

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,680
 Previously 

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,700
 Young Master Yo Han  

10
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,870
 was an abandoned child. 

11
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,010
 Nobody wanted him. 

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,060
 Because some of us are born monsters. 

13
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,530
 Some people may be hunting for fun under a pretext of revenge. 

14
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,760
  Forget the terrible two year plague 

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,310
 terror and arson now.  

16
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,480
 The powerful and revolutionary justice plan will begin to be applied now. 

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,950
 There is a controversy over the constitutionality of this type of trial. 

18
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,600
 Who are the socially disadvantaged? 

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,590
As delegated by the people who are the sovereign of this country, the Republic of Korea, I exercise my jurisdiction.

20
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,100
 Are you saying this is the court? 

21
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,220
 There is no one here trying to resist this wind. 

22
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,510
 Are you telling me to become a Judas Iscariot?  

23
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:03,180
 Dear citizens, your court begins now. 

24
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,980
 He resembles him. 

25
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,820
 More than I thought. 

26
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,560
 You shot without hesitation. Were you intending to kill the driver? 

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,270
 If it were necessary. 

28
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,170
 Why exactly is Judge Kang Yo Han pushing the limit? 

29
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,950
 Is this trial to determine guilt? Or the opposite? 

30
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,260
 I should dig into it.  No matter what. 

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,860
 I sentence 235 years' imprisonment. 

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,150
 I thought this trial was to let off the defendant but it turned out to be the opposite. 

33
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,950
 It was touching. My eyes even teared up a little. 

34
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,220
 I think he hasn't been tamed enough. 

35
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,490
 Are you looking for this? 

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,590
 Justice will be done by the judgement of the citizens 

37
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,950
  Where am I?  Here. 

38
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,140
 Stay still. Don't roam around. 

39
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,300
  Is there something a stranger shouldn't see? 

40
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,260
 It's not good to be too nosey. 

41
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,730
 Who is this? I asked, who is this? 

42
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,500
 - Yo Han, go. 
 - I'll be right back. 

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,700
 It is Young Master Isaac, older brother of Young Master Yo Han. 

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,460
 I wonder how much you found out. 

45
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,380
 Don't pretend to be strong. 

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,610
 You don't have the courage to admit your own wounds. 

47
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,180
 You do waver when I talk like this. 

48
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,710
 Do you know how they gained power? 

49
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,670
 Turning a crisis into an opportunity is the way of people who control the world. 

50
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,660
 President! 

51
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,030
 After the outbreak of the pandemic, the foundation aggressively expanded its charity work. 

52
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,430
 - What do you plan next? 
 - Divide them. 

53
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,170
 If the world's rulers are united, there's no way to do it. 

54
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,570
 We have to shake them up first. 

55
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,530
 How about I give you a bigger prey? A chaebol? The President of Korea? 

56
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,320
 The Dream Village project of the Social Responsibility Foundation 

57
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,430
 is the subject of a fundraising campaign targeting the entire nation. 

58
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,740
 But we received a tip that the funds raised are going into the wrong pocket. 

59
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,530
 Now, if you want to reveal that Kang Yo Han's hand is fake, 

60
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,730
 you have to show your own hand. 

61
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,100
 Don't we have Master Seo? 

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,850
  it's a fight against the country. 

63
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,060
 Start with the torso. 

64
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,900
 I lived so I could return as owner of the world you had me kicked out of. 

65
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,940
 We need to meet. 

66
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,460
  Don't say, you ... 

67
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,850
 Hello, Young Master. 

68
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,330
 Your threats are meaningless. For me there is nothing to protect. 

69
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,410
 Does he really have nothing to protect ... 

70
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,730
 - Su Hyeon! 
 - ... I'll have to find out. 

71
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,260
 How dare you hurt Su Hyeon? 

72
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,140
 I never touched that childhood friend of yours. 

73
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,350
 Don't ever attack me again. Ever. 

74
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,900
 How can I believe you? 

75
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,720
 I want to show you something. 

76
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,580
 70618 Do Yeong Chun 

77
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,230
 I've never forgotten his face for a day. 

78
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,650
 This person is not Do Yeong Chun. 

79
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,770
 This is the system.  The system is powerless in the face of power. 

80
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,070
 The system in the face of a power which can manipulate whatever it pleases. 

81
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,950
 So why did you ever go there in the first place? To shake me up because I was picking fights with you and interfering? 

82
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,830
 I was hoping that you would join my side. 

83
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,200
 Choose if you are going to stand in front of me or stand by me. 

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,440
 If there is no justice in reality, but only a game,  

85
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,950
 then I also want to be among the winners. 

86
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,830
 You once asked me this. How am I going to fight against the people who control the world? 

87
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,870
 Making sure the win is certain even before the game starts. 

88
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,420
 I will promise you one thing. Your parent's enemies, 

89
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,850
 will pay dearly for what they did. 

90
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,950
 It's not just for revenge. I want to fight the world that's gone wrong. 

91
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,410
 Episode 9 

92
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,020
In the end

93
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,130
are you going to choose?

94
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,900
You're the one who forced me to choose.

95
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,120
If there is no justice in reality, but only a game,

96
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,790
then I also want to be among the winners.

97
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:49,760
 Timing and Subtitles by the Devil's Minions @ Viki 

98
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,000
"We've been working hard."

99
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,770
Put your hands up.

100
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,660
Lower the camera.

101
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,620
Are you the police? Going to shoot me?

102
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,030
Shoot.

103
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,300
You can't even shoot me anyway.

104
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,870
Throw that away right now.

105
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,530
Film this.

106
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,460
Do you regret it?

107
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,700
I will promise you one thing.

108
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,630
Your parent's enemies, those who defrauded them, and the people who switched that guy,

109
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,110
will pay dearly for what they did.

110
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,610
- It's not just for revenge. 
 - Then?

111
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,390
I want to fight the world that's gone wrong.

112
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,870
Elijah?

113
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,120
What is it?

114
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,660
 Yo Han, come here right away. We're in trouble here. 

115
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,680
Where are you? Where are you at?

116
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,900
Stay right where you are.

117
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,920
What's going on?

118
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,580
Turn off the video, but keep the audio on.

119
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,320
Are you okay? Hold onto this.

120
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,700
Mr. President, are you watching?

121
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,710
This patriotic citizen

122
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,330
was called by the President and courageously stood up.

123
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,410
This cop is persecuting me like this.

124
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,870
Stand back.

125
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,830
Shoot.

126
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,310
Hey, what the hell!

127
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,230
Hey! Hyungnim!

128
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,420
If you keep this up ...

129
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,530
- Elijah. 
 - Let go!

130
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,070
Elijah!

131
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,170
Su Hyeon!

132
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,030
Don't touch me!

133
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,090
Elijah, are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

134
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,260
It's Kang... Kang Yo Han.

135
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,370
It's Kang Yo Han.

136
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,930
I respect you, Your Honor.

137
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,450
Your Honor, I'm Ju Chan Lee.

138
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,280
You remember me, right?

139
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,910
What's he doing?

140
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,540
- Su Hyeon, are you okay? 
 - I'm okay. What are you doing here?

141
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,070
I'm okay. Are you hurt anywhere?

142
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,320
You dare to touch my niece?

143
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,550
I didn't know. I didn't... I didn't know.

144
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,990
That's enough! Are you thinking of killing him?

145
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,480
That's enough!

146
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,750
- Su Hyeon 
 - I said that's enough.

147
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,170
Su Hyeon, put the gun down.

148
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,140
Chief, you also need to stop.

149
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,670
Are you pointing the gun at me now?

150
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,970
I'm arresting him on special assault charges.  TN: It is "special" because he assaulted a police officer. 

151
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,730
This is Yun Su Hyeon. I need backup.

152
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,460
Hold onto me.

153
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,220
You should just say something.

154
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,290
Yun Su Hyeon is out of her mind. How dare she put you in danger.

155
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,000
- Unni didn't do anything wrong. 
 - Unni?

156
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,140
I told her I wanted to eat tteokbokki*, so she took me.
  (rice cakes in spicy sauce) 

157
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,110
We happened to meet those jerks on the way home. What was I supposed to do?

158
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,550
I don't have anyone to go eat tteokbokki with.

159
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,000
Did you know?

160
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,650
Chief

161
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,620
I know what you are worried about. But Su Hyeon is a good kid.

162
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,230
Not as a cop, but as one person to another, she cares for and wants to be nice to Elijah.

163
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,620
She's unnecessarily meddling.

164
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,220
How long do you think you'll be able to take care of a teenage girl by yourself?

165
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,370
I understand the impact of the church fire, but Elijah is no longer a six year old kid and

166
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,150
you can't just lock her up at home for the rest of her life— 
 - She's been kidnapped twice.

167
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,610
- What? 
 - There are a lot of people who want this family's property,

168
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,720
and there's a lot of people who have grudges against this family.

169
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,900
Elijah trusts anyone who's a little nice to her.

170
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,150
Because she's starved for affection.

171
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,670
No matter how much you hate the world and hate humans, you can't live alone.

172
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,400
You need someone to lean on.

173
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,880
Because you're human.

174
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,170
Get some rest.

175
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,220
 Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah 

176
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,130
It's my office now.

177
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,700
It's been a long way to get here.

178
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,870
 Jae Hui 

179
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,590
 - Yes, Eonni  
 - What are you doing?

180
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,150
What do you mean? I'm enjoying a glamorous personal life after work.

181
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,260
Alright, I guess you're busy.

182
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,970
 Is anything happening? If it's urgent, I'll go. 

183
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,690
No.

184
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,970
I was thinking we should have a glass of champagne together.

185
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,850
Unni, as the chairwoman of the powerful Social Responsibility Foundation,

186
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,960
 don't you have someone to share a glass of champagne with? 

187
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,940
 Don't be so self-conscious and have fun. 

188
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,070
 Do you want me to call the models? 

189
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,790
No, that's okay.

190
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,400
Have fun.

191
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,940
Models?

192
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,930
That sounds fun.

193
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,610
Chief.

194
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,780
- What's going on? 
 - I just got a call from Su Hyeon.

195
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,950
All of the Bamboo Spear members have been released.

196
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,370
They were all released?

197
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,540
The Police Commissioner ordered it in person.

198
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,160
What the hell are they, to make the Commissioner take action himself?

199
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,190
They aren't just simple-minded idiots?

200
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,900
Yes?

201
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,170
Yes, I understand.

202
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,000
The Chief Justice wants to see us. All three of us.

203
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,720
Pardon?

204
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,340
That's very new and original.

205
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,610
They're here. Have a seat.

206
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,130
The head of our live court operation support group is very motivated.

207
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,240
First, using you as the models, she said she is going to film

208
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,700
the live court's promotional video and posters.

209
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,770
We need to increase your media exposure. To make people more enthusiastic.

210
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,050
To make them go crazy admiring, loving,

211
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,000
and desiring Judge Kang. Just as I do.

212
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,140
Our team support leader is good at making jokes too.

213
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,440
I'm not joking.

214
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,650
Be a puppet in front of the public. Is this what you are saying?

215
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,730
Chief Kang, why are you being so perverse?

216
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,080
The Foundation said they'd support us.

217
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,560
In times like this, we need to raise the court's status. Stop complaining and just cooperate.

218
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,180
As expected, Chief Justice, you know what you're talking about.

219
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,460
I'm sorry, but I don't think this is a judge's job.

220
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,850
I don't think it would be a bad idea to reach out to people in a friendly way.

221
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,040
Is it really the live court show that you want to promote?

222
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,180
Of course it is. Why are you asking that?

223
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,370
There have been some awkward incidents so, although I appreciate it, I can't believe

224
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,490
the foundation is suddenly supporting us.

225
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,450
Then, do you have any promotional slogans in mind?

226
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,560
Strong law and order. A safe Republic of Korea.

227
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,440
We will do the live court show with you.

228
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,430
That's the slogan that the President is shouting these days.

229
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,470
Are you uncomfortable?

230
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,820
Don't tell me, are you against the government's policy?

231
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,710
Sounds interesting.

232
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,180
Let's give it a try.

233
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,360
Chief.

234
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,230
Oh my, Young Master. Are you even seeing me off?

235
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,110
Was my warning insufficient?

236
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,300
I told you I am not a very patient person.

237
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,390
Oh, that? I'm all right.

238
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,970
I don't have any scars.

239
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,440
If you interfere with my work, you will pay the price.

240
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,050
It seems you've been working pretty hard to get where you are.

241
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,270
Will it be all right with you?

242
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,240
Interfering?

243
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,090
I'm helping you right now.

244
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,770
A survivor of a tragic accident, a judge who mercilessly punishes evil ...

245
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,950
I like it all. Because people naturally love those kind of stories.

246
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,970
But wouldn't it be more fun if the game got bigger?

247
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,640
Now there are only two years left until the presidential election.

248
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,330
Instead of people like Heo Jung Se, Cha Gyeong Hui,

249
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,470
you should take over this country.

250
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,860
That suits you, being at the top and brilliantly shining.

251
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,540
So?

252
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,460
Use it. Use the foundation.

253
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,120
This is interesting.

254
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,110
Be a shepherd dog instead of a wolf.

255
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,220
With you.

256
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,830
There are a lot of things that the public would go crazy about.

257
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,970
Child abusers, rapists, and gangsters.

258
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,650
If you are dealing with disposing of trash like that, then I will make you an even bigger hero.

259
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,060
The foundation can make anyone first-in-command.

260
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,340
We even made trash like Heo Jung Se first-in-command.

261
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,940
If you wait two more years, you'll be with me—

262
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,750
I like it all but I don't like that part.

263
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,430
With you.

264
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,390
You should have thought of my preferences.

265
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,530
Young Master.

266
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,410
Can't you be a little kind to me?

267
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,760
See you later.

268
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,740
- I thought we'd have a drink. 
 - Thank you.

269
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,650
They had no other army of occupation after all.

270
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,710
They're going to use us for what they want.

271
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,090
It's not a bad thing to pretend to be easy on them. By doing that, we can find a crack.

272
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,360
That's true, but suddenly doing promotion? It's no joke.

273
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,440
It's going to be a joke.

274
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,870
That's the way she is.

275
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,930
What?

276
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,710
Do you know Chairwoman Jeong Seon Ah well?

277
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,040
Do you perhaps have some connection with her from the past?

278
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,400
We had. That was also in this house.

279
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,000
- Here? 
 - Didn't the nanny tell you?

280
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,930
About that maid. The one who jumped.

281
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,920
Was that true?

282
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,290
That you were playing with people's feelings?

283
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,790
As expected, you're just like him.

284
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,800
What are you talking about now?

285
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,870
Judging things from the outside.

286
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,990
 Why on earth did you do that? 

287
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,810
 They said she almost died. 

288
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,410
 She might not be able to walk again. 

289
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,100
 Yo Han, I'm really worried about you. 

290
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,270
 With what happened at the school too, if you keep going on like that you'll end up in serious trouble. 

291
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,700
 If this keeps happening, I don't know what Father will do to you... 

292
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,140
 Yo Han, make a promise to me. 

293
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,030
 That you won't hurt innocent people.  

294
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,130
 This,  

295
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,630
 every time you see this, think about the promise you made to me. 

296
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,350
 All right? 

297
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,650
Wow.

298
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,590
My brother was always that kind of person.

299
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,290
He didn't understand until he died.

300
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,110
That there is no innocent human being in this world.

301
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,660
 Republic of Korea 
 The Blue House 

302
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,590
- Mr. President. 
 - Yes?

303
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,500
There doesn't seem to be any progress in the investigation

304
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,230
of the radical organization behind the embezzlement of donation.

305
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,310
I know you. Reporter Park,

306
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,700
why are you being so impatient? Is the organization an organization for no reason?

307
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,020
We call it organization, because an organization hides things organizationally, using its organization.

308
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,570
Give us some time. Our investigative agency is competent. All right.

309
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,950
Yes?

310
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:20,280
These days, there are more and more people following the internet broadcasts of the Bamboo Spear,

311
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,150
who act as vigilantes and go around mass assaulting people.

312
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,600
There's a tip that the cops are sitting on their hands pretending they haven't seen anything. What do you think of it?

313
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,660
That's— That's fake news.

314
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,480
Don't you know that? Who the hell says that?

315
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,090
What newspaper are you from? Are you a real reporter?s

316
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,120
Secretary Choi, what are you doing, really?

317
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,440
- Do you let all the dogs and cows in? 
 - I apologize.

318
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,660
What are you doing now?!

319
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,360
Aren't you working? Are all of you out?

320
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,650
You there, the woman reporter. Are you smiling?

321
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,840
Hey, you think you're smart, don't you?

322
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,470
 The country is idly standing by as internet broadcasters carry out mass assault? The President absolutely denies it.  

323
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:09,510
That kind of thing, that's called the President? That piece of shit.

324
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,060
I think the Blue House is in a hurry.

325
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,310
He tries to get through this trouble with irrational ways, so it's no wonder he is in a hurry.

326
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,330
It was a mistake to put him in that seat in the first place.

327
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,060
Because of that old man, Seo Jeong Hak.

328
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,460
 Dear patriots, whom I love and respect, is this, is this a country? 
   
    

329
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,320
 Our precious people are dying of plague one after another. 

330
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,990
 The privileged class, those bastards born with a silver spoon in their mouth and provided with the best education, 

331
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:40,460
 doesn't care a bit about us common people. 

332
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,330
 Someone who's never done dirty politics, someone fresh, 

333
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,270
 your dirt spoon* candidate, your celebrity, your choice, 
 (=of poor origins) 

334
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,800
 this Heo Jung Se, 

335
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,990
 will, without fail, raise up the Republic of Korea. 

336
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:00,480
 I'll risk my life for Korea's Total Change! 

337
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,740
 Good job, candidate Heo Jung Se from the common people. 

338
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,550
 It's true he is an ordinary guy. 

339
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,320
 Master Seo, that...  Master Seo, as you said, would I  

340
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,780
 make out in the tough world of politics? 

341
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,150
 Well, that's enough for you not to be embarrassed in the election. 

342
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,670
 Actually, I'm pretty good at live performances. Please believe me. 

343
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,530
 - All right, good job. 
 - Thank you. 

344
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,780
 Salute! Salute! Salute! 

345
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,120
 Salute! Salute! 

346
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,720
 Would it really be all right to go with that man? 

347
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,790
 She's right. He is just a fellow who used to host the foundation events, acting like a clown. 

348
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:56,040
 - And now he'll be a presidential candidate? 
 - But still, he used to be a famous actor in his own way. 

349
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,470
 Is it 'So Refreshing!'? It's doing really well. Over six million views.  

350
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,670
 In times of crisis, a clown like him fits well. 

351
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,540
 Even if you become president now, 

352
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,080
 and if you don't subdue the epidemic, you'll just suffer throughout your term. 

353
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,240
 Why do you want to take the bullet by stepping forward?  

354
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,180
 You could be controlling everything from behind, right? 

355
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,170
 Isn't that so? Assemblywoman Cha? 

356
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,860
He didn't want some big shot president. And it turned out it wasn't Seo Jeong Hak,

357
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,120
but the mere secretary standing behind him.

358
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:44,240
 Strong Law and Order 
 A Safe Korea 

359
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,210
I'm sorry. I'm a bit late.

360
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,550
It's not a big deal. We're in the middle of setting things up, Chairwoman.

361
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,890
But are there only two light fixtures?

362
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,300
Aren't they a bit weak?

363
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,980
Even so, our judges look amazing.

364
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,240
Perfect.

365
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,530
You like it?

366
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,370
Yes.

367
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,480
Don't overdo it.

368
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,890
Okay.

369
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,960
All right, let's get started now.

370
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,650
Judges, please get ready.

371
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,550
All right, staff stay out.

372
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,860
Okay, lights. Please hold your pose.

373
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,430
- Yes, go ahead. 
 - I'm getting started.

374
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,950
Be natural.

375
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,880
One.

376
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,630
You're doing great.

377
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,020
One more. Look at the camera.

378
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,360
That's good. Judge Kim, smile brightly please.

379
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,280
At least cross your arms.

380
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,720
Cross my arms.

381
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,600
Judge Kim, your face is too stiff.

382
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,080
Try using your dramatically handsome looking face to look nice.

383
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,360
Do it naturally. Laugh.

384
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,780
As expected, our diva.

385
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,080
Then can I stand in the middle this time?

386
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,640
- Yes, sure. 
 - Thank you.

387
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,150
Judge Oh knows what a composite is. You're really the best!

388
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,250
I'm sorry, I'm getting a call.

389
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,900
Yes.

390
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,360
- Did you get what I told you? 
  - Yes. 

391
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,900
I collected all the data on Jeong Seon Ah's past activities.

392
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,360
As you said, should I leak this to Cha Gyeong Hui's side?

393
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,770
Yes.

394
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,200
And hide the source.

395
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,700
Oh! Include this too.

396
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,790
She was a maid at our house.

397
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:44,020
Minister, information came in from the team working on Jeong Seon Ah.

398
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:57,500
This woman, this woman is really interesting.

399
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,600
Ajumeoni!

400
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,010
Young Master Ga On.

401
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,240
Where's the coffee...

402
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,430
I will prepare it for you. What kind of coffee beans would you like?

403
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,410
It's all right. I'll do it.

404
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,180
I like making my life easier.

405
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,870
Yes, of course.

406
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,820
  
 We punish the dirty hidden camera criminals, pickpockets, porn video chatroom users,  

407
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,480
 All those cancerous growths taking over Korean society, 

408
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,450
 let's clean them up with our own hands! 

409
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,160
 - We are! 
 - The Power! 
 - We are! 
 - The Power! 

410
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,820
 Flogging! Flogging! Flogging! 

411
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,260
What's that?

412
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,170
Aren't they those crazy bastards from that time?

413
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,460
Elijah.

414
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,550
Why are you watching this scumbag's video?

415
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,650
Just looking at him, you can tell he's a loser. What power...

416
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,060
There were seven other violent incidents following that loser just yesterday.

417
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,760
Also,

418
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,660
this kind of video was uploaded today.

419
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,560
 Shoot me if you want to. 

420
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,470
 Can the police ... 

421
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,020
 point a gun at an unarmed citizen's chest? 

422
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,700
 Are you not ashamed?! 

423
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,950
Wow, seriously... Posing as the victim?!

424
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,310
I can't believe it.

425
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,650
Let's quickly catch this man. Should I help you?

426
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,020
No, I'll try to figure it out, first.

427
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,410
Okay.

428
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:26,650
Just in case, if you are too tired, you have to tell me.

429
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,870
Understood?

430
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,670
Okay. Thank you.

431
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,430
Ajumma, are you cooking right now?

432
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,920
Why? Yo Han told you not to cook.

433
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,710
I'm cooking for Young Master Ga On.

434
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,990
Young Master Ga On has never told me not to.

435
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,760
I'd grateful if you made something for me.

436
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,590
- Elijah, let's eat together. 
 - Huh?

437
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,060
Oh, no I'm fine, I'm all right.

438
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,250
- But still, Ajumeoni is putting the effort to prepare— 
 - I really don't like Korean food!

439
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,720
Are you a goldfish? You can't even remember what someone says.

440
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,320
That...

441
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,750
I'm sorry, Ajumeoni. I shouldn't have said anything.

442
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,260
Don't mention it. I'm used to it.

443
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,220
Actually, Miss Elijah has gotten a lot brighter.

444
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,430
Is that so?

445
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,500
She's never been so active in talking to someone

446
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,230
or asking them what they're going to do.

447
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,840
Since that accident.

448
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,950
It's all thanks to Young Master Ga On.

449
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,480
I'm blunt by nature,

450
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,180
so I can't thank you,  but I can express it by doing this.

451
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,920
Will he be okay?

452
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,290
Oh, whatever.

453
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,940
You're very good at it.

454
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:34,290
Well, I just prepared something simple. Please, eat.

455
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,410
Thank you for the meal.

456
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,620
I don't know if the seasoning suits your taste.

457
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,760
Well... the seasoning...

458
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,490
tastes very new to me.

459
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,590
Well, it's probably hard for common families to get to taste it.

460
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,840
I put in rare wild honey for your health.

461
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,190
Oh, wild honey.

462
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,120
You put wild honey in doenjang jigae (soybean paste stew).

463
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,260
Wow, you're amazing.

464
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,750
It's ginseng kimchi.

465
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,200
I added a lot of truffle oil, so the quality is different.

466
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,610
- Oh... truffle oil... 
 - Isn't it good?

467
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,950
Ah, but

468
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,580
- Ajumeoni.  
 - Yes, go ahead.

469
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,360
When did the Chief stop you from preparing the meals?

470
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,800
He started eating less and less,

471
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,000
and at some point he told me not to cook anymore.

472
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,520
He used to empty his bowls without a complaint.

473
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,640
He's probably suspicious of me.

474
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,330
Without a word of complaint...

475
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,270
Please eat.

476
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,700
Oh, it's because it's still so hot.

477
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,530
But still...

478
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,730
Eat it with the ginseng kimchi.

479
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,720
So you don't like Korean food?

480
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,520
I guess you've emptied out all the food. You look pale.

481
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,610
Why didn't you stop me?

482
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,380
How could I do that?

483
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,910
When she's been working so hard to prepare it.

484
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,880
She goes around looking for anything that is good for us.

485
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,130
Foolish Ajumma.

486
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,280
That's why you used to eat everything without complaining.

487
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,680
Both of you.

488
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,670
You leaked the information on Jeong Seon Ah to Cha Gyeong Hui's people, right?

489
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,690
Yes, I did as you instructed me to.

490
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,280
They are probably collecting any  and all information on the foundation.

491
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,530
I need to get that from them somehow.

492
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,530
Elijah, what's wrong?

493
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,240
  - When are you coming? 
 - What?

494
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,660
When are you coming?  I am hungry.

495
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,410
  - What are you saying right now— 
 - Ga On made dinner.

496
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,420
But he said he won't serve anyone until all of us are present.

497
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,730
 So hurry up and come home. 

498
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,610
- Let's go home.
 - Pardon?  Then today's appointment...

499
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,000
- It's all right to put it off for a day. 
 - Understood.

500
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,630
♫  From far away, the blowing wind  ♫

501
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:07,370
♫  Whereabout will it quiet down?  ♫

502
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:14,910
♫  Oooh Your night 

503
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:21,660
♫  Oooh shines on me  ♫

504
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:29,210
♫  ♫  My feelings which are returning to you again are confused  ♫  ♫

505
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:36,390
♫  You still haven't come and I waited for you  ♫

506
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:44,110
♫  On the dark street, I am listening for you and I hear you  ♫

507
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:52,450
♫  You still haven't come and I waited for you again  ♫

508
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,990
Did you call for me?

509
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,330
- We need to catch him now. 
 - Who are you talking about?

510
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:35,440
Your enemy.  And the person who hid him.

511
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:43,330
 A Safe Korea 
 This is my pledge. 

512
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,090
Did you find Do Yeong Chun?

513
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,830
Did you find the evidence that Cha Gyeong Hui switched him with someone else?

514
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:52,320
Not yet.  But I found out whom I need to question.

515
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,880
Attorney Go here did.

516
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,350
Attorney Go did?

517
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,980
He's doing a lot for us.

518
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,320
Getting information from the prosecutor's office and leaking information to them.

519
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,870
There are so many prosecutors wanting to come to our law firm.

520
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:13,210
Someone whom cautious Cha Gyeong Hui can trust enough to run that kind of errand for her ...

521
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,160
There is only one person like that, her personal secretary.

522
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,030
He's been using an official vehicle for a business trip to the province once a month.

523
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:23,880
I see.  Is that secretary the very loyal type?

524
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,630
 He's been her aide for ten years since her days as assemblywoman. 

525
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,460
 He's her right-hand man. 

526
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,760
 It seems it won't be easy to get him to talk. 

527
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,400
Still, we should try.  First, we will need to secure that secretary somehow—

528
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,020
That's my job.  And I've already started on it.

529
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,270
Then, I will try to get him to talk.

530
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:56,130
- How will you do that? 
 - You have a lot of money, don't you Chief?

531
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,950
Didn't you say that money is very powerful motive?

532
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,250
Are you awake?

533
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,390
Judge Kim Ga On?  What the hell are you doing now?

534
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,750
I want to have a conversation with you.

535
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:55,250
About the man in his 50s whose whereabouts you regularly check on and report to the minister.

536
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,360
What are you talking about?  I don't know anything about it.

537
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,910
You already know, don't you?

538
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,730
His name is Do Yeong Chun, and he is a pyramid scheme conman.

539
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,330
My parents were his victims and died because of him.

540
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:11,160
What does that have to do with me that you are doing this?

541
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,830
Of course I didn't expect you to have something like a conscience.

542
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,900
Pure gold bar produced in Switzerland, 500 million won (≈$435,000) each.

543
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:35,470
One billion... 500 million.  1.5 billion won (≈$1,300,000).

544
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:41,090
Would this much buy your loyalty to Cha Gyeong Hui?

545
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,250
Is it not enough?

546
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,820
2 billion won (≈$1,735,000).

547
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,240
Stop being ridiculous.  Do you think I will betray the minister for this?

548
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,800
2.5 billion won (≈$2,170,000).

549
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,220
Do you think I serve her because of money?

550
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,690
She is someone who will lead the country.

551
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,740
- You will regret it. 
 - Do whatever you want.

552
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,950
My belief will not change.

553
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,050
You are still doing this?

554
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,480
Judge Kang Yo Han?

555
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,020
I give you the tools but you don't even know how to use them.

556
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:46,130
Okay, here is 2.5 billion won.  Are you going to talk?

557
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,980
- What do you think I am?
 - Very well.

558
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,180
Okay, 2 billion won.  Are you going to talk?

559
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,950
- Ah...
 - Okay, 1.5 billion won.  I am a busy man.

560
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,540
Hold on... hold on.

561
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,930
- Let me think—
 - 1 billion won.

562
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,270
No...

563
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,820
I will tell you.

564
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,460
I will tell you everything.

565
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:27,480
♫  Need something stronger  ♫

566
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:33,300
♫  I want to find some love  ♫

567
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:39,900
♫  Need something stronger  ♫

568
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:46,010
♫  Well abiding  ♫

569
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,130
I didn't know it would be that simple.

570
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:59,110
People feel greater pain when something they had is taken away from them.

571
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,520
 1901 Dabu Blvd, Danwon-Gu, Ahnsan City 

572
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,930
To think that Do Yeong Chun is hiding at a place like this...

573
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:33,200
Don't expect too much.  We are here just to observe today.

574
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,020
Let's come back after we decide how to take care of him and make preparations.

575
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,860
Oh, put it there, put it there.

576
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,410
Honey!

577
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,980
- It's a chicken stew. 
 - Oh, it looks delicious. The best! Eat a lot today.

578
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,990
The older you get, the more you need this protein.

579
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:14,820
I eat well on my own. You eat a lot.

580
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,330
It's hard doing all the farming.

581
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,760
Are you guys newlyweds? I got goosebumps.

582
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,030
Hey, I'm guilty of doing many bad things to your mother.

583
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:26,000
- How about me? 
 - To you, too!

584
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,790
Okay, okay. Eat all of this, eat all of this.

585
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,490
Eat all of it.

586
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,720
It's seasoned well.

587
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,350
It's delicious. Hey, there's a bug.

588
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,600
Honey, really?

589
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,280
Are you surprised?

590
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,510
Kim Ga On, don't be impatient.

591
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:41,050
This guy is the best bait to catch Cha Gyeong Hui.

592
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,130
Is it because it's someone else's business?

593
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:48,090
You think only your planned hunting is important, don't you? Do you know how I feel now?

594
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,670
It's not only about your own revenge.

595
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:57,680
Cha Gyeong Hui framed many innocent people and destroyed them to go up to that position.

596
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,650
The father of the friend who helps me took his own life

597
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,370
after being framed by Prosecutor Cha Gyeong Hui for bribery and sexual assault.

598
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:09,490
And ... After you get blood on your hands,

599
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,860
how do you think you're going to face your friend?

600
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,890
 Execute Do Yeong Chun! 
    

601
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,930
 Execute him! Execute him! 
    

602
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,450
 I'm guilty of doing many bad things to your mother. 
 - Don't do it. 

603
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:47,490
 Don't throw your life away because of a guy like that. It's not worth it, Ga On. 

604
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,350
Ga On.

605
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,080
Su Hyeon.

606
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:26,660
What's up? Weekday lunch? What's with the clothes?

607
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,490
I took a day off.

608
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,110
Why?

609
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,150
I've missed you.

610
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,030
Are you out of your mind?

611
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:40,330
How did you... come up such a praiseworthy idea?

612
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,420
- It's delicious. 
 - It's delicious.

613
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,800
- What flavor is yours? 
 - Banana.

614
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:07,320
Ah, this is good. I wish every day were like today.

615
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,180
- Su Hyeon. 
 - Yes?

616
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,500
If, really, if I happened to...

617
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,330
do something bad, what would you think?

618
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,490
Do something bad?

619
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,730
Here? All of a sudden?

620
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:32,220
No, not that kind of the bad. A really bad thing. Crime.

621
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,940
What's it? What nonsense are you asking? I'll handcuff you with my own hands right away.

622
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,920
How can a judge commit the crime?

623
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,360
Do you think I'm going to just sit and watch that?

624
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,030
I know, right?

625
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,370
Of course you should, because that's you.

626
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,480
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

627
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,030
Something happened to you again, right?

628
00:56:55,030 --> 00:57:00,280
No, I just wanted to say something weird while looking at you.

629
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:11,820
Has he been on a drinking cycle? Why is he like this again?

630
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,820
Who are you?

631
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,420
Are you atoning?

632
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,380
Who are you?

633
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:15,170
Who said you can pretend to atone as you wish?

634
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:18,280
How many people died because of you?

635
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:24,960
Are you a victim?

636
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,910
I have committed a crime worthy of death.

637
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,670
I am sorry.

638
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:40,280
Don't be ridiculous. Do you think I'll be fooled?

639
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,880
What kind of person are you?

640
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,710
Where did you hide all that money, to be doing this show now?

641
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,640
Oh, no, no.

642
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,350
Most of them was seized, but the rest of the money was...

643
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:59,350
Minister Cha Gyeong Hui took it all away.

644
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:03,940
I don't have anything now.

645
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,070
Even if I want to atone,

646
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,750
there is no way to pay for the damage.

647
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:13,490
I've been waiting for the day to go to hell.

648
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:20,430
Welcome. I'm...

649
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:24,060
please kill me.

650
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:36,260
Yes, you have to go to hell.

651
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,660
I'll grant your wish.

652
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:52,200
Die.

653
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,130
Die!

654
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,490
Honey! Who are you?

655
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,310
Who are you, acting like this? Honey! Honey!

656
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:04,220
Why are you doing this to him? Honey! Honey!

657
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,320
- Die! 
 - Honey! Spare him! Spare him!

658
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,820
Dad!

659
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,830
Spare him! Spare him!

660
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,480
Don't do this.

661
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,300
Who are you? What's wrong with you?

662
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,000
Kill me instead!

663
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,540
Please.

664
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,660
Dad...Dad...

665
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,310
Please spare my dad.

666
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:40,730
Please let him live. Honey! Please spare him.

667
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:49,220
Who told you to atone as you please? Who told you so!

668
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:53,980
Why can't you even make me take revenge? Why?

669
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,170
I am sorry.

670
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,960
You don't deserve to be human.

671
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,760
You should have been the devil.

672
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:10,420
You should still be the devil!

673
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,750
I am sorry.

674
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,450
I'm sorry.

675
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,100
I'm sorry.

676
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,110
Let go!

677
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:30,910
Let go! Let go!

678
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:37,200
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?

679
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,010
- Get out! 
 - Honey!

680
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,730
Honey! Honey!

681
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,470
Honey!

682
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,050
Let's stop the clumsy play.

683
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,470
My money... my money! My money!

684
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:04,980
My money! My money!

685
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,520
My money... my money!

686
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,320
My money! My money! My money!

687
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,800
Are you looking for this?

688
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,550
My money!

689
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,750
My money! My money! My money!

690
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,210
My... money...

691
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,050
Hold on to this guy.

692
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:33,950
My money! My money! My money!

693
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,050
My money!

694
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:43,600
Stop!

695
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,130
Hey, don't do it. My money!

696
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,460
Stop. My money....

697
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,990
Hey! Hey, you punk!

698
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:55,580
- Chief! Chief! 
 - There are people in there!

699
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,490
- There are people in there! 
 - Don't do it!

700
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,090
- Open the door! 
 - Dad! Dad!

701
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:00,960
Chief!

702
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,090
Help!

703
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:05,350
Help!

704
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,440
What is he doing?

705
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,190
- Kang Yo Han! 
 - Don't do it!

706
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,640
Open it!

707
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,570
Stop! Stop.

708
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:18,260
I'm just trying to give him a chance.

709
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,000
- Save me. Stop! 
 - Stop!

710
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,520
No!

711
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,340
Hey! Hey!

712
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,560
Honey! Save us!

713
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,110
No! No!

714
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,820
No, no.

715
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,890
Hey! My money! My money! My money!

716
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,800
Honey! Honey! Save us!

717
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,130
Stop it.

718
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:59,600
Save us!

719
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,290
Let go! Let go!

720
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,650
Calm down and look at him.

721
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:07,350
My money!

722
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:11,170
My money...my money! My money!

723
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:15,250
Hey! Hey!

724
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,280
My money!  My money!

725
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,900
My money!  My money!

726
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:27,110
My money! My money! My money!

727
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,520
My... my money! My money!

728
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,970
Save us!

729
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:35,790
My money! My money!

730
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,190
What is this? It's fake!

731
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,590
Hey!

732
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:58,950
This isn't my money. This isn't my money!

733
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,910
We have to save them!

734
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:08,020
Calm down. Look at who he really is.

735
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,880
Honey, Honey.

736
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,180
 Save us! Honey! Honey, save us! 

737
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:30,430
 Let's get out. 

738
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:33,740
I mean, this is...

739
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,730
I mean...

740
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,400
I, this... how...

741
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,410
He even lied to his family.

742
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:44,180
He told them he didn't have any money left.

743
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:46,730
Seo Jin. Seo Jin.

744
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:50,000
Dad had no other choice but to do this.

745
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,640
I really uh... I... Seo Jin...

746
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,920
Honey, Honey. I'll explain it to you.

747
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,390
Hey!

748
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,620
Don't go! Don't go, damn it!

749
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,690
Don't go! Don't go.

750
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:13,490
Honey.

751
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,770
Honey!

752
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:20,820
Now, if you want revenge, do it.

753
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,820
Do not hesitate.

754
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,460
Spare me, please.

755
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:34,130
I am sorry. Please spare me.

756
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,790
I was wrong.  Again... this... I...

757
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:40,520
I didn't do this. This isn't my money.

758
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,930
Spare me. I was wrong.

759
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:46,980
I was... I was wrong. I was wrong.

760
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,940
I was wrong.

761
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,390
Spare me, please.

762
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:24,510
My money!

763
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:43,940
He's the only bait if we want to catch Cha Gyeong Hui, isn't he?

764
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,860
Let's not waste it.

765
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:49,670
My money!

766
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,620
Let go! Let go!

767
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,520
But where's the real money?

768
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,190
It's intact, exactly where he had buried it.

769
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,080
Were you trying to trick him?

770
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:33,520
I told you. If people think they're losing what they have,

771
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,890
they will lose their mind.

772
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,930
Hey, eat a little bit. Just one bite, all right?

773
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,280
Mom, have some.

774
