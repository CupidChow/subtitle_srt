00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,010
Please don't come! Judge, please!

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,120
Please!

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,440
Judge, don't come!

12
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,520
Judge, don't come! Please.

13
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,040
Judge, don't come! Please. No, you can't! It's dangerous.

14
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,560
 I said not to come!

Put that down.

17
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,800
I want

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,390
you to be lonely, like me.

19
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,440
Then wouldn't you stay by my side?

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,110
If there's no one by your side.

21
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,310
Professor!

24
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,980
Someone help me! No! Ajeossi!

25
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,920
  We're angry about the reconstruction that kills the common people. We oppose, oppose and oppose it again! 

26
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,460
That...

27
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,430
Are you all right? Come out of here.

28
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,190
Yes. Thank you.

29
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,190
Go this way.

30
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,960
Ga On! It's been awhile!

31
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,520
It's me.  Don't you remember me?

32
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,900
It's been a while.

33
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,250
Get him.

34
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,110
I am going to kill you,

35
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,770
so that you die a lonely

36
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,190
and miserable death.

37
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,460
In a way that suits you very well.

38
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,540
Does it hurt a lot?

39
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,890
Oh, dear.

40
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,380
You should go rescue Judge Kim Ga On.

41
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,080
You should go to the Hyeongsan-dong slum.

42
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,020
I told you.

43
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,750
I want you to be so lonely you could die.

44
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,080
Lieutenant Yun. It's Kang Yo Han.

45
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,020
- What is this about? 
   - Kim Ga On is in danger right now. Find him.  

46
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,360
- What? 
 - Hyeongsan-Dong slum. Right now.

47
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,460
Your life is also as disappointing as mine.

48
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,960
It was almost over.

49
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,590
You just had to live your own life.

50
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,690
 The subscriber you're calling is not available... 

51
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,970
Elijah, why don't you answer the phone?

52
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,680
Elijah...

53
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,180
Come here!

54
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,790
Kim Ga On!

55
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,990
Excuse me!

56
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,980
Get off!

57
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,630
 Oh, my judge.

- Su Hyeon...  
 - All's fine if you aren't hurt.

61
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,780
But what were you doing here?

62
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,790
I received a strange phone call.

63
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,750
Telling me to go there if I wanted to save Professor Min.

64
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,480
What are you talking about? I talked with him on the phone just this morning.

65
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,660
He is resting well at the hospital.

66
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,650
Is that so?

67
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,280
So, that Bamboo Spear punk must have lied to lure me there.

68
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,810
But ... how did you know to go there?

69
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,260
I just...

70
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,200
I heard it on the police radio.

71
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,560
 Dear citizens, the plague virus has been found again in the residential area of the Hyeongsan-dong area. 

72
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,510
We can overcome it.

73
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,980
 No matter what difficulties we face, we must overcome it.
   

74
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,670
Judge.

75
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,410
Judge, please wake up.

76
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,990
Judge, you have to wake up.

77
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,930
Judge.

78
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,470
Judge, wake up.

79
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,520
Judge.

80
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,770
Judge, you have to get up.

81
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,110
 Judge, Judge— 

82
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,450
How do you feel?

83
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,300
We stopped the bleeding as best as we could.

84
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,290
Are you all right?

85
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,570
Our people are being attacked all at the same time.

86
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,360
We were worried for you too.

87
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,410
We found you by tracing your location.

88
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,690
But we can't reach Han So Yeon.

89
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,960
Han...

90
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,810
You two, go find Han So Yeon.

91
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,450
Hello?

92
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,330
Why don't you answer the phone?

93
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,120
You startled me!

94
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,990
 Why are you yelling at me? Of course I couldn't answer because I was sleeping. 

95
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,840
Listen to me carefully. If anyone comes, don't open the door.

96
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,450
Just stay in your room. Get it?

97
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,910
Understood.

98
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:14,050
 Hyeonsan-dong, where the plague virus has been discovered again, is a residential area for the poor. 

99
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:19,660
 The government and the Social Responsibility Foundation, will move the people of Hyeonsan-dong safely to the Dream Village– 

100
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,000
 How did you know that I like this? 

101
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,010
 It tastes good. 

102
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,960
 Where did you buy this from? 

103
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,910
 You and I have the same taste. 

104
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,980
 It's good. 

105
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,180
Here you are.

106
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,940
You are late, Judge Kang.

107
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,890
She said strange guys were in front of the house.

108
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,260
We would have been in big trouble if Chairwoman Jeong were not there.

109
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,760
I heard you asked her to come.

110
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,620
Yes, I did. Thank you.

111
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,490
Don't mention it.

112
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,940
I will spread it for you.

113
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,960
  I want you to be lonely, like me. 

114
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,910
Have some.

115
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,560
Thank you.

116
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,550
Elijah, go to your room.

117
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,610
I have important things to talk about with  Chairwoman Jeong.

118
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,550
No, don't.

119
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,950
We've only just got to know each other a little bit, right?

120
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,790
This eonni is interesting.

121
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,220
I think we get along well because we are similar.

122
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,940
Right? We are quite similar.

123
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,540
We are smart and relentless.

124
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,640
We're a little broken.

125
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,010
 It's only the beginning, Young Master.  

126
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,030
Still, let's not cross the line.

127
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,760
Oh, look at me.

128
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,090
I'm being too friendly, how silly of me.

129
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,350
Sorry, miss Elijah.

130
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,040
I'll get going then.

131
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,990
What's wrong with her? She is weird.

132
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,930
Why are you sweating that much?

133
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,130
Did something happen?

134
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,320
No.

135
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,560
What is that? Isn't that blood?

136
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,570
It's all right.

137
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,460
Everything is fine now, Elijah.

138
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,010
Everything is fine now.

139
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,000
Everything is fine now.

140
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,990
You said you weren't hurt.

141
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm sorry, Su Hyeon.

142
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,210
For what?

143
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,330
For showing you this side of myself.

144
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,350
When Cha Gyeong Hui died.

145
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,510
You don't need to say that.

146
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,590
I'm not that great a policewoman anyway.

147
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,430
I know Kang Yo Han's method isn't right

148
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,270
and that it's a crime for a judge to do such a thing.

149
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,180
But I cannot bear it.

150
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,260
If I didn't do this at least, I would go out of my mind.

151
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,060
I don't even deserve to be by your side.

152
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,020
I've only shown you this kind of a pathetic side ever since we were young.

153
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,230
And yet, shamelessly,

154
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,140
because I thought I couldn't live without you,

155
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,550
because I thought I would actually die...

156
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,440
What foolish talk.

157
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,750
I can't stand it, really.

158
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,360
Until when do I have to listen to this nonsense?

159
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,980
- Su Hyeon... 
- Don't you really know?

160
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,210
I don't care about what you deserve or not.

161
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,090
Right or wrong, I don't know what's happening to the world.

162
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,330
Please,

163
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,970
just please stop throwing yourself in danger.

164
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,930
Don't cry,

165
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,860
don't be unhappy,

166
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,650
and don't screw up your life by doing such things.

167
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,980
That's all I need, Ga On.

168
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,120
I just need you.

169
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,970
Ga On.

170
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,380
I'll get going. I have to check on the situation out there.

171
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,430
You behave and stay here.

172
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,420
You never know when we might be attacked. See you.

173
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,680
Su Hyeon that...

174
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,720
- See you. 
 - Su Hyeon...

175
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,230
Ah, the Bamboo Spear guy ... Was it Bamboo Spear? That young man does a really good job.

176
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,890
He's very bold with his work.

177
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,410
The speed at which he works is no joke.

178
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,520
I told you. Kids who have nothing to lose are usually good at their jobs.

179
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,700
Chairman Jeong, Did you properly take care of the people who were assisting Judge Kang Yo Han?

180
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,790
Yes.  We put almost all of them on the emergency relief bus.

181
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,580
Because people are the most precious.

182
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,970
So, you know, that people are precious.

183
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,220
Yes?

184
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,140
It looks like the disaster broadcast is over.

185
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,720
Thank you for your hard work this time.

186
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,220
Judge Oh, you have reassured the citizens

187
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,090
with great confidence!

188
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,340
Applause!

189
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,590
But how serious is the situation?

190
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,430
I heard it's a highly lethal strain of the virus.

191
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,660
It's a residential area for the common people, how much damage did it cause?

192
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,930
Don't worry too much about that.

193
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:44,030
Emergency measures are being implemented extensively.

194
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,140
Then I'm not just going to do the broadcast and

195
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,180
- I'll go to the relief site myself and help– 
 - Oh, oh, oh ...

196
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,200
Let's leave that to the experts, right?

197
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,980
Of course.

198
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,590
Yes, all right.

199
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,510
Then I will go back.

200
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,850
Our Judge Oh, you should be getting ready.

201
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,870
Excuse me?

202
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,820
Get ready to be appointed as the presiding judge.

203
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,600
Have a drink with us.

204
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,540
 The Social Responsibility Foundation is adding additional resources 

205
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,640
 as the project of relocation to the Dream Village  

206
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
  is progressing faster than expected  

207
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,700
 due to the mutant virus incident in Hyeongsan-dong. 

208
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,950
Don't push yourself too hard and rest. Then I'll be going.

209
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,720
- Thank you. 
  - They disclosed  

210
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,480
  that they will help develop a cure for the plague virus. 

211
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,370
 Citizens who wish to make a donation 

212
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,860
 can check the official website of the Social Responsibility Foundation 

213
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,490
 for more specific ways to do so. 

214
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,580
 We look forward to your participation. 

215
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,750
Are you all right? How in the world did you get hurt like that?

216
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,220
It's nothing.

217
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,170
- Really? 
 - Yes.

218
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,190
Don't worry. I'll be healthy

219
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,010
until you are able to stand up on your own feet and kill me.

220
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,850
What the hell!

221
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,890
What are you saying? Who said anything about worrying about you?

222
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:36,120
  Here's the next item.  President Heo Jung Se will issue an emergency statement right now. 

223
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,670
 Please listen to the government's announcement of its position 

224
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:45,000
 on the current strain of the plague virus in Hyeongsan-dong. 

225
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,380
 - Hello?  
 - Lawyer Go.

226
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,070
How are you feeling, Judge? Are you all right?

227
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,130
Yes, I'm all right.

228
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,010
Did you find miss Han So Yeon?

229
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,080
 What about the other aides? 

230
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,110
I think they were taken by the foundation people.

231
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,550
 They are now taking citizens away under the pretext of emergency relief. 

232
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,510
 It's an emergency where the citizen's lives are at risk. 

233
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,330
 As of now, 
   

234
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,180
 all newspapers and broadcasts must be subject to government control, 

235
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:21,610
 and all traffic after 10 p.m. will be prohibited. 

236
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,450
 The government has arrested 
   

237
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,760
 and is currently investigating all those 

238
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,760
 insurgents, who caused social unrest 

239
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,460
 by spreading false rumors earlier this morning. 

240
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,360
 - We can't reach Han So Yeon. 
 - Did you find miss Han So Yeon? 

241
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,190
 I think they've been taken by the foundation people. 

242
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,340
 Enduring such a big tragedy ten years ago. 

243
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,980
 My heart hurts whenever I see Judge Kang. 

244
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,750
 Please don't come here! 

245
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,050
 Are you telling me to live with it 

246
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,100
 because I don't have much of a future? 

247
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,910
 Is this how you do it? How are you going to fight the people who move the world 

248
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,230
 by alienating the people right next to you? 

249
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,560
 That's how I do things and that won't change in the future. 

250
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,860
 You know well what kind of bastards we're dealing with. 

251
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,790
 Now they're going to become tougher. 

252
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,430
 I don't know what's going to happen. 

253
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,790
 I have never mistaken myself to be just. 

254
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,620
 I'm just making a choice. 

255
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,750
 Judge Kang Yo Han is now driving this country 

256
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,890
 into madness and violence. 

257
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,230
 Any behavior which interferes with the emergency quarantine and emergency relief 

258
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,610
 shall be considered equivalent to murder   
 

259
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,420
 and will be punished with the maximum penalty. 

260
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,850
 And then what if the sword is turned towards you? 

261
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,640
 Turning a crisis into an opportunity,  

262
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,290
 that's the method used by those who move the world. 

263
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,930
 I can't stand the hypocrisy of those people. 

264
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,240
 It makes me sick. 

265
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,030
 A monster? You don't have the courage to admit to your wounds. 

266
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,590
 Do you think this fight is a joke?! 

267
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,990
 You have to stop. 

268
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,900
 You are ruining the world. 

269
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,220
 Everyone, don't be afraid. 

270
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,570
 We are bound to win. 

271
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,160
 We will overcome this crisis 

272
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,010
 and show the world that 

273
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,950
 we are the greatest race. 

274
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:56,890
 So everyone, please believe in me and the country. 

275
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,490
 Yo Han, make a promise to me. 

276
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,190
 Make a promise to me. 

277
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,170
 That you won't hurt innocent people. 

278
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,460
 That you won't hurt innocent people. 

279
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,280
 I'm sorry, Hyeong. 

280
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,090
 I can't keep my promise. 

281
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,920
 The Social Responsibility Foundation now has a heavy responsibility 

282
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,730
 to prevent the spread of the plague virus throughout Seoul. 

283
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:34,460
 They are doing their best to move the residents of Hyeongsan-dong 

284
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,930
 to the Dream Village for treatment and relief. 

285
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:41,320
 The Social Responsibility Foundation, which is working in cooperation with the government, Jeong Seon– 

286
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,360
Judge Kim.

287
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,660
Those are all blatant lies.

288
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,800
Do you know what's going on outside?

289
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
What are you talking about all of the sudden?

290
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,570
It's all crazy because of the virus.

291
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,700
They are dragging people away by force, like animals.

292
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,320
That news? It's all fake. It was fabricated by the foundation.

293
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,720
Does that make sense?

294
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,250
It is what I personally saw and suffered myself.

295
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:09,760
It's the Bamboo Spears' doing. They are swinging iron pipes at people.

296
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,860
You were attacked?

297
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,890
Do you know what scares me more?

298
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,630
No matter how much I think about it,

299
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,790
I think all this talk about discovering the plague virus is a lie.

300
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,040
Wait a minute.

301
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,740
Are you sane right now?

302
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,110
While talking about a deadly strain virus with a high fatality rate,

303
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,020
they put Bamboo Spears, who are no different from street thugs, on the front line.

304
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,300
Without any hazmat suit and just pretending to wear masks. Think about it.

305
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,880
That man, Bamboo Spear, was the manager of Heo Jung Se's private organization.

306
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,930
He's put a criminal with an electronic anklet

307
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,430
on the front line of quarantine in a state of emergency?

308
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,330
Judge Oh.

309
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,950
Judge Oh, you're being used.

310
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,520
All over the streets, your video–

311
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm sorry, but you seem too excited right now.

312
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,550
I don't know what kind of excessive force was used at the site,

313
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,410
but are you asking me to believe what you said?

314
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,590
- Don't you think you've gone too far? 
 - Judge Oh.

315
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,750
We need more calm and orderly measures in times like this.

316
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,500
I'm just helping with that.

317
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,540
You're not in court. Is something going on?

318
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,480
 I heard you got hurt. 

319
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,980
I'm fine. More importantly, do you know what's going on right now?

320
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,460
If you're fine, then that's enough. We'll talk about it later.

321
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,940
Hell–? Hello?

322
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,430
Come in.

323
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,610
Judge Kang, sit down. Sit down.

324
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:13,270
I'm not someone with bad proportions, but I don't look cool wearing this.

325
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:19,380
It's so lame. Advancements need to be made starting from things like these.

326
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,300
What have you started?

327
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,690
"What"?

328
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,140
It's to protect the country and the people against the epidemic.

329
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,720
Using a private organization to force the poor out.

330
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,090
Is that what you are talking about?

331
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,230
Then what am I supposed to do? Should we just kill all 10 million people in Seoul,

332
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:44,090
because of the human rights of a little over 10,000 people?

333
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,270
Isn't one thousand a greater number than one?

334
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,780
Someone who passed the bar, can't do simple arithmetic?

335
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:54,300
And people will love it, when this is over. Why?

336
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,820
Because Seoul will be cleaner and the price of apartments will go up.

337
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,700
That's what human beings are all about.

338
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,730
Does a virus even exist?

339
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,780
Come to think of it, you're a real lunatic.

340
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:24,320
Hey, during this national crisis, you can still tell me such a ridiculous joke?

341
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,460
I won't say much.

342
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,320
Stop what you are doing right now.

343
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,320
I am telling you to call it off.

344
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,600
What if I don't stop?

345
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,020
I'll put you guys on trial and

346
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,480
find out about everything that you are up to.

347
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,650
Until the angry crowd turns this place into a sea of fire

348
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,180
and drags you out like a dog.

349
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:11,500
People who are really beaten like dogs tend to howl so loudly.

350
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,200
Do you think your randomly throwing things out like that without any evidence is going to work?

351
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,750
You're kidding me. You've got to be kidding me.

352
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:25,830
The citizens are terrified right now. Whom do you think they'll believe?

353
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,640
I'm telling them to stay at home because strangers are dangerous!

354
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,960
You are telling them to run out on the streets and save a stranger!

355
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Whom do you think they will choose?

356
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,380
I think you're overreacting because you're popular with the public.

357
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,690
Don't be ridiculous! Don't flatter yourself!

358
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,910
There is no difference between the people who are crazy about you

359
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,680
and those who made me president.

360
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,700
People will be people. Do you know that?

361
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,320
Listen to me carefully. Let me say something very erudite.

362
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,980
The people who conceived me

363
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,250
are also the ones who gave birth to you, you son of a bitch.

364
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,650
Don't you know that? Huh?

365
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,720
If you are really going to test your luck,

366
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,060
yellow suits you very well.

367
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:46,340
 POLICE 

368
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,030
This is a restricted area. Step back.

369
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:56,280
- Judge? 
 - It's going smoothly in there, right? 
 - Excuse me?

370
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,510
Open it up for her.

371
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,240
 Dear citizens, the plague virus has been found again in the residential area of the Hyeongsan-dong slum. 

372
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:19,980
 No matter what difficulties we face, we can certainly overcome them. 

373
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,760
 Dear citizens, the plague virus has been found again 

374
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,540
 in the residential area of the Hyeongsan-dong slum. 

375
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,250
 We can get through this again. 

376
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:39,140
 No matter what difficulties we face, we can certainly overcome them. 

377
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,990
 - Miss Policewoman?  
 - Yes, Grandma?

378
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:07,820
You said anything is fine, you told me to call you if anything came to mind.

379
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,400
 - Ah, that man who was in charge of the church, Joseph.  
 - Yes.

380
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,270
Someone said that they saw someone who looked like Joseph in a neighborhood in Seoul,

381
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,970
but I'm not sure about this.

382
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,900
It's all right, so please tell me everything.

383
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,820
Yes.

384
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,670
- Ga On. 
 - You're here.

385
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,540
I told you to behave and stay at home. Why are you out here?

386
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,470
I just thought you would be coming.

387
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,390
Shut up. Let's hurry in.

388
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,190
Su Hyeon.

389
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,430
About what happened during the day.

390
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,240
What- what- what- do you mean, nothing happened.

391
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,350
I won't apologize. But

392
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,830
I think the order was wrong.

393
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,260
The order?

394
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,940
Do you know I'm a terrible coward?

395
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,460
I've been scared to death all day.

396
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,850
What if we suddenly become awkward with each other?

397
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,310
What if it becomes uncomfortable?

398
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
I've been like that all my life.

399
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,300
I thought what if we

400
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,150
date and

401
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,890
fight over trifles like everyone else,

402
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,900
have misunderstandings, get jealous, get upset,

403
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,530
and

404
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,170
break up. What then?

405
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,430
I only have you.

406
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,340
If I lose you too, I won't have anyone.

407
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,170
So, if we're not in a relationship as a man and woman, but friends,

408
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,900
I thought that if I just remained your best friend in the whole world,

409
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,590
I wouldn't be lonely for the rest of my life.

410
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,050
It's stupid, right?

411
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,600
It's selfish too.

412
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,930
But I can't take it anymore. I don't need anything else.

413
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,520
I just want to fight over trifles like everyone else,

414
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,990
have misunderstandings, get jealous, be upset, and

415
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,980
I want to love you forever.

416
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,560
I really love you, Su Hyeon.

417
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:20,390
♫  I who am in this dream within a dream  ♫

418
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:27,980
♫  am suspended endlessly  ♫

419
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:34,800
♫  Ooh seeing you  ♫

420
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:42,520
♫  Ooh wakes me up  ♫

421
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,120
♫  Ι don't understand my feelings that are returning to you once more  ♫

422
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,840
♫  Ι don't understand my feelings that are returning to you once more  ♫

423
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,590
♫  You still haven't come  ♫

424
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,990
♫  And I waited for you  ♫

425
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,590
♫  On the dark street  ♫

426
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,680
♫  I am listening for you and I hear you  ♫

427
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,380
♫  You still haven't come   ♫

428
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,710
♫  And I waited for you again  ♫

429
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,650
♫  Ι don't understand my feelings that are returning to you once more  ♫

430
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,400
♫  Ι don't understand my feelings that are returning to you once more  ♫

431
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,970
♫  You still haven't come   ♫

432
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,720
♫  and I waited for you  ♫

433
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:37,110
♫  On the dark street, I am listening to you  ♫

434
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,900
♫  On the street tonight  ♫

435
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,850
♫  I waited for you again  ♫

436
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,900
Kang Yo Han, that guy ...

437
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:58,190
Could he really be holding onto something?

438
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:04,940
Quarantine authorities, media, prosecutors, the police. Aren't we in control of all of them?

439
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,480
The virus or whatever, if we say it exists, then it exists. If we say it doesn't, then it doesn't.

440
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,380
How can they prove that it doesn't exist?

441
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,040
It's not like he is carrying a microscope and examining it himself.

442
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,350
But it's a bit uncomfortable.

443
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:19,380
I mean, I just feel like it would be great

444
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,840
to bury him someplace no one knows.

445
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,120
But then the whole country will be turned upside down.

446
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,940
Chairman Jeong, if you have any good ideas, tell us.

447
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:39,700
If someone doesn't heed the warning, we should blow them up.

448
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,750
That's exactly how I feel, but if we do that—

449
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,550
Let's start with the stage first.

450
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,810
Stage?

451
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,680
A star is a star who shines when on stage.

452
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:58,610
When there's no stage, they're just an ordinary person.

453
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,110
Ga On. Ga On, hurry and get up.

454
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,020
 The government has decided to dismantle the existing live court,  

455
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,660
 and set up a new emergency court 

456
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,380
 to respond to this national emergency. 
 "National crisis, emergency court established." 

457
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,610
 The cases under the jurisdiction of the emergency court 

458
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,640
are acts of interference with the emergency quarantine and relief measures,

459
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,900
scaremongering, illegal rallies and demonstrations.

460
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,960
Judge Oh Jin Ju has been appointed as the presiding judge of the emergency court

461
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,770
 and she will select associate judges out of candidates who have 

462
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,640
 strong national views. 

463
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,130
That is all.

464
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,030
Su Hyeon, we have to stop this.

465
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:43,200
Those people are fooling all the citizens.

466
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,450
The only person who can prevent this is the Chief Judge.

467
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,410
Ga On, it can't be Kang Yo Han. Strange things are happening now

468
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,800
so how can you trust him? He's a dangerous person.

469
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,470
- Su Hyeon— 
 - Just wait a little bit.

470
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,650
Please wait a little more. I'll find out who Kang Yo Han really is.

471
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,990
We're almost there, Ga On.

472
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,860
Su Hyeon, please, just this once, trust me.

473
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,800
This situation has to be stopped somehow.

474
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,400
We will figure what kind of person Kang Yo Han is after this.

475
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,380
Su Hyeon.

476
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,220
Will that be possible?

477
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,230
I'll have to do it even if it's not possible.

478
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,580
Last, I will try to mobilize all of the remaining aides.

479
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,950
There is one person who can enter the main control room.

480
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,610
Chief.

481
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:45,340
I'll call you back, Lawyer Go.

482
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,160
Are you going to stay like this? Right now, out there,

483
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,880
innocent people are being beaten up and dragged away like dogs.

484
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,780
Are you just going to watch it?

485
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,570
Please say something—

486
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,780
Is anyone home?

487
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,710
- Hello. 
 - Hello, I wanted to ask a few things.

488
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,020
I don't know.

489
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,420
Is anyone home?

490
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,650
Is anyone home?

491
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:20,880
Oh, congratulations, Judge Oh. I mean, Your Honor, of the emergency court.

492
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,470
Later you have to become the Supreme Court Justice and then the Chief Justice.

493
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,100
I will make all of that happen for you.

494
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,150
If you're going to make it happen, how about you make it right?

495
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,540
Judge Kang Yo Han is still popular one way or another.

496
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,410
If I want to be the presiding judge, then I have to overcome that popularity.

497
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,740
Don't you remember Kang Yo Han's inaugural speech?

498
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,940
When he said, "I am the power."

499
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,210
So your starting has to be more impactful?

500
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,950
Exactly. What you see is everything. The image.

501
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,030
But it's not something that can be achieved with just a letter of appointment.

502
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,730
This is nepotism after all.

503
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,580
And also I'll be someone who suddenly took away a senior's position.

504
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,890
What can we do for you? Would you like to make an inaugural speech?

505
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,290
Yes! At the place where Kang Yo Han did.

506
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,700
Putting Kang Yo Han and Kim Ga On in the back.

507
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,290
Will Kang Yo Han accept it?

508
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,160
I'll convince him.

509
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,560
"Chief, I can't send you away like that".

510
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,470
"I will prepare a short farewell broadcast".

511
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:35,910
"I will honor your achievements myself".

512
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,770
You want to have a coronation?

513
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:45,890
One where Kang Yo Han himself puts the crown on your head.

514
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,090
Wouldn't that look pretty good?

515
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,360
The viewer ratings would also turn out well.

516
00:48:55,370 --> 00:49:00,080
If it's this hot a topic on a regular broadcast, well the audience ratings...

517
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,870
This is driving me crazy.

518
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,700
The viewer ratings for a show have been this high for the first time in my life.

519
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,540
Does it really have to end this way?

520
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,580
So are we getting fired too?

521
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,200
I heard they are making an emergency court.

522
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,340
Hey! Would you watch something like that? Huh?

523
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,060
It's not as if it's an emergency military court martial.

524
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,160
Yes, Judge Oh. Yes. Yes.

525
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,050
I am tearfully grateful to you Judge Oh.

526
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:50,670
Please don't misunderstand. I'm being sincere. Please accept it.

527
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:58,800
Excuse me. This happened because of the sudden emergency situation,

528
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,000
but wouldn't the live court start again shortly after it's all over?

529
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,630
Until then, we'll leave it to our Judge Oh for just a short while, and then it will resume as before.

530
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,340
If you present it this way, I think it will look good when you come back.

531
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,310
Do you need bridesmaids, newbie Judge?

532
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,280
- Oh, Judge Kim, don't be like that. 
 - Let's do it.

533
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,300
Chief.

534
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,290
But you have to do a good job so that it all appears congenial.

535
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,860
You have to think about my position too.

536
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:29,000
You don't have to worry about that. I'll put my career on the line and do my best!

537
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,390
Is anyone home?

538
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,110
Yes?

539
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,890
- Hello, I'm from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit. 
 - Yes.

540
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,130
Someone called Jeong Joseph—

541
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,760
That person doesn't live here.

542
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,050
Have you perhaps seen someone like this in the neighborhood?

543
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,970
I haven't!  What is this situation anyway?

544
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,820
Is anyone home?

545
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,460
Who?

546
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,090
Mr. Jeong Joseph?

547
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,170
Just a moment. I'm Yun Su Hyeon from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

548
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,300
No matter how much you think about it, don't you think the ratings will skyrocket?

549
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,590
I mean, they're all going to be sitting in the corner of their rooms watching TV anyway.

550
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:55,350
- She must want to have something to eat first. 
 - What?

551
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:59,120
She's been going the wrong way since earlier.

552
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,610
Ah, you're right? That's strange, we didn't talk about that.

553
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,770
Maybe she wants to go to the restroom?

554
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,380
Yes, Judge Oh.

555
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,840
 We have some free time, right? Let's have something to eat. 

556
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,250
Ah, yes, all right, let's do that. Yes.

557
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,690
She wants to eat first.

558
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,560
- Check the ad time. 
 - Yes, sir.

559
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,510
You can't come in here.

560
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,850
Oh? Who are you people?

561
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,780
We are all set.

562
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:48,970
What amazing thing does she want to eat? I don't even see any restaurants here.

563
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,790
I'm sorry,  Producer.

564
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:59,140
Instead, I'll make sure that the ratings are a hit. You have my promise.

565
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,650
Oh, yes, that's...

566
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,080
What is this?

567
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,530
What is this?

568
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,830
What are they doing?

569
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,400
We have to show what is happening now.

570
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,820
 Count me in. 

571
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,480
 Judge Oh. 

572
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,550
 Judge Kim, I saw the scene too. 

573
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,310
 I know that saying that I didn't know won't atone for my deeds. 

574
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,900
 I'll do anything.  I will do everything I can. 

575
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:14,920
 Are you really sure, anything? 

576
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,290
 Yes, Chief. 

577
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:21,750
 Perfect. It's more natural this way. 

578
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,080
Looks like I will have to do that.

579
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,880
If you're seeing things like this,

580
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,550
and not pointing the camera there, then you're not a broadcaster.

581
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,420
Everyone gather here!

582
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,790
- What is it? 
- Nak Hyeon!

583
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,490
You go there and bring the equipment down.

584
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:49,590
I'm sorry for changing the broadcast plan,

585
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,670
just trust me and follow me.

586
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,770
You are trustworthy.

587
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,910
Let's go do the Live Court now.

588
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,840
Live Court?

589
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,020
Wear this first.

590
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,470
We have to go on stage.

591
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:15,170
♫  You said I'll live in the moonlight  ♫

592
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:24,950
♫  In the moonlight, in the moonlight  ♫

593
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:34,140
♫  I went my own way without anyone knowing  ♫

594
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:43,520
♫  The lights that were shining above my head  ♫

595
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,370
♫  I was born in a twisted place  ♫

596
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:51,380
I'll take charge of things here, Judge Kang.

597
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,570
Thank you.

598
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:02,900
♫  That's when I met you  ♫

599
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,530
Get the camera higher, on the rooftop.

600
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,620
Yes, they're going up to the rooftop now.

601
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,940
Okay, be careful. All right, Team A, focus on our judges.

602
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,970
And Team B and C will show the details of the scene.

603
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,860
All right, B and C focus on the big scene. In detail!

604
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,870
I'm going to follow Judge Kang. When is the power generator coming?

605
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:39,750
I don' t think we can get the power generator car on such a short not– 
 - The sun is going down! I'll take responsibility for it!

606
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:45,710
- Hey, hold on, hold on. 
 - Everyone!

607
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,880
Everyone!

608
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:51,010
Everyone!

609
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:59,240
Citizens! This is the emergency relief site in Hyeongsan-dong.

610
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,260
Oh! What's that?

611
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,620
 As you can see, this is the truth! 

612
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:12,350
 Live court reveals the reality of the emergency relief site in Hyeongsan-dong. 

613
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,920
Oh my! Is that real?

614
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,370
All the videos you've seen so far are fabricated.

615
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,510
The government is hiding the truth and committing national violence!

616
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:26,580
CEO, just what are you broadcasting right now?! What?!  
   

617
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,140
 Are you out of your mind? 

618
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,730
No, it's not that...

619
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:34,820
Stop talking nonsense and hurry! Stop it right now! Hurry this instant!

620
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,270
Damn!

621
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:40,340
Call Bamboo Spear and tell him to take care of Kang Yo Han quickly.

622
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,420
Do you understand?

623
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:47,620
- What are you doing?! If you get paid as a public servant, then get to work! 
 - Yes, sir.

624
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,680
Citizens! Everyone, please open the DIKE app.

625
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,020
And be the judge.

626
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,680
 Live broadcast of Hyeongsan-dong's relief site on DIKE app. 
 What's your choice? 

627
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:23,120
Hey, you punk! Come here!

628
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,780
Throw rocks!

629
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,370
Go after them!

630
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,820
 How could they? 

631
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:46,310
Everyone! At this very moment, your neighbors are dying.

632
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,980
Are you just going to sit and watch?

633
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,900
The government is blindfolding you.

634
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,390
Now open your eyes!

635
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,030
Open the door!

636
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,520
- Open the door! 
 - Move over!

637
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,110
There is no response.

638
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,960
Are you okay, Ga On?

639
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,280
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, I'm all right.

640
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,250
Please continue.

641
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,450
 Judge Kim Ga On  has been struck. 

642
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,350
Ga On.

643
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,670
Director! This way.

644
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

645
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,420
Chief.

646
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,580
The judge was hit by a stone.

647
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,060
He said the judge was struck by a stone.

648
01:01:56,590 --> 01:02:00,190
Hey you! You will be punished by Heaven!

649
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:03,760
No, no, no, old man, stay still.

650
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,110
Grandp– That man...

651
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,550
You can't!

652
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:24,260
♫  No matter how  ♫

653
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:27,740
Kang Yo Han! 
 ♫  much I shout  ♫

654
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:35,500
♫  to reach out and save me I can't breathe  ♫

655
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:42,110
Come... down! Come down! Come down! Come down!

656
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:47,290
Come down! Come down! Come down!

657
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,860
Kim Chung Sik!

658
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:57,680
♫  I cannot stop it anymore, it swallows me whole  ♫

659
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,000
♫  Save me from myself  ♫

660
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,790
Now you have to come down.

661
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,100
Yes?

662
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,880
Come down.

663
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,520
Damn it! All you have to do is cut off the electricity at the broadcasting station and the area! 
  Government using indiscriminate violence against residents of Hyeongsan-dong. 

664
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,620
Cut it off! Just cut off all the electricity!

665
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:35,620
Tell me you're kidding me.

666
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:43,190
Wow! I'm just going to destroy all the TVs, and kill all the bastards at the broadcasting station!

667
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:48,380
 Government using indiscriminate violence against residents of Hyeongsan-dong... A shocking scene. 

668
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,940
What?

669
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,420
- Oh! It's still on the DIKE app. 
 - Oh, really?

670
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,720
- I think the lights went out over there, too. 
 - Oh, you're right.

671
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,680
Are the lights ready over there? Okay, ready.

672
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,590
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

673
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,450
Look at his phone over there.

674
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:03,550
Let's also take out our cell phones.

675
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:06,580
- Turn it on. 
 - Excuse me? 
 - That's right.

676
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,690
- What's going on? 
 - What's going on?

677
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:11,150

 - Turn if off now!

678
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,040
- Turn off the light! 
 - Turn off the light!

679
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,390
So what? You turned on the lights. So what?

680
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,320
What?!

681
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,740
Turn on the light on my signal.

682
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,500
Turn off the light!

683
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,100
Turn off the light!

684
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,650
- Ready... Go! 
 - Darkness

685
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,410
cannot defeat the light.

686
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,770
Okay. Number two, get ready.

687
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,280
Darkness!

688
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:21,990
Cannot beat the light, everyone!

689
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,280
Go!

690
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,250

What's this?

01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:24,960
He's really a disgusting bastard.

Are you hurt?

706
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:10,880
No, Su Hyeon, no.

707
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,260
I told you not to get hurt. Why are you going around getting hurt?

708
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,970
No.

709
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,160
I told you don't cry.

710
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,610
Don't get hurt, Ga On.

711
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,470
No.

712
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:32,930
Su Hyeon.

713
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:38,690
G-Ga On, I love you.

 Devil Judge Preview 
 We thank actor Park Hyeong Su for his special appearance. 

724
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:44,780
♫  From far away, the blowing wind  ♫

725
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:51,970
♫  Where will it quiet down?  ♫

726
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:53,900
♫  Ooh your night ♫

727
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,020
 It's going to be hell. 

728
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:59,030
 I know it too, as I am living in it.  

729
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:03,880
 If there is anyone is trying to stop this trial, they're the criminal. 

730
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,980
 You have to cut the tail first. 

731
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,390
 Don't tell me you have some sort of lingering attachment? 

732
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:13,410
 Because you need the blood of a victim to make people fight. 

733
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:16,870
 That's what Kang Yo Han really wants. 

734
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:20,830
 - Fear. 
 - Are you sure of who killed Su Hyeon? 

735
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:23,540
 The price of a life is life! 

736
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:26,250
 I propose the death penalty! 

737
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:32,100
♫  Ooh seeing you  ♫
