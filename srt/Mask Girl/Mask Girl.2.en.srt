1
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,028
My name is Oh-nam Ju.

2
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,823
I like spending time alone.

3
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,659
It's been like that

4
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,953
since I was a child.

5
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,292
When I was young,

6
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,711
the other kids
made fun of me and bullied me.

7
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,630
Go, go, go!

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:52,635
In the world of children, you are degraded
because of how small and chubby you are.

9
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,266
Spin more, more, more!

10
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,023
As I started middle school,
nothing changed.

11
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,108
- It's mine!
- What you talking about?

12
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,028
- I'm gonna eat it first!
- It's mine. Leave it!

13
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,739
The only way
I was able to get along with them at all

14
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,326
was to remain as invisible as possible.

15
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,579
When I allowed myself to be seen,

16
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,499
the bullying resumed
exactly where it left off.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,597
I gradually became terrified
of people's gazes on me.

18
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,100
And I slowly

19
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,061
disappeared completely.

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,482
Nobody was around to listen to me.

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,818
Except her.

22
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,949
I love you. I love you.

23
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,743
I love you.

24
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,123
I love you too.

25
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:55,568
MASK GIRL

26
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,948
OH-NAM JU

27
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,035
Thanks, Remi-chan.

28
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,580
Eh?!

29
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,833
You even got a present for me?

30
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,753
You didn't have to.

31
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,300
Anyway, thanks, Remi-chan!

32
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,099
It's so cute!

33
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,613
Ah, shit.

34
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,574
Hello, Ma.

35
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,661
What the hell took you so long to pick up?

36
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,372
I called in the morning,
but you didn't pick up once!

37
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,541
Do you know what day it is today?

38
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,293
Today is...

39
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,937
- Didn't I tell you I was...
- ...my birthday.

40
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,081
...taking a trip
to Jeju Island with my church today?

41
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,130
Oh, right.

42
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,592
God, what am I supposed to do with you?!

43
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,178
You know Du-sik, right? Mrs. Yang's son?

44
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,722
The one who became a doctor.

45
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,890
You know what he did?

46
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,435
He gave money and bought clothes
for his mother's trip! That's what.

47
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,645
Do I really have to spell it out for you?

48
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,772
I... I'm sorry.

49
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,067
Du-sik even got married to a doctor
as well, for heaven's sake.

50
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,487
Apparently, they both adore Du-sik's mom
and look after her health.

51
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,781
I hear from everyone
that he's the best son around,

52
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
and I'm so sick and tired of hearing it!

53
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,076
And then, there's you.

54
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,787
How come you've never had a girlfriend
in your life?

55
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,415
What was that? Did you just sigh?

56
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,042
It was just a yawn.

57
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,711
Look at you!
You're just lying over and over again.

58
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,006
When I raised you alone without a husband,
I didn't have many wishes.

59
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,592
All I wished for
was a grandson to hold in my arms.

60
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,761
You're not even able to do that for me.

61
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,231
I'm still alone.

62
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,444
I'm still afraid of people.

63
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,952
I am...

64
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,457
especially afraid
of meeting a woman's eyes.

65
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,340
Mr. Oh-nam. Here you go.

66
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
DOCUMENT FOR APPROVAL

67
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,222
So I prefer looking at a woman's hands

68
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,141
rather than her face.

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,311
This woman has moles on both her hands.

70
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,022
In the exact same spot.

71
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,444
Hmm! She got new nails today.

72
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,118
But here,

73
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,495
I was very

74
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,288
different.

75
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,964
All right,
let's have a look at all my cuties.

76
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,343
Daddy will shower you
with tons of Heart Pangs.

77
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,430
I had a personal
favorite among all of them.

78
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,640
Mask Girl.

79
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:02,482
It's a bummer that she covers her face,
but she provides the best service!

80
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,067
GIFT HEART PANGS

81
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,199
Ah! Once Upon A Prince,
I'm so touch...

82
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,956
They were in the same spot
and were the same size!

83
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,750
Even her nails were the same!

84
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:25,755
That was when she became special to me!

85
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,970
'ONCE UPON A PRINCE' HAS ENTERED THE CHAT

86
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,097
SWEET POTATO: BITCH MUST LOOK LIKE AN ORC

87
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,683
Are we talking
about my face again?

88
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,310
You really wanna see my face, everyone?

89
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,606
TRUE BEAUTY IS INNER BEAUTY.

90
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,316
LET'S NOT JUDGE PEOPLE BY THEIR LOOKS.

91
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,318
I'm totally with Prince here.

92
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,404
You just talk about how someone looks.

93
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,947
Gosh, aren't you tired of it?

94
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,032
You're right, Mo-mi. You know,

95
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,287
I think those who are less attractive,
are actually more interesting

96
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,621
and mature on the inside.

97
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,416
Those pretty and handsome idiots
never had...

98
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,711
...to experience
any type of rejection.

99
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,297
I agree.

100
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,924
People who are only concerned
with looks are bad.

101
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:56,220
Hmm, Prince,
what you're saying is really deep.

102
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,264
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

103
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,808
All right, enough about looks.

104
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,810
Do you wanna listen to some music?

105
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,314
Hmm, I'm not sure
if the younger generation

106
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,024
is familiar with this song.

107
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,817
It's my all-time favorite.

108
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,153
"Dance In The Rhythm" by Wan-sun Kim.

109
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,780
I sincerely hope
you enjoy it as much as I do.

110
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,585
You are very beautiful,
even without the mask, Mo-mi.

111
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,006
I love you, Mo-mi.

112
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,677
I love you too, Oh-nam.

113
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,525
Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk,
milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk,

114
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,987
milk, milk, milk, milk, milk,
milk, milk, milk, milk, milk.

115
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:37,905
MILK

116
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,699
- Yes!
- Oh no!

117
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,493
I wore something pretty today.
What do I do?

118
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,995
Okay, here I go!

119
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,250
Ooh!

120
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,464
It's not breaking
as well as I thought.

121
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,842
It must be because the ice is slippery.

122
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,063
All right, let's all have a drink.

123
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,065
Cheers!

124
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,317
Have a drink, everyone.

125
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,909
Cheers.

126
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,419
I think I like this wine too.

127
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,297
French wine is just our type of thing,
isn't that right?

128
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,300
Jeez. I feel like I'm already drunk.

129
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,326
Uh-oh!

130
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,327
Sorry?

131
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,621
Hi.

132
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,880
That's not what I'm saying.

133
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,467
What I'm saying is that telling a woman
to pour you a glass is wrong.

134
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,760
It doesn't matter if...

135
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,722
Actually, Mr. Park doesn't like
when female employees pour him drinks.

136
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,098
Oh.

137
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,392
...same thing
as a woman touching a man's chest?

138
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,812
- Okay. Whoa, whoa!
- I'm just saying.

139
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,939
Uh-huh. That's enough, you two. Hmm?

140
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,734
- By the way, Mr. Park.
- Why did you put them so far away?

141
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,279
The kids these days,
they're on an entirely different level.

142
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,324
If they do this,
people donate Heart Pangs left and right.

143
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,703
Ooh, it gets really crazy.
If you give 1,000, that's 100,000,

144
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,039
and if you give 10,000,
it's a million won.

145
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,501
Many young people nowadays
are trying to make money in this manner.

146
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,836
Ahh!

147
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,713
Young people
are just outta their minds these days.

148
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,591
Check this out.
The hottest one on this site is her.

149
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,969
Let's see. Here. Her.
She's called Mask Girl.

150
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,806
Uh-oh.

151
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,599
- I'm sorry.
- All good.

152
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,477
I moved to Osan Pass, you know?

153
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,314
Oh, you did?
Then, sure, get in.

154
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,904
Right, Ms. A-reum.
Let's go for another round.

155
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,568
What should we eat
with our second round of drinks...

156
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,076
- Mr. Kim, I...
- Oh! You scared me, damn it.

157
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,912
How long have you been standing here? Huh?

158
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,374
You should've said something
if you were right here. My God, what?!

159
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:40,212
- I... I just... Uh, I have something...
- Yeah, sure, go, bye.

160
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,506
- Let's get spicy chicken feet!
- Sounds good!

161
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,716
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

162
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,593
Let's go. Hell yeah!

163
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,970
What about you? Any other plans?

164
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,611
No, no.
It was totally coincidental.

165
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,196
My place is on the way to his, that's why.

166
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,783
Anyway. On the way,
his wife called him, right?

167
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,620
But even though
he was in the taxi with me,

168
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,749
he lied to his wife,
saying that he was alone.

169
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,709
Why do you think he did that?

170
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,152
HE COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO EXPLAIN

171
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,503
Exactly. That's all it is.

172
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,505
He could've just said
that he was in a taxi

173
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,509
with an employee
'cause her place was on the way.

174
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,134
BRAD PIT: YOU'RE SO DELUSIONAL

175
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,677
Yeah. Go, Brad Pit.

176
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,864
'BRAD PIT' HAS BEEN KICKED FROM THE CHAT

177
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,683
Then, how about this?
A while back, I told him like,

178
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,727
"Oh, your perfume smells really nice."

179
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,645
No.

180
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,857
Then, guess what? He started wearing
only that perfume, nothing else.

181
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:47,321
But as I'm sure you already know,
I have absolutely no feelings for him.

182
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,532
ONCE UPON A PRINCE:
IF YOU DATE THAT MAN, I'LL KILL MYSELF.

183
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,310
HOW TO CONFESS YOUR LOVE SUCCESSFULLY

184
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,022
I'm in love with you, Momi.

185
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,238
Man, this isn't how
you're supposed to do it!

186
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,824
Mo-mi...

187
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,995
someone like him isn't healthy for you.
Just come to me, and...

188
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,146
I'll get going now.

189
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,749
What are you doing here, Oh-nam?

190
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,793
Oh, uh...

191
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,795
I...

192
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,007
Why are you standing here
and not going home?

193
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,092
- Oh...
- Huh?

194
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:33,927
Mmm...

195
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,764
Forget it! See you tomorrow!
Weird as fuck.

196
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,556
Yes, sir.

197
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,162
Oh!

198
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,014
Oh my God.

199
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,596
Everyone!

200
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,556
Everyone.

201
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,101
I think I've had
too much to drink.

202
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,898
Do you know what love is?

203
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,858
Oh, dear.

204
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,527
- Uh?! Love always hurts.
- Why is this not working?

205
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,738
I know how you feel. Trust me, I know.

206
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,489
Love is something...

207
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,991
Forget that piece of trash.

208
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,743
Feel real love with me now.

209
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,954
Ooh!

210
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,295
Huh? What? What is she doing?

211
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,174
Get it together, Mo-mi. Stop, stop, stop!

212
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,257
No!

213
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,345
- Shit, no!
- I love it!

214
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,906
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY:
YOU'LL GET SUSPENDED

215
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,766
- This is all because...
- Are you all watching?

216
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,893
...of that son of a bitch, Park.

217
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,353
No!

218
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,862
Excuse me, Mo-mi.

219
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,823
I have something to say.

220
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,575
Pardon?

221
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,829
- You should forget it.
- Uh, forget what?

222
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,082
You should forget about that

223
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,584
trash of a married fucking bastard!

224
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,878
Wh... What's gotten into you this morning?

225
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,547
I've been watching you all this time.

226
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,550
- What? What do you mean, "watching me"?
- Just...

227
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,844
Not really watching you...

228
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,226
I'm in love with you, Mo-mi!

229
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,312
I love you!

230
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,991
What's wrong with him
all of a sudden?

231
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,585
Why are you
only telling me this now?

232
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,963
What?

233
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,340
'Cause, actually...

234
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,094
I'm in love with you too, Mr. Ju.

235
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,347
You really love me?

236
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,173
Hey. Are you sick? Something wrong?

237
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,967
Oh, uh...

238
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,596
It's my wisdom tooth.

239
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,754
Uh, sorry, uh...

240
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,797
Yes?

241
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,764
N... No, it's nothing.

242
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,954
So, did you have something
you wanted to say to me?

243
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,539
Oh, that...

244
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,709
Oh, it's nothing.

245
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,504
Th... There was just a slight error
in the sales figures

246
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,464
in the data reported to Mr. Park, so...

247
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,299
Are you serious? I'm sorry.

248
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,510
It's fine. I adjusted it. He won't notice.

249
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:53,557
I appreciate it.
Um, see you tomorrow.

250
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,612
No taxi.

251
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,948
I might as well die.

252
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,918
Wait. Wait!

253
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,174
Wait, no, no, no!
Wait, hold on, hold on!

254
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,676
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

255
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,308
Sir, please, follow the cab
in front of you. Hurry up!

256
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,436
Quickly! Quickly!

257
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:49,988
MOTEL

258
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,626
UNKNOWN / I YOU

259
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,253
SEND

260
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,589
What? What's going on?

261
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,633
It's nothing.

262
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,615
Hi, Mom.

263
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,368
Why the hell
do you always pick up so late?

264
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,621
Anyway, I made some side dishes.
When should I drop by?

265
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,749
You don't have to
bring me food, thank you.

266
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,002
I haven't had time to eat at home lately.

267
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,045
What kind of stinking company is that?

268
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,382
They work you to the bone
and pay you an ant's ass worth of money.

269
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,386
Mom, I have to go.
My meeting's starting now.

270
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,346
I'll call you back.

271
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,930
Bye.

272
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,782
MASK GIRL HAS REQUESTED A 1:1 CHAT

273
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,244
ACCEPT

274
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,789
MASK GIRL:
HI?

275
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,919
HEY! IT'S BEEN TOO LONG

276
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,339
I'M SO SAD THAT YOU GOT SUSPENDED.

277
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,343
I THINK I MIGHT AS WELL
QUIT LIVE STREAMING NOW

278
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,763
WHY? NO!

279
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,642
I don't think
I'm a woman who can be loved.

280
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,769
What do you mean?

281
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,687
You're so charming.

282
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:32,317
Cheer up, Mo-mi!
Be optimistic. I'm here for you.

283
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,736
You'll think differently

284
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,655
once you see my face.

285
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,991
No, don't say that.

286
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,493
I'm not like them.

287
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,707
I can assure you
that I would be good to you, cutie.

288
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,043
DO YOU WANT TO MEET UP?

289
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,126
What?! Oh...

290
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,005
IF I'M ALONE, I MIGHT DIE..

291
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,924
YOU'RE MY FRIEND

292
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,639
WHY SAY THAT?

293
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,185
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

294
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,441
WHY SAY THAT?
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

295
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,572
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

296
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,287
HANDSOME MONK'S GONNA BUY ME A DRINK

297
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,914
SORRY FOR SPOUTING NONSENSE

298
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,041
MASK GIRL HAS LOGGED OUT

299
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,893
Gosh, I must be out of my mind.

300
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,647
Damn it.

301
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,816
Whatever happens, happens, I guess.

302
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,154
Hey, Mask Girl!

303
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,364
Oh, you're Mask Girl, right?

304
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,618
Ah, I am so glad to meet you.
I, uh, I'm Handsome Monk.

305
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,455
Wow. I'm so honored.

306
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:15,712
Your streams are really the best,
Mask Girl. I think they're really amazing.

307
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,382
The other girl creators know,
uh, that they're pretty.

308
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,427
They don't have a...
a professional mindset, whatsoever.

309
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,805
Um, your streams, Mask Girl,
they're honest and open.

310
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,057
That's what's really awesome, you know?

311
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,060
- It's cool!
- Oh, sure. Thanks.

312
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,273
Uh... Um...

313
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,319
How 'bout, uh, we, uh,
speak more casually now?

314
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:40,987
We're 27.

315
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,990
Oh. Sure, why not.

316
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,743
Then can you take off your mask now?

317
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,163
Oh. I, uh, I'm not hungry.

318
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,624
Come on, I can't eat
all of this all by myself.

319
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,250
Take it off.

320
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,920
Take it... I'm gonna say it really loud.

321
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,463
- Take it off!
- Okay!

322
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,048
- Take it off!
- Stop.

323
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,633
- Take it off!
- Stop it!

324
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:15,146
- Don't look at me. I'm embarrassed.
- Wait, hold on.

325
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,485
So why have you been wearing a mask?

326
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:21,903
You're pretty.

327
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,030
What are you saying?

328
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,450
- You're making fun of me, aren't you?
- No, I'm not!

329
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,830
You're, um, really natural and, uh,

330
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,582
damn it, what's the word, um,

331
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,251
attractive.

332
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,002
Um, charming, you mean?

333
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,796
Charming, that's it!

334
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,799
But you're also totally attractive.

335
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,635
And so,
did you spend time in America?

336
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,888
- Hmm?
- Seems you lived in America for a while.

337
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,015
Uh, until I graduated college.

338
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,810
My family, are in the US.

339
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,687
I live in Korea.

340
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,522
Aren't you a bit lonely?

341
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,233
Um, I was a bit lonely.

342
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,194
When I came to Korea,
I was completely lost.

343
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,113
Okay, so, I cried.

344
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,990
I was alone.

345
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,284
Oh, I know what it's like.

346
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,704
Um...
well, I think it's better now.

347
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,459
Mask Girl, if you go to America,
you'll be really popular.

348
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:19,919
Yeah?

349
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:24,549
Yeah! American guys, uh, appreciate girls,

350
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,175
um, with, uh...

351
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,176
Cheekbones?

352
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,679
Yeah. They really like girls
with high cheekbones.

353
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,762
Oh.

354
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,139
Really?

355
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,228
I... I was thinking
about getting surgery, though.

356
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,147
Ah, please don't.

357
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,692
Mask Girl,
you're really, really attractive.

358
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,193
If you ask me...

359
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,030
No, I'm really against it.

360
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,374
Let's go.

361
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,609
Hey, I apologize
for taking so long.

362
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,819
Oh, no problem. It's fine.

363
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,490
- One more drink?
- Okay.

364
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,991
Do you want something else?

365
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:36,287
- Um, I'll have the same one as you.
- Okay.

366
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,163
Excuse me!

367
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,041
MASK GIRL

368
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,459
HANDSOME MONK

369
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,045
I MET MASK GIRL
AT THE FOOD ALLEY IN CHEONG-DONG

370
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,588
HANDSOME MONK
27 YEARS OLD, MALE

371
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,215
I'LL POST PICTURES
SHE'S FUCKING UGLY

372
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,967
WAIT UP GUYS
I'M GETTING HER DRUNK

373
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,511
SHE'S EVEN UGLIER THAN I THOUGHT

374
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:55,640
BUT STILL, I HAVE TO HAVE A TASTE

375
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,643
This bastard!

376
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,736
A whole lot really.

377
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,406
Oh my God!
You're so funny!

378
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,246
You know what?
It's really loud in here, right?

379
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:22,500
- Do you wanna go somewhere quiet?
- Sure, yeah. Do you know where?

380
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,586
- Mmm, let's go outside and look.
- Sounds good.

381
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,295
Okay.

382
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,090
Let's go!

383
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,431
Uh... Uh... to...
to Cheong-dong Food Alley, please.

384
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:48,317
I swear, I thought
Grandma's, um, uh, Bone Hangover Soup,

385
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,154
uh, actually had grandma's bones in it.

386
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,240
- Really?
- Yeah, so I was super scared.

387
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,454
Oh.Well,
should we just get some beers and, uh,

388
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,788
enjoy a quiet drink here?

389
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,248
Uh...

390
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,084
Here?

391
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,628
Mm-hmm. Yeah, let's watch a movie
and have a beer.

392
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,589
It's just...

393
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,882
this is a little too...

394
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,509
Oh, the other places are so noisy.

395
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,138
Come on! Let's go!

396
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,269
I need a room. For a few hours.

397
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,149
- We don't rent rooms by the hour.
- The ones in Bongcheon-dong did.

398
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,444
- Great. We don't do that here.
- Um...

399
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,073
- How much is it for the night?
- Sixty thousand won.

400
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,043
There you go.

401
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,423
All right, Mask Girl,

402
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,093
um, I'll go buy some beers, okay?

403
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,761
You can wait in the room. Here.

404
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,355
Oh, I spent so much fucking money,
I'm so bummed out.

405
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,272
Fuck!

406
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,025
Man, she could've offered
to buy the beers. Shit.

407
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,239
So fucking annoying.

408
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,467
ASSOCIATE MANAGER JU OH-NAM
EIGHT MISSED CALLS

409
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,622
MO-MI, WHERE ARE YOU?
PLEASE CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS

410
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,047
What's up with him?

411
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,139
You know, um, I don't...

412
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,391
I don't think
we should drink here, though.

413
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,726
Is it even allowed?

414
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,396
You said it was fine. What's wrong? Hmm?

415
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,399
- What's going on all of a sudden?
- Hold on.

416
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,152
I just think it's weird

417
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,903
to be here.

418
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,035
Mask Girl. Come here.
Just come here, sit for a moment.

419
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,830
Whoa, what? Hey, this is a water bed!
Wow, I've never seen this before.

420
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,169
Mask Girl, look!
Just sit down for a moment, hmm?

421
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,676
Okay. Let's cozy up, what do you say?

422
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,804
We could just drink beer here and, uh,

423
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,016
watch a show and have a chat. Casually.

424
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,101
I still don't...

425
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,061
um...

426
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,942
You're so beautiful.

427
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,778
Stop it! No!

428
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,032
Wait. Are you making me
the bad guy here, huh?

429
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,038
We had a really good time, remember? Hmm.

430
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,920
I'm outta here!

431
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,757
If you weren't gonna do it,
you should've told me earlier.

432
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,342
What a fucking waste of money!

433
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,556
I'll refund it.

434
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,434
What?

435
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,481
What are you doing playing hard to get
when you're that fucking ugly?

436
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,990
What did you

437
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,783
just say to me?

438
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,536
When you're that fucking ugly,
why are you playing hard to get?

439
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,289
You practically showed everything
on your live streams.

440
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,541
So what's with this arrogant bullshit?

441
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,837
If you were attractive, I'd let it go,
you know? But you're fucking ugly.

442
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,964
Fucking bullshit.

443
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,219
Shit, are you fucking crazy?

444
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,473
You're fucking pissing me off,
you fucking bitch!

445
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,102
Let go, you fucking bastard!

446
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,736
You!

447
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,280
- Come here, you filthy bitch!
- Let go, you son of a bitch!

448
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,197
Argh!

449
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,782
- Ah! Fuck!
- Hey, wait a second!

450
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,992
You fucking bastard!

451
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,287
- Wait!
- Die! You fucking bastard!

452
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,415
You fucking lied
about coming from America, didn't you?

453
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,833
You son of a bitch!

454
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,877
- Fucking die, you son of a bitch!
- Hey! Stop!

455
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,629
Die, you son of a bitch.

456
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,343
Argh! Let go!

457
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,891
For fuck's sake.

458
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,311
- Fuck you.
- You psychotic bitch.

459
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,480
You bastard.

460
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,316
Die!

461
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,964
Oh shi...

462
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,627
Ambulance.

463
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,128
Ambulance.

464
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,267
GET OUT OF THERE!

465
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,937
HE'S GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU!

ASSOCIATE MANAGER JU OH-NAM

467
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,042
Hello? Hello?!

468
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,043
Mo-mi!

469
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,885
Mo-mi?

470
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,470
Are you all right?

471
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,404
Ugh.

472
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,907
Hmm...

473
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,664
Is...

474
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,957
Is he dead?

475
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,463
I don't know, I...

476
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,095
Uh, this bastard tried to jump me
and force himself on me, so...

477
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,307
I said no, I didn't want to,
but he... didn't...

478
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,058
Kept pushing.

479
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,202
I should report it.
Call the police, right?

480
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,838
If you report it like this,
you might go to jail.

481
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,634
If I say that it was self-defense,
they will understand.

482
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,719
They might...

483
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,223
Wouldn't it work out?

484
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,561
You came to the motel with this bastard
of your own free will, though.

485
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,232
Even if it turns out
to be manslaughter,

486
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,735
you'll have to serve
at least a few years in prison.

487
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,204
Then, what do I do, huh?

488
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,731
You should go home, Mo-mi.
I'll take care of this here.

489
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,826
- Wh... What do you mean?
- I can take care of it.

490
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,954
You need... to go now.

491
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,040
No, I can't just leave.

492
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,168
- How can I...
- Yes, you can. I'm begging you.

493
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,628
Please go home now.

494
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,880
I don't think that's right.

495
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,841
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please!

496
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,515
Please leave. Just go.

497
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,459
Ms. Sang-sun.
What happened to Ms. Mo-mi? Huh?

498
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,044
- Mo-mi?
- Yeah.

499
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,546
- I'm not sure.
- My goodness.

500
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,382
No, because earlier this morning,

501
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,676
I got a message from HR
letting me know she'd called.

502
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,678
Apparently, she said she's quitting.

503
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,596
What?

504
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,266
I mean, it's incredible.
You just quit by phone these days? Huh?

505
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,517
Can't believe this.

506
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,355
Back in my day,
this was simply unthinkable. Right?

507
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,900
The person you are calling
is currently unavailable. Please leave a...

508
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,736
She's even turned off her phone.
What's goin' on?

509
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,280
...they're on
an entirely different level.

510
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,157
MISSING PERSON CASES

511
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,575
90-YEAR-OLD WITH DEMENTIA MISSING

512
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,035
YONGHAK SISTERS MISSING

513
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,287
LOOKING FOR A MISSING CHILD

514
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,126
MASK GIRL

515
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,047
STREAMER SUSPENDED DUE TO VIOLATION
OF RULES AND CONDUCT DURING LIVE STREAM

516
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,968
Um...

517
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:37,349
could I get Ms. Mo-mi Kim's home address?
She's from Sales Management.

518
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,267
For what reason?

519
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,351
It's just

520
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,981
that Ms. Mo-mi quit today,
and I think she's

521
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,608
not picking up her phone.

522
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,322
We have to send her stuff to her,
but I don't know her address.

523
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,740
Oh, sure. Hold on, please.

524
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,188
The person you are calling
is currently unavailable.

525
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,065
Please leave a me...

526
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,429
It's been a while, everyone.

527
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,973
Today's my last live stream.

528
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,934
Thank you for everything.

529
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,659
SOMETHING'S OFF ABOUT HER AGAIN
IS SHE DRUNK?

530
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,679
Mo-mi, open the door, please.
I know you're inside.

531
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,765
Come on, open the door right now, Mo-mi!

532
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,236
Come in.

533
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,315
So are you going somewhere?

534
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,737
Why did you leave the company?

535
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,616
I can't go back to work.

536
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,121
Acting like nothing happened
that night in that motel.

537
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,373
Mo-mi, please...

538
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,835
You have to forget
about what happened.

539
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,796
Just disregard it as if it never happened.

540
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,841
You and I both know he deserved to die.

541
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,592
He was

542
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,012
nothing more than just a cockroach.

543
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,099
You're him, aren't you?

544
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,521
Once Upon A Prince.

545
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,237
I thought it was strange...

546
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,825
how you knew that I was meeting with him.

547
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,496
Once I gathered my thoughts,
it became clear.

548
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,958
It's you, isn't it?

549
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,796
You're also the one
who sent me that strange email.

550
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,592
Why did you do that?

551
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,012
Why did you do it?

552
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,349
I didn't do it on purpose.

553
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:52,479
When I saw you go into a motel with Park,
a burst of anger came over me.

554
00:53:56,483 --> 00:54:00,070
It was the first time I had feelings
like this towards another person.

555
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm sorry.

556
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,177
You're right.

557
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,056
You're right, Mr. Oh-nam.

558
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,016
I'm going to...

559
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,312
erase what happened from my memory.

560
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:38,983
Like you said,

561
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,280
I'm just going to believe
that a cockroach died.

562
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,865
I'm gonna start over.

563
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,535
Now the Mo-mi Kim of the past

564
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,035
is dead.

565
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,915
I'm gonna start anew.

566
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,041
Completely

567
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:57,876
fresh.

568
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,756
What about me, then?

569
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,598
Are you gonna erase me too, huh?

570
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,273
Mr. Oh-nam...

571
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,695
what do you want me to do for you?

572
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,448
Hmm?

573
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,374
You're the same.

574
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,550
Stop!

575
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,432
Let go! Damn it!

576
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,711
I have to protect you, Mo-mi, okay?

577
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,005
That day, I made the decision

578
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,631
to, uh...

579
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,760
...always protect you from now on.

580
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,306
I love you, Mo-mi!

581
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,007
What the hell did you do?

582
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,563
Son of a bitch.
