1
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,428
MASK GIRL

2
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,516
MO-MI KIM

3
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,437
Next person, come in.

4
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,732
Open your mouth.

5
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,198
Next person. Come in.

6
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,759
Open your mouth.

7
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,639
Tilt your head up.

8
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,142
Lift your tongue.

9
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,817
Turn around, spread your legs,
and bend down.

10
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,573
Bend down.

11
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:16,422
PEACE AND HARMONY

12
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,557
Mm-hm. She won't make it
through the night.

13
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,167
Whoa!

14
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,421
Jesus fucking Christ.

15
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,965
You were on TV, weren't you?
You're Mask Girl!

16
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,509
You look way better in person.

17
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,848
I swear the plastic surgery
isn't super noticeable.

18
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,309
Everyone said you were
a plastic surgery addict,

19
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,060
but you don't look it at all.

20
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,937
And so, how much did it cost?

21
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,106
Hmm?

22
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,693
Thirty million won.

23
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,486
Thirty million?!

24
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,322
It cost her 30 million won!

25
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,828
Eyes and nose are a given.

26
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,746
Cheekbones?

27
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,331
Forehead.

28
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,834
Did you get your jaw contoured?

29
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,047
Wow. Anywhere else?
Did you get a boob job too?

30
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,508
These are just
my original breasts.

31
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,719
Except for her boobs,
she got everything done!

32
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,723
Except for her boobs.

33
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,601
Honestly, though.

34
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,395
I wanna try plastic surgery
to see if I can become prettier.

35
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,899
She had work done?
Wow! Looks so natural. Hmm.

36
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,735
You should get a neck lift
for your sagging skin, old-timer.

37
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,197
And if you get your under-eye fat removed,
you'll look much younger.

38
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,951
A minor nose job
might also be useful, I think.

39
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,912
You're basically saying
get a new face.

40
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:17,251
What a true professional! If you know
a doctor that does a good job, hook me up.

41
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,545
So when I get out,
I can get everything done.

42
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,964
Get everything done and what?
Milk another man dry?

43
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,134
You're trying to
sink your teeth into a rich man's neck

44
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,719
and live the easy life, right?

45
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,637
Ha!

46
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,099
- You bitches are a shitshow.
- You're all insane.

47
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,060
Think I wanna get a nose job.

48
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,562
Oh my. It's cold.
Let's go. C'mon.

49
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,980
Let's go, c'mon.

50
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:40,982
Move!

51
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,947
Girl, don't stare, don't stare.

52
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,370
Who the hell is that woman?

53
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,997
That's An Eun-suk.

54
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,291
"An Eun-suk"?

55
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,212
That woman's the queen here.

56
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,297
She even has authority over the warden.

57
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,718
She's connected to politicians,
conglomerate owners, you name it.

58
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,781
You may get released and land a top
position if you manage to win her favor.

59
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,683
- That much, huh?
- Yeah. Look away. Don't be stupid.

60
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,272
She gets skincare here
whenever she feels like it

61
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,190
and even calls in shamans to do rituals.
Oof, it's cold.

62
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,068
And how did that woman end up here anyway?

63
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,282
For aiding and abetting murder.

64
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,827
She hired someone to chop up
her husband and his mistress into pieces.

65
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,037
Isn't it insane?

66
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,165
Oh right. You did it too.

67
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,335
Hey, Eun-suk is calling you.

68
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,608
Have your legs

69
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,486
been injured?

70
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,196
What?

71
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,822
You dragged your feet.

72
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,292
So you're Mask Girl, correct?

73
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,126
Yes.

74
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,180
You look way too similar.

75
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,851
You look way too similar
to the bitch who seduced my husband, so...

76
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,731
stay the hell out of my sight
if you understand what I mean.

77
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,359
Or else I'll kill you myself.

78
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,803
Please.

79
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,984
Why isn't she feeding her?

80
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,695
She's in here for adultery.

81
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,492
Eun-suk made a rule that adulteresses
must starve for three days.

82
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,301
- Hey. What are you doing?
- She must be hungry.

83
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,346
You're putting
yourself in danger.

84
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,853
It's okay.

85
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,900
It's not okay!

86
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,153
Enjoy your lunch.

87
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,335
Fuckin...

88
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,129
What are you looking at?

89
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,423
Hey.

90
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,009
Hey, you!

91
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,846
Oh, this... this fucking bitch.

92
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,183
Do you want me to put you in the washer
and clean you too?

93
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,776
Don't act out,
and mind your own business

94
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,569
if you don't wanna die.

95
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,282
What?

96
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,079
Want me to make your face
all crooked again? Huh?

97
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,712
What's wrong?

98
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,173
What ya staring at?

99
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,758
An ugly woman.

100
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,011
Fucking bitch.

101
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,222
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey!

102
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,142
- Do something!
- Let go, bitch! Stop!

103
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,727
Let go! Let go!

104
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,687
- Hey!
- Let go of me!

105
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,397
- She's crazy!
- Fuck!

106
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,941
- Shit!
- Tramp!

107
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,360
Hey!

108
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,571
- Let go!
- Hey!

109
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,782
Let go!
Get off of me! Let go! Let go!

110
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,866
Stop!

111
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,687
- Why am I the only one being locked up?
- Because you hit her first.

112
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,899
They picked a fight with me first.

113
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,318
Listen,

114
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,987
you can't mess with Eun-suk's gang.

115
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,707
Number 1047.
Your punishment is over.

116
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,096
Mask Girl.

117
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,726
I told you you were putting yourself
in danger. Don't stir shit.

118
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,104
The best thing to do in this hellhole
is stay quiet as a mouse,

119
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,942
then get parole for good behavior
and get out while you're young.

120
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,112
A nail that sticks out
is bound to get hammered in.

121
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,033
Anyway...

122
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,669
Leave her alone, you crazy slut!

123
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,797
Stop it, you bitch!
Are you crazy?

124
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,466
- Grab her! Grab her!
- You bitch!

125
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,137
Crazy bitch, stop it!
Leave her the fuck alone!

126
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,221
Stop it, bitch!

127
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,685
I'm gonna kill you,
you fuckin' slut!

128
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,150
Number 1047,
you are sentenced to 15 days in solitary.

129
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,204
Get me help!

130
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,750
Leave her alone!

131
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,999
Bitch! Leave her alone!

132
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,794
You fucker! Guys, come help us!

133
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,298
Help me! Please help... Help me!

134
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,508
Pull her hair! Somebody stop her!

135
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,678
- Help me!
- Get off of her! You're crazy!

136
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,157
EDIFICATION ACCORDING TO LAW AND PRINCIPLE
HUISEONG PENITENTIARY

137
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,517
I'm so exhausted.
All thanks to that Mo-mi Kim.

138
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,522
Can't you have her
locked up in solitary confinement forever?

139
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,443
We already locked her up
far longer than what the rules stipulate.

140
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,112
They're going to run an inspection soon.

141
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,907
I hope things don't get too wild.

142
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,495
If the inspector catches wind of this,
you could also get roped into it.

143
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,416
Well, anyway,
isn't my face too wrinkly now? Mmm?

144
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,626
Let me have a look.

145
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,670
Closer.

146
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,006
Oh, you're right.

147
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,634
You do need a couple filler injections.

148
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,177
Filler?

149
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,805
One shot and your skin
will be smooth like that.

150
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,931
I can hook you up.

151
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,975
That'd be perfect. Thanks!

152
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,730
Number 1047,
your punishment is over.

153
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,494
- I'm full.
- Me too. I ate too much.

154
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,121
That's exactly what I'm saying.

155
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,164
I need to go on a diet,
I'm really struggling.

156
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,126
- Are you serious?
- Bullshit. You look fantastic.

157
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,169
Fuck. That psycho bitch is here again.

158
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,007
- Why is that bitch already out?
- Yeah, why? Shit.

159
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,805
- Hmm.
- Where are you going? Hey!

160
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,517
Damn it.

161
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,820
Hey! What are you doing?

162
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,698
Oh my God!

163
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,535
I can't run any faster!

164
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,331
- Oh! I'm sorry!
- Help me. Help me! Help me!

165
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,043
Okay, okay. W... Wait a second.

166
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,296
I'm sorry, don't hit me!
Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.

167
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,048
Stop it!

168
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,223
How about we leave each other alone.

169
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,892
Truce, no fighting.

170
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,393
Okay?

171
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,606
Say it's okay! Yes?

172
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,329
- Oh my God!
- Let me help you! Are you okay?

173
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,748
Fine. Shit.
Did she hurt you?

174
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,006
Bitch is crazier than I thought.

175
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,955
Notifying all inmates.

176
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,666
A meeting between the inmates
and the new warden

177
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,501
will be held at the auditorium.

178
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,921
All inmates, please come
to the auditorium.

179
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,468
Face left.

180
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,055
Move forward.

181
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,693
I don't care...

182
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,819
A FRESH START WITH LOVE

183
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,613
...about the crimes you have committed.

184
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,699
It's simple.

185
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,451
In front of God, we are all sinners.

186
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,496
My first duty is to help you

187
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,457
in sincerely repenting
and beginning a new life.

188
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,334
That's what I really want for you.

189
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,961
My dear ladies,

190
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,090
free yourself from your mind's prison
and look for salvation.

191
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,092
Then, this place

192
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,844
will feel like heaven.

193
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,388
Do you understand?

194
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,140
No!

195
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,728
From now on,
we don't answer with a "yes, ma'am."

196
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,982
We always say, um,
"I love you," you got it?

197
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,069
Repeat after me.

198
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,572
I love you!

199
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,240
I love you.

200
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,950
Very good. Louder!

201
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,703
I love you.

202
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,455
Very nice. Once more!

203
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,998
- I love you.
- Very good.

204
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,666
Look at the person next to you.

205
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,377
Look them in the eyes and tell them.
What do you say?

206
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,714
She's acting like a cult leader,
not a prison warden, don't you think?

207
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,217
- Shout it together! Everyone!
- What is she doing?

208
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,385
I love you! Everyone!

209
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,304
I love you.

210
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,430
I love you.

211
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:27,476
- She's new. Just came in today.
- Ah, so, uh, you came in today?

212
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,270
Number 2058. You're so young.

213
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,980
Uh, how did you end up here?

214
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,150
I severed the dick of an asshole.

215
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,361
Ah...

216
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,620
Do you know
that a person's body was created by God?

217
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:52,042
And therefore, we should definitely not
intentionally destroy such creations.

218
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,710
Can I go?

219
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,255
Absolutely.

220
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,090
I love you.

221
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,054
- She's Mask Girl.
- Oh, Mask Girl, huh?

222
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,306
I heard a lot about you.

223
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,102
That you had been showing exemplary
conduct in the penitentiary.

224
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,439
To me, you know,

225
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,068
it doesn't matter what you did
when you were outside of those walls.

226
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,862
In my prison, everyone is treated equally.

227
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,572
Here, we are all God's children.

228
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,574
You know that, right?

229
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,704
Very good. I love you.

230
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,040
A FRESH START WITH LOVE
HUISEONG PENITENTIARY

231
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,212
I heard zen chai is your favorite,
so I made one.

232
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,132
Oh my goodness. You're the best.

233
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,510
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

234
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,349
I heard a lot about you
from the previous warden.

235
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,892
So you'll take care of me?

236
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,562
Oh no. Take good care of me.

237
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,648
Cheers!

238
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,734
Cheers.

239
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,738
Gosh.

240
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,781
The cherry blossoms are so pretty.

241
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,747
Excuse me.

242
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,375
Are you really Mask Girl?

243
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,837
Yeah. That's her.

244
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,090
Oh shit, that's fuckin' sick, man.

245
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,926
I never thought I'd meet Mask Girl here.

246
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,553
You know what?

247
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,015
You've always been my hero.

248
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,976
All of my friends
super look up to you, you know?

249
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
Look up to her?

250
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,607
All those scumbags
you chopped up into pieces.

251
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,693
I chickened out
and only cut a guy's dick off.

252
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,238
Wow, fuck.
I'm gonna fuckin' brag when I get out.

253
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,204
That girl from earlier,
doesn't she seem a little cuckoo?

254
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:58,085
These days, I feel like there are
more and more kids who are just nuts.

255
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Shit.

256
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,424
- Number 1047, you've got a letter.
- A letter?

257
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,134
Whoa!

258
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,764
Isn't this the first letter you got
since you got here? Who's it from?

259
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,225
It says "MG Love" on the envelope.

260
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,102
"MG Love"? Wow.

261
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,397
So it's not a legend. You really do
have fans outside, don't you?

262
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,640
FROM MG LOVE
TO MO-MI KIM 1047

263
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,984
So many years passed and
there's still someone thinking about you?

264
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,528
My God!

265
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:32,993
What is that?

266
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,581
That's not a letter.
It looks like some kinda news article.

267
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,671
"Is violence genetic"? What?

268
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,136
SOCIAL EDUCATION NECESSARY

269
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,012
TO SUPPRESS MANIFESTATION
OF GENETIC VIOLENCE

270
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,354
Hey, what is this?

271
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,776
"It's your turn to feel what it feels like
when your kid is broken, bitch"?

272
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,447
Huh, who the hell
sent something like this?

273
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,630
IS VIOLENCE GENETIC?

274
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,924
You're reading
that article again?

275
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,219
What does it change
if you keep looking at it?

276
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,929
It only torments you.

277
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,267
Anyway.

278
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,897
How come you never mentioned
you had a kid all this time? I'm hurt.

279
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,943
But how the hell
could they say that about a child?

280
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,904
It isn't her fault.

281
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,864
I can't believe it. God. Ugh.

282
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,490
Cellie...

283
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,991
Yeah?

284
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,119
What?

285
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,042
I need to get out.

286
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,792
What?!

287
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,921
You shittin' me?

288
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,924
Oh my goodness, you mean it!

289
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,424
Oh!

290
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,260
Do what you want!

291
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,306
Do you think getting out of here
is something you can just

292
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,432
do when you feel like it?

293
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,684
I didn't hear a thing.

294
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,768
Not a word!

295
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,684
Are you working on all of these at once?

296
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,812
Yeah.

297
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,148
It's easier for me to work that way.

298
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,529
This really slows you down, though.
Do one at a time.

299
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,366
Pick up your speed!

300
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,455
APRIL 13
2:14 P.M.

301
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,332
APRIL 13
2:50 P.M.

302
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,706
What is it?

303
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,459
I have to use the restroom.

304
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,336
Go ahead. Be quick.

305
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,223
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the restroom.

306
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,308
You may pass.

307
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,109
Go on.

308
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,856
What you're planting
right now are strawberries.

309
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,568
Because strawberries prefer cool climates,
they do well in the winter.

310
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,114
But in the central region of Korea,
if you don't cover them up well,

311
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,409
their leaves or flowers in full bloom
could be damaged by frost.

312
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,327
Yes. Uh, red lettuce there.

313
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,869
Green lettuce here.

314
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,381
- Ouch! Oh, something stung me!
- What's going on?

315
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,925
A bug. It's a bug, a bug!
Ah, gosh, where'd it go?

316
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,928
Goddammit! Ow! It's there...
It's there, uh!

317
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,390
Uh... We're running a bit low
on seedlings here.

318
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,183
They're in storage. Go bring some.

319
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,270
It's not here. It's gone.
Where did it sting you?

320
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,732
- Is it gone? Oh, it hurt a lot.
- Are you okay?

321
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,191
Ah, thought I would die.

322
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,918
Hey, stop! Get down right now!

323
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,253
Get down!

324
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,339
Get down! Get down right now!

325
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,474
I don't...

326
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,062
I was so good to them, no?

327
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,065
How could someone
try to break out of our prison?

328
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,984
It doesn't make sense at all.

329
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,996
What the hell did you do
in the control center?

330
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,827
I'm sorry, ma'am.

331
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,040
Lock Mask Girl up.

332
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,167
In solitary. For at least... a month.

333
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,047
Um, the maximum duration
for solitary is two weeks.

334
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,177
Ah, true!

335
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,472
Right, two weeks, two weeks. Two weeks!

336
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,184
Make up reasons to hold her
for as long as I say.

337
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,937
How about "causing a disturbance"
or "threatening officers"?

338
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,480
Are these sufficient reasons?

339
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,691
Do I...

340
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,193
need to explain everything?

341
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,154
No, ma'am. I apologize, ma'am.

342
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,282
Get out.

343
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,617
Get out!

344
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,469
Number 1047.

345
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,854
HOLY BIBLE

346
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,198
What is this?

347
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,076
It's the Holy Bible, obviously.

348
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,247
Why did you give me this?

349
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,876
According to the warden, you did what you
did 'cause you were tempted by the devil.

350
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,081
- You're dismissed.
- Ma'am.

351
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,751
I think you should see
prisoner number 1047

352
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,628
in solitary confinement.

353
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,797
Who's that?

354
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,715
Um, Mask Girl.

355
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,177
What about her?
Did she cause trouble again?

356
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,637
No. But, uh...

357
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,728
How long has she been in solitary again?

358
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,774
- A little over a month.
- One month?

359
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,110
- It's already been that long?
- Yep.

360
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,654
She's here.

361
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,259
What is she doing?

362
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,218
She's praying.

363
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,471
She does that all day.

364
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,438
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

365
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,316
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

366
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,445
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our tres...

367
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,657
Oh my goodness!

368
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,158
Are you okay?

369
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,120
Your lips have split, sweetheart.

370
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,872
Oh, those fuckin' assholes!

371
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:05,084
I mean, how could they
lock you up in solitary for over a month?

372
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,004
Isn't this illegal?
Should I just report them?

373
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,842
It's okay, my friend.

374
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,261
It was a meaningful time for me.

375
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,848
You seem kinda different.

376
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,018
Do I?

377
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,564
Uh... Well, um, I...

378
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,401
It's because I became a child of the Lord.

379
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,279
What? What are you talking about?

380
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,617
When I was in there,
the Lord spoke to me directly.

381
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,537
...that he will save me.

382
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,041
All of my life,

383
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,003
I always believed
I'd never be saved no matter what.

384
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,049
But the Lord appeared to me,

385
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:57,178
despite my wrongdoings
and all the sins I've committed.

386
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,389
After I began walking with the Lord...

387
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,350
everything

388
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,062
changed drastically for me.

389
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,145
Amen!

390
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,567
FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT
INMATE'S TESTIMONY OF FAITH

391
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,785
Dude...

392
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,373
You're pretending to believe
in Jesus, right?

393
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,976
To get on the good side of the warden?

394
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,002
Are you plotting
something again, by any chance?

395
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,089
Come on! If you are, take me with you.

396
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,514
Recreation time is over.

397
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,017
All inmates, please move quickly
to your respective cellblock.

398
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,020
I repeat...

399
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,730
But honestly,

400
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,900
I don't believe it either.

401
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,611
Are you for real?

402
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,162
- What's wrong with her?
- It's her daughter.

403
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,745
"Daughter"?

404
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,917
She needs a kidney transplant,
but she can't give her kidney to her.

405
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,548
I didn't think
she had a single tear in her.

406
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,427
But then again,
a child means everything to every parent.

407
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,641
Hey.

408
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,520
Get out of here.

409
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,275
Listen...

410
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,862
Get lost, or I swear to God

411
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,822
I'll strangle you.

412
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,867
What's your daughter's blood type?

413
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,286
If it's possible,

414
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,748
I would like to give
one of my kidneys to your daughter.

415
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,759
What?

416
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,345
Tell me what her blood type is.

417
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,932
AB.

418
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,019
Great. My blood type is AB too.

419
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,314
Is that true?

420
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,543
Mo-mi!

421
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,843
The third round of results is available.
We just received them.

422
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,388
You can give your kidney to my daughter!

423
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,639
- I really can?
- Yes!

424
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,849
It's a total miracle.

425
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,395
Thank you so much.
How can I ever repay you?

426
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,773
There's no need.
I'm so glad it all worked out.

427
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,027
Thank you! Thank you. So much.

428
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,534
Today, we'll be having a special
character development training session

429
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,035
with volunteers from outside.

430
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,455
All day long, they will be giving you
their undivided attention

431
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,793
and also have Bible study with you. If you
have any questions, feel free to ask.

432
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,421
Also, be sure to let out
all that's in your heart.

433
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,050
I committed a lot of crimes
and sins in my life.

434
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,016
You know, I was never, like, happy,
not even for a day.

435
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,561
But, for the past few weeks or so,

436
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,813
I've begun to, uh,

437
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,233
to really find peace in my heart.

438
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,737
I've asked for

439
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,990
forgiveness from the Lord, you see.

440
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,408
That's right.

441
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,910
And no matter what your sin is,

442
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,038
if you ask for it, you will be forgiven.

443
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,082
And God will save your soul.

444
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,460
I know you will also be absolved,

445
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,044
sister Mo-mi.

446
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,382
I'll pray for you.
It was nice meeting you.

447
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,842
Yes. Thank you.

448
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,429
We meet again.

449
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,108
It's me.

450
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,902
Oh-nam Ju's mom.

451
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,115
You got

452
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,743
my letter, right?

453
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,746
You didn't reply.

454
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,247
I was so sad.

455
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,126
I guess you weren't even curious

456
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,171
how I lived all this time.

457
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,088
I was basically

458
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,549
born again that day.

459
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,968
Father God

460
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,972
had given me another life to live!

461
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,893
So I could punish that devil of a bitch.

462
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,606
The police are investigating
a dismembered body

463
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:27,026
that was found in a compact vehicle
discovered at the bottom of the reservoir.

464
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,612
A local resident
discovered the compact vehicle

465
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,115
that had sunken into a reservoir
in Cheolhyeon-gun yesterday,

466
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,493
around 4 p.m.,
and reported it to the police.

467
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,329
The police are attempting
to identify the body

468
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,373
and track down the owner
of the discovered vehicle.

469
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:52,218
In order to find that bitch
away from the police's prying eyes,

470
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,678
I also had to change my face.

471
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,888
Just as she did.

472
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,579
Wow!

473
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,706
You are the woman who bought the gun.

474
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,377
You look totally different! Wow!

475
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,880
Oh!

476
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,552
IDENTIFICATION CARD
OH-JU NAM

477
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,472
- Appreciate your work.
- No problem.

478
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,644
I had to get
a new place to live as well.

479
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,983
No one lived here before.

480
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,193
They used this place as a factory,

481
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,487
making all sorts of paste
and salted seafood.

482
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,077
It's interesting, right?

483
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,789
So here, they stored salted seafood.

484
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,876
- You can check it out if you're curious.
- Yeah.

485
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,255
Okay.

486
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,425
I looked all over the country,

487
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,511
every nook and cranny, to find her.

488
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,721
But...

489
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,600
I couldn't find her anywhere.

490
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,938
Mask Girl,
the notorious serial killer,

491
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,481
has finally revealed herself.

492
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,151
Rumor has it she has become addicted
to plastic surgery.

493
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,820
She is now being escorted
into the police station.

494
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,865
MASK GIRL, SUSPECT OF SERIAL MURDERS,
TURNS HERSELF IN

495
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,284
Here. Please give us a comment.

496
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,249
Is this truly...

497
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,460
...your will?

498
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,257
Father.

499
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,262
- At first...
- Hi, Mi-mo!

500
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,265
...I believed that this
was the Lord's sole will

501
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,060
and decided to forget and move on.

502
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:06,977
Let's go.

503
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,980
- But no matter how much time passed...
- What did you do yesterday?

504
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,608
- ...I just couldn't do it.
- Not much. I just stayed home.

505
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,151
When I saw her face,

506
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,110
I saw

507
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,656
that bitch in her.

508
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,911
- Thank you very much.
- Sure. Bye-bye.

509
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,914
Kid. Kiddo!

510
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,540
Come over here.

511
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,793
It's fine, come over. Yes.

512
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,796
Here you go.

513
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,879
Come on.

514
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,422
Have some of this.

515
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,717
I don't have any money, though.

516
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,554
It's fine, don't worry!
It's Granny's treat. You can just eat.

517
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,559
My grandma said not to eat anything
people give to me for free.

518
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,645
Oh, she taught you well.

519
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,438
Bye now.

520
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,945
You must be hungry.

521
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,571
Here, eat up.

522
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,699
It's fine, it's fine. Eat up, eat up.

523
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,077
There.

524
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,380
Wow! I love it. It's so good.

525
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,131
Is that right?

526
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,051
Come on. Eat up now.
If you want more, I'll give you more.

527
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,095
Here. Have this with it as well.

528
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:27,891
KOREAN FAITH CHURCH

529
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,103
Huh? Good morning, Granny!

530
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,273
Oh my! It's you, Mi-mo!

531
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,650
Hi!

532
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,739
Grandma, this granny
is a tteokbokki truck owner.

533
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,283
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

534
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,494
Oh...
you go to this church, ma'am?

535
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,582
I moved to this neighborhood recently,
so I am attending this church.

536
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,168
- Oh.
- Oh, Ms. Shin. Good morning.

537
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,919
- Good morning.
- Hello, sweetie.

538
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,006
- Hello, ma'am.
- Okay, then. See you next week.

539
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,467
- Yes, see you.
- Bye-bye, Granny!

540
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,262
Come by again
and have some tteokbokki!

541
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,598
- I will!
- Okay.

542
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,726
When I saw that bitch's mom again,

543
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:14,271
my insides began to boil with rage.

544
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,566
Ladies, I'll give you a lot.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

545
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,859
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

546
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:24,490
There's a rumor,
but I don't know if it's true or not.

547
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,407
What is it?

548
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,533
Mask Girl's kid

549
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,286
actually goes to this school.

550
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,830
- "Mask Girl"?
- Yeah.

551
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:35,000
That girl who wore a mask and,
uh, became a murderer.

552
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,504
- She chopped up bodies and went to jail.
- I've heard about Mask Girl!

553
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,964
- She murdered, like, two people.
- Three.

554
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,591
- Three?
- Yeah.

555
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,718
That woman's daughter
goes to the school right now?

556
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,929
I heard she was in first grade.

557
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,222
She had, uh,

558
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,432
a strange name.

559
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,392
What was it, Kim...

560
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,769
Mi-mo?

561
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,647
- Mi-mo?
- Mi-mo?

562
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,982
- Isn't she in our kids' class?
- Oh no!

563
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,235
- Monster's daughter!
- Monster's daughter!

564
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,449
Granny.

565
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,533
What's wrong?

566
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,786
Why are you crying?

567
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,080
'Cause the other kids
are making fun of me.

568
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,003
Listen to me carefully.

569
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,965
From now on,
if someone is being mean to you,

570
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,051
punish them harshly, any way possible.

571
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,554
What? How can I do that?

572
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,765
You have to ensure
they can never do it again.

573
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:47,948
You're moving?
Oh dear, I'm so sad to see you go.

574
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,368
Don't cry. Granny will go see you often.

575
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,621
- Will you?
- Of course I will.

576
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,373
Just give me your new address.

577
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,792
You really have to come, okay?

578
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,085
Of course.

579
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,717
Oh yes.
Are you guys from the magazine?

580
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,428
Great. I wanted to tip you off.

581
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,596
It's about

582
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,933
Mask Girl's daughter.
Do you want to know more?

583
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,102
You!

584
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,397
Mi-mo's mom, do you know who she is?

585
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,066
Is that loser
from a rich family or something?

586
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,907
You don't know, do you?

587
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,116
What about her?

588
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:35,871
Forget it.

589
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:36,955
Are you kidding me?

590
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,540
Ah! Shit!

591
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,084
Come back here!

592
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,713
When I catch you,
you're dead!

593
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,011
Kiddo. Are you all right?

594
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,640
Don't you go
to that middle school right there?

595
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,934
Yeah, so what?

596
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,104
Does a kid named Mi-mo Kim
go there as well?

597
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:06,109
- How could you?!
- Wait! Why are you doing this?

598
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,611
Please!

599
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,488
You lied to me! You bitch!

600
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:13,200
Stop it! Listen to me.
I didn't spread any gossip about you...

601
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,993
Shut up, you backstabber!

602
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,083
My God! Mi-mo! What's going on?

603
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,584
Granny, please...

604
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:26,922
Come in, sweetheart. Quick! My goodness,
you came all the way here alone.

605
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,771
You little devil.

606
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,192
You need to feel
what I've felt all these years.

607
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,610
That heartbreak

608
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,321
when your baby disappears.

609
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,873
I'll keep you in my prayers.

610
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,173
Wait a minute.

611
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,051
- Oh my gosh!
- 1047, get away from her!

612
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,636
- Move!
- Do not move.

613
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,265
I can't let that woman leave!
Let go! She can't leave this...

614
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,142
She's mistaking me
for someone else.

615
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,144
She told me
she's going to kill someone!

616
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,021
- Oh my goodness.
- Don't let her go!

617
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,856
- Stay still!
- No, let go!

618
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,650
She's a killer.
If she leaves, she'll kill someone.

619
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,863
That woman is Oh-nam Ju's mother.
I can't let her leave!

620
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,657
- Let go of me, you don't understand!
- Stop moving!

621
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:39,453
You have to catch her! She's going to
kill someone! You can't let her go!

622
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,121
Stop her!

623
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,297
