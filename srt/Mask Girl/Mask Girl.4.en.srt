1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,513
I think

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,641
I know who this bitch is.

3
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:18,892
What'd you say?

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,732
You said this bitch's name
is Mo-mi Kim, didn't you?

5
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:07,794
MASK GIRL

6
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,133
CHUN-AE KIM

7
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,515
Why don't you introduce yourself?

8
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,727
I'm Chun-ae Kim.

9
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,521
Hmm? What?

10
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,898
Wh... What "ae Kim"?

11
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,526
Chun-ae Kim, sir.

12
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,614
Hey, hey! Quiet... Quiet down. And?

13
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,782
That's it?

14
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,618
Yes.

15
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,540
Sit in the empty seat there.
The second one from the back.

16
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,878
And by the way,
some of you were late again today.

17
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,130
Don't be late,
wear your uniforms properly,

18
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,549
and focus,
the tests are right around the corner.

19
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,759
And Min-jun, stop falling asleep in class.

20
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,178
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,387
Keep it down!

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,432
- Have a good day.
- You too!

23
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,940
Did you watch
Music Plaza yesterday?

24
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,651
Did you watch it yesterday?
My oppa got an award for it.

25
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,197
Oh my God, he was so cute.
I was dying, I swear!

26
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,743
Hey! Sechs Kies or H.O.T.?

27
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,244
Huh? What?

28
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,164
Do you like Sechs Kies or H.O.T.?

29
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,373
I like...

30
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,629
Sechs Kies.

31
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,590
- Sechs Kies?
- What the heck? Ugh! Damn.

32
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,467
Damn. You're lame.

33
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,719
So lame.
Let's go to the snack bar.

34
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,269
- Hello.
- Hello.

35
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,356
- Why's he always so good-looking?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,524
Get lost!

37
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,953
- Haven't seen you in a while.
- I know, it's been too long.

38
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,621
His name was Bu-yong.

39
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,333
He was preparing to make his debut
as a member of a boy band.

40
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,001
He was my first love.

41
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,673
But at the time,
all I could do was watch him from afar.

42
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
I couldn't say a word to him.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,682
The next time we saw each other
was the summer of junior year.

44
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,438
Have a good one.

45
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,568
Welcome.

46
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,743
Hold on.

47
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,746
You know me, don't you?

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,664
Huh?

49
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,582
We were in the same class last year.

50
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,210
Um, we were.

51
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,795
Wasn't your name Chun-ae?

52
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,340
You... Yeah, that's my name. How d'you know?

53
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,051
You have the same name as my grandma.

54
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,097
- Oh.
- Yeah, but it's such a relief, honestly.

55
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,098
What is?

56
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,476
That I have someone I know work here.

57
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,483
Sorry... you... you're not... you can't...

58
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,943
buy alcohol.

59
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,447
Can you make an exception?

60
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,879
I'm sorry, but

61
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,174
can I have a pack of Seven as well?

62
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,134
Oh, Seven.

63
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,101
Wait. You can't go and tell
anybody else, ok...

64
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,853
Yeah, of course.

65
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,902
Thank you so much, Chun-ae.

66
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,028
Bye now.

67
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,991
After that day,

68
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,951
he came by here more often.

69
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,582
I was happy that I got to talk to him,
regardless of the circumstances.

70
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,804
Hey!

71
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,599
Bu-yong sent me to get you.

72
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Me?

73
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,105
Where to?

74
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,606
Get on.

75
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,984
Where are we going?

76
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,861
It's Bu-yong's birthday,

77
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,239
and he really wanted to invite you.

78
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,009
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

79
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,137
- Damn it!
- I don't want to.

80
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,305
- Chun-ae! What's up?
- Man, I'm drunk.

81
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,183
- Hey, what's up?
- Come over here.

82
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,937
Hey, you. Move for her.

83
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,524
Come sit here.

84
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,571
What is she, a lumberjack?

85
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,156
Thanks for coming, Chun-ae.

86
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,492
Well... thank you for inviting me.

87
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,455
Have you ever drank?

88
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,875
- No. I've never really tried it.
- Oh, really?

89
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,169
My birthday will be your first time, then.

90
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,505
- Ohhh!
- Aah!

91
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,174
This is an honor, man!

92
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,759
- Oooooh!
- Hey! C'mon, drink!

93
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,096
Drink up!
Drink up! Drink up!

94
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,725
- Chug! Chug! Chug! C'mon!
- C'mon, drink up already.

95
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,269
- Chug! Chug!
- Drink it. Let's go!

96
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,771
- That's right!
- She's gulping it down!

97
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,191
- She's drinking it!
- Don't drink it all at once.

98
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,984
- Jesus Christ.
- You'll get drunk.

99
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,448
I called Yong-su's friend
to come by later.

100
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,450
- Yong-su's friend?
- Jesus!

101
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,078
- Oh. I'm sorry about that.
- It was just my shoulder.

102
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,247
You did? Yong-su's friend
is so good-looking!

103
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,249
It's crazy how much you like men.

104
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,753
- Maybe I shouldn't have called him.
- Oh, c'mon! What did I do?

105
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,074
Why aren't you inside?

106
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,118
You okay?

107
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,202
What?

108
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,455
Yeah, I'm fine.

109
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,707
Ah. See I told you to drink slowly.

110
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,752
Well, I'm okay. Don't worry.

111
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,088
- Good to hear.
- Yeah.

112
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,423
Um, Chun-ae.

113
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,176
Yeah?

114
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,723
I have something to say.

115
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,572
Could you lend me some money, please?

116
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,575
Wha... What?

117
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,578
The check came out
to be more than I expected.

118
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,414
I... How... How much?

119
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,666
Like, 200,000 won.

120
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,001
That...

121
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,711
That's a lot of money.

122
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,258
I will be getting some money next week.

123
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,218
I'll pay you back right away.

124
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,933
I'll lend it to you.

125
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,313
Thank you so much.

126
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,816
I knew
I could trust you, seriously.

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,658
Bu-yong did not pay me back,
even after a week had passed.

128
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,285
In fact,

129
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,246
he always came to see me
whenever he needed money.

130
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,046
Two bottles of soju, please.

131
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,922
Two bottles of soju,
coming right up!

132
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,466
Fried rice, please.

133
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,426
Sure thing. Two bottles of soju.

134
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,509
Thank you.

135
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,249
BU-YONG, HUGE CONGRATS ON YOUR DEBUT
YOU WERE TOTALLY AWESOME

136
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,337
- Hey! What are you doing?
- More than a month had passed...

137
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,589
- It's getting busy!
- ...but he never replied.

138
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,694
Bu-yong!

139
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,445
Don't push. Don't push!

140
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,073
Bu-yong!

141
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,666
Uh! It's so damn cold.
Seriously, fuck.

142
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,793
- Did you get the cigarettes?
- Yeah.

143
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,754
- But I don't have a lighter.
- I do.

144
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,673
Yeah, you got a lot
of folded paper cranes again.

145
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,800
Pile of trash
keeps growing bigger, damn it.

146
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,177
Fucking hell, seriously.

147
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,011
Light me up?

148
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,556
Thanks.

149
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,186
By the way, did you know her?

150
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,188
Who?

151
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,565
The girl who knew your name.
She was standing there.

152
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,528
Uh... We were
in the same class in high school.

153
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,071
Ah, same class.

154
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,116
It's not like
you hung out with her, right?

155
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,911
You fuckin' asshole.
Do you wanna die? Are you crazy?

156
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,164
- C'mon, it was a joke.
- She was one of my bank accounts.

157
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,707
- "Bank account"?
- Yeah.

158
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,543
I used to constantly
borrow money from her.

159
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,296
What the hell?
How many "bank accounts" do you have?

160
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,965
When I was at my peak, um,

161
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,176
had about ten or so.

162
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,761
You had ten?

163
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,138
You're fuckin' amazing!

164
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,639
Okay, so...

165
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,476
how much did you exactly get out of her?

166
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,937
Like, enough to buy
a luxury car.

167
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,313
Wha... That's crazy.

168
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,857
She used to be
my reliable source of income.

169
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,901
Did you do anything for her?

170
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,071
Girls like that, you call them
saying you're having a hard time...

171
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,566

BU-YONG CHOI LEAVES BOY BAND PRINCE

183
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,361
PHILIP  LEAVES BOY BAND

184
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,071
PHILIP  LEAVES GROUP

185
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,535
I wanted to become pretty.

186
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,330
That was the only goal I had in my life.

187
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,878
Hello, everyone!

188
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,046
Today, here at Gangcheon Plus Mart,

189
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,675
we are having
a three-year anniversary sale.

190
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,761
We will be holding
a big event during the sale period.

191
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,151
I thought
I would avoid him if I ever met him,

192
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,528
but strangely enough, I became curious.

193
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,196
Hey. Bu-yong Choi.

194
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,990
Don't miss out on this great deal!

195
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,199
Who are you?

196
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,035
It's me.

197
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,828
Chun-ae.

198
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,164
Huh?

199
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,750
From Seonghui High School.
You know, Chun-ae Kim.

200
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,468
I could feel the drastic change
in the way he looked at me.

201
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,386
That excited me.

202
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,154
Argh. Oof. Argh.

203
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,157
You scared me, nasty dog. Go.

204
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,166
Get up now. C'mon, I'm hungry.

205
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,334
Five minutes.

206
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Just five.

207
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,637
All he had to his name

208
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,889
was a beat-up car.

209
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,478
Bu-yong was afraid to work.

210
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,189
Maybe due to the fact
that he was a former boy band member.

211
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,817
It made me feel rather guilty.

212
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,699
Have this too.

213
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,242
All right.

214
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,665
You can stay at my place if you want.

215
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,500
Until you get a job.

216
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,463
I mean, sure.

217
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,715
But will you be okay?

218
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,260
As long as
you try your best to find a job.

219
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,596
Yeah, I will. Yeah.

220
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,726
So I had to...
find a job that made more money, for him.

221
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,644
Do you sing well?

222
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,730
Oh, a little bit.

223
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,898
How about dancing?

224
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,651
- I performed at promotional events.
- Oh, very nice.

225
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,946
Physical contact won't be acceptable here.

226
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,241
But depending on the individual,
there may be some touching.

227
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,201
So try your best to avoid them, okay?

228
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,913
We don't have rude customers
that engage in excessive physical contact,

229
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,834
but there are idiots who become,
um, dickheads if they drink a lot.

230
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,622
Soon enough,
I became the star of the club.

231
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,382
Ah, Ping-ping!
What did you do today?

232
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,261
Did you have a good time?

233
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,850
I told you
to throw out the trash this morning.

234
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,231
Why are you sitting in the dark anyway?

235
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,486
Look at this place.
It looks like a pigsty.

236
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,657
Did you smoke
inside the house?

237
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,908
With Ping-ping here?

238
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,955
Oh my God.

239
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,713
Did you even feed Ping-ping?

240
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,382
Yeah.

241
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,217
Did you or not?

242
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,845
I told you, I fed it.

243
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,027
What a load of garbage.

244
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,908
You're talking about dumb useless stuff
instead of telling me where that whore is.

245
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,077
Who said I wanna hear
your sob story, bitch?

246
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
Whoa, wait a minute!

247
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,540
The next part of the story is about her.

248
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,252
That's the truth.

249
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,422
How could you forget that?
Care to explain?

250
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,841
- He's a regular.
- Mr. Kim is a struggle for me.

251
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,595
About two months ago,
that bitch started coming out to the club.

252
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,512
Say hi to her.

253
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,723
She's the new girl that started recently.

254
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,950
- How old are you, darling?
- I'm 28 years old.

255
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,538
- Oh, then you're a year older than Mi-ae.
- Wait, I'm actually 28 as well.

256
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,208
- I lowered my age by a year.
- What?

257
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,043
Show me your IDs, then.

258
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,337
So we're clear about this from the get-go.

259
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,594
CHUN-AE KIM
DOB 06/27/1983

260
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,430
So you really were born in '83. Darling?

261
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,141
I'm sorry, I lost my ID card.

262
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,269
What?
Don't pull something like that.

263
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,479
C'mon, show us.

264
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,690
Forget it. She wouldn't
pretend to be older, after all.

265
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,526
Just work out
how you'll address each other on your own.

266
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,322
- What will be your stage name, hon?
- Pardon?

267
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,033
It's not like
you'll be using your actual name.

268
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Uh...

269
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,581
- I'll be A-reum, then.
- A-reum?

270
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,249
That's nice.

271
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,920
That bitch stole my spotlight
the moment she walked in the room.

272
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Hey.

273
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,932
I was supposed to wear that dress.

274
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,185
The boss told me to wear this dress today.

275
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,478
Take it off.

276
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,982
- C'mon, take it off!
- Hmm, damn it!

277
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,069
What's wrong, girl?

278
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,581
That whore even snatched
my regular customers from me.

279
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,417
Mr. Song, you're here.
When did you get here?

280
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Huh?

281
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,545
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

282
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:22,299
- Oh, I... I called for A-reum today.
- You're here.

283
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,092
Hey, A-reum. You're here.

284
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,802
Here we go!

285
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,932
Why did you come so late?

286
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,393
You've been coming by
more often, of course.

287
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,776
There's something called ethics
when it comes to business.

288
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,153
So why the hell
are you stealing my clientele?

289
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,573
I've never stolen anyone's stuff.

290
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,824
You haven't?

291
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,079
Then why do my regular customers
ask for you?

292
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,955
Why are you asking me that?

293
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,250
If you're curious, just ask the boss?

294
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,715
You're the bitch who led them on.
Don't drag her into this.

295
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,843
Ow!

296
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,972
Just stop fucking around.

297
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,226
Seriously, you fucking slut!

298
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,854
Stop acting like you're pretty and shit
when you got your whole face done!

299
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,648
- Damn!
- Ow!

300
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,359
Like you didn't
get your whole face done too.

301
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:27,364
- Let go of me! Let go!
- C'mon, let go! You let go first!

302
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,826
- You let go first!
- Wait a second... Let go of me!

303
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,037
Hey!

304
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,707
On the count of three, let go.

305
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,712
Okay, one, two, three!

306
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,341
I knew you'd do this,
you fucking bitch...

307
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,094
- That's what I should say...
- Hey! What are you doing?

308
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,638
Let go, right now!

309
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,810
Why are you two fighting?

310
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,397
Because! She's stolen my regulars
since day one.

311
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,651
How is that her fault, huh? Would that
have happened if you'd done better?

312
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,279
What? C'mon!

313
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,365
The ones with no skills
are always the ones who blame others.

314
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,159
Uh... hold on.

315
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,413
Now that I think about it,
I think I was in the wrong.

316
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,668
I won't do that again, Mi-ae.

317
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,673
Do you really wanna die?

318
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,134
Look at you! She even apologized to you.

319
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,387
Be the bigger person,
A-reum, will you?

320
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,056
Her personality's all twisted,
you see. Let's go.

321
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,316
Oh! It's fucking ridiculous.

322
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,620
I left the club that day.

323
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,831
And that was the last time
I saw that bitch.

324
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,218
You think I'm gonna believe that bullshit?

325
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,095
This really isn't me, I swear!

326
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,098
J... Just look! Her boobs are real.

327
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,560
But mine are silicone implants.

328
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,696
So this is... silicone?

329
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,490
Fucking hell.

330
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,619
- If you're lying, I'm gonna eat you alive.
- Ow!

331
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,165
Listen... Just, uh...
Why would I lie to you, huh?

332
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,252
I wanna kill that bitch as much as you do.

333
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,215
All right.

334
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,178
Tell me where that bitch is right now.

335
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,770
- Hey, Jin-a!
- Ah!

336
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,854
Hi.

337
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,856
How've you been?

338
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,797
- She told me she quit.
- What?

339
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,715
Why?

340
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,800
She might've moved
to a club with higher pay.

341
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,469
- Where is that?
- How would I know?

342
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,225
- Should we report her to the police?
- We can't do that.

343
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,104
I'll end her
with my own hands. Nothing will

344
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,022
stop me.

345
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,360
How about I go
to the other clubs and ask around?

346
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,363
If she's gone to a place
that pays her more,

347
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,948
that means she's become an escort.

348
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,112
If we search those places,
we'll be able to find her.

349
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,078
I'll put in some legwork.

350
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,332
That'd be nice if you do.

351
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,710
To do that, I also need some money.

352
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,255
Do you?

353
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,550
- I'm missing work to do this with you.
- How much you need?

354
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,970
- 300,000 per day?
- 100,000.

355
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,972
- Two hundred.
- Get lost, now.

356
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,349
I can find her on my own.

357
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,519
If you look into it,
everyone will know in a split second

358
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,105
that some weird lady's
going around looking for her.

359
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,733
Then, for sure,
that bitch will skip town, you know.

360
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,618
Okay, so I'll start looking around
and give you a call.

361
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,286
Report back to me regularly.

362
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:05,843
GIL STUDIO APARTMENTS

363
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,568
It's me, Chun-ae.

364
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,116
All the stories
I told that crazy woman about Mo-mi,

365
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,199
were actually...

366
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,869
- What happened to your face?
- ...all lies.

367
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,371
Let's talk inside.

368
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,713
Mr. Kim is a struggle for me.

369
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,965
It was true that I met Mo-mi at the club.

370
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,092
Oh, hello there. Say hi to her.

371
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,261
She's the new girl that started recently.

372
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,687
As I was talking to her,
I realized you were the same age.

373
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,105
You should become friends.

374
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,275
You two have a lot in common.

375
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,146
We really were like twins.

376
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,234
How we wanted
to become pretty in the past.

377
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,693
How we were hurt by others.

378
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,113
And even how we wanted to be born anew.

379
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,366
All of our memories.

380
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,117
Our lives were so alike.

381
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:35,999
A-reum.

382
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,919
Isn't this yours?

383
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,422
I found it on the makeup room floor.

384
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,174
Thank you.

385
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,552
Where did you buy it, huh?

386
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,265
Do you like it? Do you want it?

387
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,517
It's okay. No, no,
that's not what I meant.

388
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,062
Well, I... I really wanna give it to you.

389
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,145
Come here.

390
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,903
And there! It looks good on you.

391
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,782
Then, one day, out of the blue,

392
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,411
Mo-mi didn't show up at the club.
And didn't tell me.

393
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,208
Mo-mi?

394
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,297
Hey! What's wrong?

395
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,548
Are you sick?

396
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,346
Are you actually sick?

397
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,268
Hey!

398
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,645
You're burning up!

399
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,190
Hey, let's go to the hospital. Now, c'mon.

400
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,775
I'm not going.

401
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,154
What are you talking about?
You have a fever!

402
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,323
C'mon, get up. Hmm?

403
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:52,493
Let's go to the hospital, c'mon.
You're going to die at this rate!

404
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,577
C'mon, get up!

405
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,413
I said I'm not going!

406
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,128
All right, fine.
Do whatever you like, even if you die.

407
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,881
I'm leaving.

408
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,217
I can't go to the hospital.

409
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,430
What are you saying?

410
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,018
I killed a person, Chun-ae.

411
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,355
You stupid liar.

412
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,775
You're lying just to avoid
going to the hospital.

413
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,619
That's when Mo-mi told me the story
she had never told anyone before.

414
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,123
Like, why and how
she ended up here like this.

415
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,103
What are you crying for?

416
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,069
I wanted to protect Mo-mi.

417
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,448
I felt that by protecting her,
I was also protecting myself.

418
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,744
If some lady
comes to the club and asks for A-reum,

419
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,121
tell her she left for...

420
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,456
for some other place
to make more money, okay?

421
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,584
Sure, of course. But why?
Who's that old woman over there?

422
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,129
Ugh! She's trying to steal A-reum's money.

423
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,298
- Ah, those pieces of trash.
- I'm counting on you, okay?

424
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,092
You got it. Bye.

425
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,972
Get out of here, quickly.

426
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,433
That woman is gonna kill you
when she finds you.

427
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,309
I have nowhere to go.

428
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,563
Can't you go to your mom's place?

429
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,274
She's still your mom.

430
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,735
She'll help you once she knows.

431
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,822
I told you already,
my mom's not that kind of person.

432
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,537
She'll probably report me immediately
to the police when she sees me.

433
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,503
What about going abroad?

434
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,424
It's not that easy nowadays.

435
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,761
Stowing away sounds a bit scary somehow.

436
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,560
I'm sorry, Chun-ae.
For dragging you into this.

437
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,312
Don't say stuff like that.

438
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,314
Let's look for a way together.

439
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,399
I'm sure there's a way.

440
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,173
What's going on?
You never sleep anywhere else.

441
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,176
So you did know I didn't come home, huh?

442
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,386
Thought you didn't since you never called.

443
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,388
Goodness.

444
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,975
Did you feed Ping-ping?

445
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,127
I'm sorry,

446
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,004
but I would like you to leave now.

447
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,217
Do you not hear me?

448
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,344
I would like you to leave now.

449
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,639
- I don't want to.
- What?

450
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,142
I said I don't want to.

451
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,231
This is my house.

452
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,524
Get out, now.

453
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,779
And what if I say I can't?

454
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,659
I should've known
not to take in trash like you.

455
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,872
Leave before I call the police.
If you don't leave now, I'll report you.

456
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:06,955
"Trash"?

457
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,251
You're the one who's trash.

458
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,296
What?!

459
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,467
You uploaded that photo, right?

460
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,220
What do you mean?

461
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,515
You know what.
The photo that fucked up my life.

462
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,978
"Wgr00" is your ID, isn't it?

463
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,565
While I was using your computer, your ID...

464
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,403
came up as "wgr00."

465
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,077
Were you happy that you ruined my life?

466
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,581
That's not me.

467
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,833
It's not you?

468
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,877
Hmm.

469
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,923
Fuck you!

470
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,551
Fucking shit. Look, bitch...

471
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,889
just thinking about what I went through
because of you back then, seriously...

472
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,266
It's not me. I'm telling you.

473
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,935
Don't bullshit me.

474
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,522
I have evidence. Why you fucking around,
pretending it's not you, huh?

475
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:18,027
And what did you say to me?
You want me to leave your house?

476
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,696
C'mon, what the fuck!

477
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,115
Crazy, the more I think about it.

478
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,791
Listen, you fucking bitch.

479
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,962
Even if I die, I won't leave
till I get payback for what you did.

480
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,341
I won't hit your face, at least,
since you still have to work.

481
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,344
But if you scream, you die.

482
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,369
- Can I get one serving of tteokbokki?
- Sure.

483
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,125
Huh?

484
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,710
Hey.

485
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,629
You're Mask Girl, aren't you?

486
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,049
Oh, uh...

487
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,386
It's me, Teddy.

488
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,346
Teddy who?

489
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,225
Mask Girl Heart Teddy, remember?
Your fan club president.

490
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:35,104
Wow, this is surreal, so crazy!
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

491
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,189
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

492
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,233
N... No?

493
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,317
N... Now that

494
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,529
I'm seeing you with my own two eyes,
I know it's you.

495
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,615
I watched your live streams so many times.

496
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,617
I totally loved your live streams!

497
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,371
Wow, but you became really pretty.
That's crazy.

498
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,997
You know,

499
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,625
I don't think
you would've ever done such a...

500
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,294
Uh... What?

501
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,430
Hey!

502
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,389
Are you okay?

503
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,979
Uh, listen,
I know you are Mask Girl, I do.

504
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,397
I've been looking for you!

505
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,318
If you keep following me,
I'm gonna report you to the police.

506
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,819
Report me!

507
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,655
I'll totally keep it a secret
that I met you.

508
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,617
- Mask Girl, I...
- Get lost, you stalker, before I kill you.

509
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,429
Chun-ae.

510
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,017
Where are you going?

511
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,064
Let me go with you.

512
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,535
He must be sleeping.

513
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,830
- Get what you need and come back, Chun-ae.
- Okay.

514
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,480
Where are you going?

515
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,858
What?

516
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,742
You fucking bitch,
I asked you where you were going.

517
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,042
I was gonna take Ping-ping for a walk.

518
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,758
You're gonna go for a walk
with a designer purse?

519
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:19,096
Ah, fuck, at least use your brain
if you're gonna come up with an excuse.

520
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,434
Jeez!

521
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,061
You crazy bitch,
where do you think you're going?

522
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,158
It's because you haven't been hit enough.

523
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,621
- Fuck!
- No, Ping-ping!

524
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,080
Fucking mutt!

525
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,499
You trash! I'm gonna kill you!

526
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,168
Fuck off, you crazy asshole!

527
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,669
Die!

528
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,469
Oh, you fucking bitch. Come here!

529
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:02,264
You ugly piece of shit. I played with you
cause you fixed your face.

530
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,391
Think you can mess with me,
you fucking bitch?

531
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,475
Know your damn place!

532
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,355
A bitch like you needs to die.

533
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,777
Die, you fucking bitch.

534
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,403
Ah, you bitch!

535
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,996
Fuck!

536
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,400
Who the fuck is that fucking bitch?

537
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,495
Ow! Oh, fuck.

538
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,095
D... Damn it!

539
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,730
Fuck.Fuck.

540
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,282
The other way.

541
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,166
CHUN-AE KIM

542
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,509
The number you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

543
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,719
- Please leave a message...
- That sly bitch.

544
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,971
Did she run away?

545
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,772
MG LOVE
MESSAGE RECEIVED 5

546
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,065
What is this?

547
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,859
MG LOVE! MESSAGE ME!
CRAZY THING HAPPENED!!!

548
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,279
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

549
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,203
SHE MET UP WITH SOMEONE
IN FRONT OF THE MART

550
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,312
I MET THIS WOMAN TODAY
BOOBS CONFIRMED SHE'S THE REAL MASK GIRL!

551
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,363
GIRL WE THOUGHT WAS MASK GIRL
AND REAL MASK GIRL KNOW EACH OTHER

552
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,429
ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

553
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,307
Shit!

554
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,519
I'm gonna kill that...

555
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,645
Shit.

556
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,491
Oh, shit.

557
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,882
Those bitches.

558
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,230
So where do you wanna go?

559
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,109
Wherever the road leads.

560
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,114
Is there somewhere you wanna go?

561
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,369
Not really. I don't think so.

562
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,543
I think I'm pregnant.

563
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,632
Pregnant? Really?

564
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,260
Whose child is it?

565
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,805
Is it Oh-nam... Ju...

566
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,564
What are you gonna do now?

567
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,360
I'm gonna have it.

568
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,156
Are you crazy? How are you gonna
raise the baby given your situation?

569
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,659
No idea.

570
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,578
I'm sure it'll work out.

571
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,088
I wonder if it'll be ugly.

572
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,717
When it's an adult,
it can get plastic surgery.

573
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,015
I'm gonna

574
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,142
tell them that they're pretty.

575
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,730
My mom never told me
I was pretty growing up.

576
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,898
Not even once.

577
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,318
Even if the baby's ugly,

578
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,947
I'm gonna tell them they're pretty.

579
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,620
Amen!

580
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,923
Are you dumb sluts
gonna play in the water now or what?

581
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,593
She's that lady I told you about.

582
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,641
I've been waiting for this day.

583
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,187
And I can't believe my eyes,
you disgusting bitches.

584
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,236
You deserve to die painfully, bitch.

585
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,657
Is this how you dealt with my son as well?

586
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,203
Yeah! Your son, that fucking pervert,

587
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,286
I killed him.

588
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,206
What are you doing?

589
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,583
She's lying.

590
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,336
- I killed him. I did.
- Lady, it's me! I did it.

591
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,129
I'm Mo-mi Kim.

592
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,423
I'm the one who murdered your son.

593
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:19,136
No, I killed your son!
I'm Mo-mi Kim, all right!

594
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,014
Look at you two pulling this bullshit.

595
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,517
It doesn't really matter.

596
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,145
I was gonna murder you both regardless.

597
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,652
What's going on?

598
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,322
This... This fucking pile of scrap metal.

599
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,093
Chun-ae!

600
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,517
Chun-ae!

601
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,403
You fucking bitch.

602
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,738
Shit!

603
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,534
Die, bitch!

604
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,707
Oh, goodness.
I can do it. I can get to it!

605
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,233
Die, you devil!

606
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:11,081
I'll cut you up in tiny pieces
like you did to my son.

607
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,641
Chun-ae!

608
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,318
Get up. Let's go now, c'mon.

609
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,368
Let's go, c'mon!

610
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,874
Chun-ae! Look at me. Look at me.

611
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,127
Wake up.

612
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,759
No. No, no! Please...

613
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:05,927
No, please.

614
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,846
Wow, you're a star. A real star.

615
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,224
We'll be exiting now.
Opening the door.

616
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,863
- Mask Girl!
- Stand back, please.

617
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,284
The crowd and cameras
that only existed in my fantasies.

618
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,622
A flood of flashlights,
and a stage prepared just for me.

619
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,419
Everyone's eyes and interest
all focused on me.

620
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,755
I dreamed of this for so long.

621
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,524
Mask Girl!

622
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:25,116
