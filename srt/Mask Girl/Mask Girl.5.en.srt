1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:14,139
The notorious serial killer, Mask Girl,
has finally made an appearance.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,474
Rumor has it she's addicted
to plastic surgery

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,744
and right now is being escorted
into the police station.

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,353
Kim, also known as Mask Girl,

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,606
was taken in by the prosecution
as a suspect this morning.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,692
According to an insider,
Ms. Kim has admitted

7
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,403
to every single one of the charges,
including murder.

8
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,404
C'mon!

9
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,905
Excuse me, sir!

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,161
- Look over here!
- Over here!

11
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,204
- What's on the menu?
- What did she order?

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,205
It's beef bone soup.

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,124
What kind of beef bone soup?

14
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,420
MASK GIRL ORDERS BEEF BONE SOUP...

15
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,466
Looks like she did her eyes,
nose, cheekbones, chin...

16
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,384
everything, really.

17
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,513
She got herself
a whole remodeled face, basically.

18
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,098
The clothes worn by Mask Girl,

19
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,142
who's been in the spotlight
these past few days,

20
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,269
are the hottest-selling items right now.

21
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,522
Um, it's pretty, you know?
And it's popular too.

22
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,234
This crowd has gathered today
to protest against Mask Girl,

23
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,696
as the big trial against her
finally begins this morning.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,866
The accused has been attacked
and persecuted since her childhood

25
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,242
because of her appearance.

26
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,204
The victim, Mr. Jun-mo Lee,
has attacked my client,

27
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,540
Ms. Mo-mi Kim, verbally,
by repeatedly insulting her looks,

28
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,959
and physically, by attempting to rape her.

29
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,380
Through what he wrote
on social media,

30
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,674
we can clearly see
the victim's exact motives

31
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,398
when he chose to meet with the defendant.

32
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,678
The victim's social media account,

33
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,307
is evidence that he was only interested
in meeting with Mask Girl

34
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,725
out of sexual curiosity.

35
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,976
Shut up!

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,815
Your client... Your client killed my son!

37
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,650
Get off of me!

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,861
If being called ugly
is enough to make you kill someone,

39
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,780
then no one would be alive
in this country!

40
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,032
Please be quiet
or you will be asked to leave.

41
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,116
Let go of me!

42
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,244
- You dirty slut.
- Remove her.

43
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,704
- You motherfucker!
- Mom! Please, c'mon.

44
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,335
The crime in this case will be
constituted as a most serious crime.

45
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,963
The defendant's
heinous crimes against humanity

46
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,840
caused great shock to society.

47
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,677
From the standpoint
of fair punishment

48
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,345
or general crime prevention,

49
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:21,933
a sentence that forever isolates
the defendant from society is inevitable.

50
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,435
Thus, the defendant is sentenced

51
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,728
to life in prison.

52
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,841
MASK GIRL

53
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:24,138
MI-MO KIM

54
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,232
My name is Mi-mo Kim.

55
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,109
That name was given by my mom.

56
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,192
Please!

57
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,279
I'll come back for her soon!

58
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,697
I can't.

59
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,659
I won't raise your baby for you, Mo-mi.

60
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,619
I'm not asking you to raise her.

61
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,455
I'm just asking you
to look after her for a bit, that's all.

62
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,623
No. I can't.

63
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,291
Wait!

64
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,627
I'm going overseas.

65
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,922
I need to get a lot of stuff ready,
including a fake passport.

66
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,675
I can't do all of that
while carrying the baby around.

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,679
I'll come back for her as soon as I'm done
with everything. Please!

68
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,723
I'm begging you!

69
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,727
But the years went by,

70
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,812
and my mom never came back.

71
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,484
Soon enough,

72
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,612
I forgot about her existence.

73
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,413
When I was young,
I liked to doll myself up.

74
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,668
What are you doing? Oh jeez!

75
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,422
You like dressing up, like your mother.

76
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,757
Oh dear!

77
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,637
My grandma would always say
I was like my mom,

78
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,682
but she never actually
told me anything about her.

79
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,313
Put your elbows down.

80
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,196
And don't be so loud.

81
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,741
I didn't really like
the food my grandma made.

82
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,161
My favorite food

83
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,165
was the cup of tteokbokki
sold in front of my school.

84
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,958
Wow, this is incredible.

85
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,337
Then, one day, something happened,

86
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,464
and I finally learned
something about my mother.

87
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,716
- ...it's really good!
- Yeah, sure!

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,884
- Mom!
- Let's go.

89
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,678
- But I'm eating with Mi-mo!
- Don't play with her anymore.

90
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,556
- Why not? I want to!
- Her mom's Mask Girl.

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,476
- What's "Mask Girl"?
- You don't need to know.

92
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,355
MASK GIRL

93
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,026
MASK GIRL TURNS HERSELF IN

94
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,152
WHO IS MASK GIRL?

95
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,487
WHY SHE BECAME A KILLER

96
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,284
MASK GIRL SURRENDERS HERSELF
PERFECT BODY

97
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,418
Murderer!

98
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,298
Murderer's daughter!

99
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,927
Die! Die, Mask Girl, die!

100
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,229
Good afternoon. I'm reporter Mi-mo Kim.

101
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,691
Mask Girl, why did you commit murder?

102
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,364
Welcome, everyone!
There are so many of you here.

103
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,119
You can take pictures now!

104
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,997
Everyone, I am Mask Girl!

105
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,169
What's the... matter with you?

106
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,465
- I'm sorry, Grandma.
- Get out, now!

107
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,175
- Grandma! Grandma!
- Get out, now!

108
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,052
- Grandma!
- I can't do this.

109
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,096
- I'm sorry, Grandma.
- I don't think I can raise you anymore!

110
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,265
- Get out of here!
- Grandma, please!

111
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,310
I'm really sorry, Grandma.

112
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,393
Grandma!

113
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,140
Grandma...

114
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,479
what kind of person

115
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,023
was my mother?

116
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,317
Why do you ask?

117
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
I guess I'm a bit curious.

118
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,322
She was

119
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,451
a lost cause from the very start.

120
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,750
The rumors about my mom spread quickly.

121
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,877
- Monster's daughter!
- Monster's daughter!

122
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,925
And the source of the rumors

123
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,927
was my best friend.

124
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,981
- You spread the rumors.
- Hm?

125
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:22,580
There have been a lot of complaints
from other parents, you know?

126
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,169
Doesn't matter.

127
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,296
We wanted to move anyway.

128
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,596
Tteokbokki Grandma,
I'm moving away.

129
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,015
I can't come here anymore.

130
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,767
But wherever I went,

131
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,894
the rumors followed.

132
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,354
WHAT'S THIS?

133
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,605
MI-MO KIM IN SECOND GRADE

134
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,522
IS SHE CRAZY?

135
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,250
KIDS CALLED HER MASK GIRL'S KID
SO SHE'S HITTING THEM?

136
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,234
GUYS, SAW THIS?
SHE IS HELLA SCARY

137
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,986
SHE'S CRAZY
TRULY A MURDERER'S DAUGHTER

138
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,613
LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER

139
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,114
JIYA INVITED MI-MO KIM TO A CHAT

140
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,616
HEY, YOUR MOM REALLY MASK GIRL?

141
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,201
TRANSFERRED CUZ YOU BEAT A KID?

142
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,452
A REAL THUG AT SCHOOL

143
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,329
EVIL BITCH'S GONNA BEAT US UP TOO?

144
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,955
GET THE HELL OUT OF OUR SCHOOL

145
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,968
I won't be able to help you
if you cause trouble again, understood?

146
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,223
I was barely able to keep you
from being sent to juvenile detention.

147
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,233
You don't wanna become
like your mother, do you, Mi-mo?

148
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,701
Don't refer to that bitch
as my mom from now on.

149
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,537
It makes me sick.

150
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,671
Introduce yourself.

151
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,881
I'm Mi-mo Kim.

152
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,551
- Did she say "me-miaow"?
- What kinda name is that?

153
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,634
Quiet now!

154
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,887
Sit, uh?

155
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,931
There. Next to Jin-hong, okay?

156
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,039
He's a boy. I don't wanna sit there.

157
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,270
I'd like to sit with a girl.

158
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,605
- Come on, is this for real?
- Oh gosh.

159
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,941
What the heck?
That's fricking weird.

160
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,485
So, um, uh, there.
You can sit next to Ye-chun.

161
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,446
Ma'am.

162
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,950
I don't wanna sit with her.
I'd like to sit alone.

163
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,952
Pranking me, huh? Are you?

164
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,579
Sit. Go on. Have a seat.

165
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,624
You all know that finals
are right around the corner,

166
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,919
pay attention during class, okay?

167
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,755
- Okay!
- Good.

168
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,385
They're so cute, huh?

169
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,681
- Hey! I wanted to sit with a boy.
- I know, right?

170
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,142
Are they
the first couple in our class?

171
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,826
Lunch today, huh? Just three meatballs?

172
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,953
Did you see M Countdown?

173
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,207
Oh! My heart burst
because of the NCT guys.

174
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,500
They're handsome, right?

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,043
Hey.

176
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,836
That's someone else's seat, so...

177
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,466
We don't have
assigned seats in the lunchroom.

178
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,260
Hey. Get lost.

179
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,972
You're in my seat.

180
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,188
Ridiculous.

181
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,321
Are you eating alone?
I'll eat with you, okay?

182
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,828
Hey.

183
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,412
Hey, you.

184
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,667
Here, come closer.

185
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,918
I said come closer.

186
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,423
You are an outcast, did you know that?

187
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,633
What?

188
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,386
I'll be your friend.

189
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,430
- No, thanks.
- What?

190
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,850
I don't need a friend. I'm good.

191
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,812
Hey!

192
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,273
Hey!

193
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,859
Hey!

194
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,570
Wait, wait a minute.

195
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,447
So, which

196
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,951
idol group do you like?

197
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,620
Do you wanna buy these?

198
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,582
I waited for hours to get these signed.

199
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,000
- This is pretty...
- Hey, listen.

200
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,419
Get lost, will ya?

201
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,302
She's so rude. Oh my God.

202
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,932
GIRL GROUP LOVEME'S SUA
EXPLAINS PLASTIC SURGERY CONTROVERSY

203
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,105
THERE ARE 21 COMMENTS
LEAVE A COMMENT

204
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,817
A BOTOX ADDICT ACTING LIKE SHE'S HOT?
SO RIDICULOUS

205
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:06,030
LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM HER SCHOOL PHOTO
NOT THAT PRETTY

206
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,698
A NEW MESSAGE

207
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,910
TTEOKBOKKI GRANNY
ARE YOU DOING WELL AT THE NEW PLACE?

208
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,953
CALL ME WHENEVER YOU HAVE WORRIES

209
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:20,336
I'M DOING WELL!

210
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,590
Don't be late tomorrow.
And those on cleaning duty, be thorough.

211
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,091
Yes.

212
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,176
Dismissed.

213
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,183
CLEANING DUTY
MI-MO, YE-CHUN

214
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,367
Hey! Where are you going?

215
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,537
That freaking...

216
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,471
Oh, you're here.

217
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,807
So which one do you wanna buy?

218
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,017
I've got lots of them. Wanna take a look?

219
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,981
Hey, can we see it too?

220
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,691
Wow. I'm so curious.

221
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,858
Look at her!

222
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,236
Hey, that's mine! Give it back!

223
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,030
Give it back!

224
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,159
Give it back! I said it's mine!

225
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,744
- It's mine!
- Let go!

226
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,958
What?

227
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,052
It's all fake. She autographed it herself.

228
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,472
No! I... I got them autographed in person.

229
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,058
Bullshit, you lying slut.

230
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,603
She lies every time she speaks.

231
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,859
Hey.

232
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,443
Hey!

233
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,654
C'mon, get lost.

234
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,287
Didn't you hear me?

235
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,465
You're idiots.

236
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,632
- What?
- Ah!

237
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,551
What did you just say?

238
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,261
Stupid idiots.

239
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,680
- That bitch.
- What the hell? What a psycho.

240
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,390
You fucking bitch. You're dead...

241
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,353
Wanna get stabbed?

242
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,530
Hey. Hey, l... let's go.

243
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,409
- That bitch is a fuckin' psycho.
- She's fucking nuts.

244
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,078
Hey, are you okay?

245
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,581
Why did you grab a piece of glass?

246
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,417
Give me your hand.

247
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,640
You did this to yourself?

248
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,604
I tidied everything up,
so you finish cleaning.

249
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,397
Okay, sure!

250
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,175
I can't do it.

251
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,947
Hey.

252
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,960
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Wake up.

253
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,632
What is that?

254
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,711
I guess we're more alike now.

255
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,553
What the...

256
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,391
Where are you going?

257
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,726
To the bathroom.

258
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,978
Wait for me.

259
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,813
Hey! Wait for me!

260
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,989
Why are you coming in here?

261
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,245
- We're friends. It's fine.
- We're not kids.

262
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,460
Oh boy. You're a pervert.

263
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,380
That's right, I'm a pervert.
Hm-hm-hm!

264
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,361
- Here you go.
- Thank you. Have a good one.

265
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,385
Bye!

266
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,183
- What do you think? Pretty good, right?
- It's okay.

267
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,269
The tteokbokki where I used to live
was really good.

268
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,321
You know, I...

269
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,740
Hey, I have a secret, Mi-mo.

270
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,659
- Can I tell you?
- What is it?

271
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,788
I wanna murder my mother sometimes.

272
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,082
What? Why?

273
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,670
A couple of weeks ago,
I rescued a small kitten I found.

274
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,964
It was in really bad shape.

275
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,467
But Mom didn't want it!
I had to take it back, you know?

276
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,221
It's probably dead.

277
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,807
And well, I thought...

278
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,059
It's like my mom
killed the cat, basically.

279
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,228
That's your problem?

280
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,482
Yeah, that's it. What do you mean?

281
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,278
Know what? Forget it.

282
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,613
Hey. Hey!

283
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,408
What's wrong? Where are you going?

284
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,451
Uh... Hey, wait. Hey!

285
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:35,043
What's wrong? We're friends.
We can talk about stuff like that, right?

286
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,839
I don't need friends, remember?
I'm just gonna lay low until I graduate.

287
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,424
Why are you suddenly so angry?

288
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,634
You don't tell me anything about yourself.

289
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,724
You wanna know about me?

290
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,185
Mm-hmm.

291
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,982
Well, don't.

292
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,027
You wouldn't understand.

293
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,613
Hey. Hey!

294
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,867
I wouldn't understand?

295
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,953
You know what I hate dealing with, huh?

296
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,206
My dad coming home drunk
and beating my mom, okay?

297
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,501
I took a knife and almost stabbed my dad.
Did you know that?

298
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,005
You think you're
the only one with problems?

299
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,508
You think you're the only sad one
just because you hurt yourself!

300
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,724
Huh? It's raining.

301
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,143
Hey, run! Come on, run!

302
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,899
Argh!

303
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,959
Does your dad get drunk often?

304
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,127
Mm-hmm.

305
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,757
I wish my dad would just die, you know?

306
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,718
And my mom too.

307
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,639
She's not my real mom, actually. She's my

308
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,058
stepmom.

309
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,148
Well, you're better off.

310
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,441
What?

311
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,115
You...

312
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,743
won't tell anyone about this, right?

313
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,287
- Uh, no.
- Hmm.

314
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,507
I don't know...

315
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,176
I don't know who my dad is.

316
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,929
And my mom's in prison.

317
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,265
She's in prison?

318
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,768
My mom never called me. Not once.

319
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,314
She's never even wondered
about how I'm doing.

320
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,026
Then, who do you live with?

321
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,361
My grandma.

322
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,825
Your grandma never told you
anything about your mom?

323
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,910
She says she

324
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,872
hates talking about my mom.

325
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,166
It's probably my fault.

326
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,848
Well... Well... I think
you're really special, all right?

327
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,272
Could you be more cheesy?

328
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,451
Say, uh, "ah." Here.

329
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,582
You're home.

330
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,043
Why so late?
We're doing barbecue, remember?

331
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,169
Wash your hands.

332
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,795
I'm not hungry.

333
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,007
Hey, you asked for this, right?

334
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,967
I'm not hungry!

335
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,053
What? We bought a lot of meat.

336
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,472
Hey! Is something wrong?

337
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,932
No!

338
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,060
Dear God.

339
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,937
Don't know what's come over her.

340
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,648
MI-MO♥

341
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,276
She's going through puberty,
let her be. There, there, there.

342
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,445
I FREAKING HATE BEING HOME

343
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,672
MY DAD'S DRUNK AND VIOLENT AGAIN

344
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,448
REALLY? OH NO!

345
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,532
WHATEVER...

346
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,077
I'M JUST HIDING IN MY ROOM RIGHT NOW

347
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,870
Here, I'll make a wrap for you.

348
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,957
BUT I'M GLAD I HAVE YOU

349
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,959
Be careful, it's hot! It's hot.

350
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,755
AND I'M GLAD I CAN TALK
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS WITH YOU

351
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,465
HAHA
ME TOO

352
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,183
Wow, the soulmates are here.

353
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,560
You're a cute couple.

354
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,395
Miss Bed-wetter, hello!

355
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,312
What?

356
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,398
- Let's go.
- That bitch.

357
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,861
She used to be an outcast. She peed
herself in class in elementary school.

358
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,656
Everyone saw it,
so they called her "Bed-wetter."

359
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,991
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,803
Then we got to middle school,
she shortened her skirt

361
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,120
and started wearing makeup.

362
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,871
And started following the bullies around.

363
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,083
Now she's not an outcast anymore.

364
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,210
She picks on you the most.

365
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,254
- I know. Ridiculous, right?
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,005
She's a hypocrite.

367
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,640
During the Joseon Dynasty,
Seowon was a private institution...

368
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,271
...and where ancestral rites
were held for virtuous Confucian scholars.

369
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,613
You two in the back.
Go out to the hallway.

370
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,323
Oh.

371
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,457
- It was used to foster talent...
- I heard they're in love.

372
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,043
- Someone saw them making out.
- Aren't they super annoying?

373
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,128
- I heard about it.
- Really?

374
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,211
Yeah.

375
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,465
That's so crazy.

376
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,347
You're... pretty damn ugly.

377
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,476
That's nonsense.
I'd say you're pretty damn ugly.

378
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,187
- I'm not. You're the pretty damn ugliest.
- Bullshit.

379
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,899
If I'm that, then you're the pretty damn
ugliest in the whole wide world.

380
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,217
By the way,

381
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,470
why did your mom go to prison anyway?

382
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,264
Why are you asking me that?

383
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,850
I'm just curious.

384
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,274
She killed someone.

385
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,025
What?!

386
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,612
What?

387
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,825
You think I'm a monster too.

388
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,494
No, I don't.

389
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,295
My dad went crazy again yesterday.

390
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,257
He broke everything, dishes and all.

391
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,340
Really?

392
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,220
My mom left the house crying.

393
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,014
Honestly, it's a real mess.

394
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,979
Should we... run away?

395
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,940
- From home?
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,110
I like that.

397
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,947
We should, um, try to find a place
we could live together, right?

398
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,825
Don't we need a lot of money for that?

399
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,409
Do you have any?

400
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,870
I don't have money.

401
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,499
Well, so we can't afford
to run away.

402
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,337
But still, I think
it would be fun if we lived together.

403
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,421
Right?

404
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:38,443
DAUGHTER OF KOREA'S FEMALE MURDERER
MI-MO KIM

405
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,787
KOREA'S FEMALE MURDERER

406
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,170
FEMALE MURDERER'S DAUGHTER

407
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,051
CRIMINALS WHO PASS DOWN THE VIOLENT GENE

408
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,134
IS VIOLENCE GENETIC?

409
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:10,850
SERIAL KILLER MASK GIRL'S DAUGHTER
CAUGHT UP IN SCHOOL VIOLENCE SCANDAL

410
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,900
CONTROVERSY OVER THE ALLEGED
SCHOOL VIOLENCE AGAINST MS. KIM,

411
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,362
BELIEVED TO BE MASK GIRL'S DAUGHTER,
HAS ERUPTED.

412
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:26,825
THE NAME OF MASK GIRL, FORGOTTEN
BY THE PUBLIC FOR A WHILE, IS RESURFACING

413
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,245
THE PARENTS OF STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL
ARE VERY CONCERNED

414
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,288
NEARLY FORGOT, BUT MG IS BACK!

415
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,417
SHE USED TO GO TO MY SCHOOL
BUT TRANSFERRED TO SEONGRIM

416
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,134
Ye-chun! Ye-chun!

417
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,678
What?!

418
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,556
- I need you to feed the baby.
- Uh! Mom, I'm busy!

419
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,058
You're not getting any allowance, then.

420
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,311
Where's the baby food?

421
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,271
Here.

422
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,111
- Say "ah."
- All dressed!

423
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,822
Honey, come over and eat
if you're done dressing him up.

424
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,699
- Ah!
- We gotta be quick, okay?

425
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,782
Yummy, huh?

426
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,619
Okay, let's eat!

427
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,621
Guess what?

428
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,958
I'm friends with Mask Girl's daughter.

429
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,459
Isn't that amazing?

430
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,880
I feel bad for Mi-mo, you know?

431
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,382
So I'm never going to leave
my friend's side ever.

432
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,009
Yeah, I should help her.

433
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,264
But I need money if I wanna help her, huh?

434
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,103
- Sheep.
- Huh?

435
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,984
Chicken.

436
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,405
Horse.

437
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,784
Ahh!

438
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,955
Uh, it rolls well.

439
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,706
The sounds?

440
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,920
Yeah, it works.

441
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,548
Huh?

442
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,632
Huh?

443
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,260
Uh, the lion button's not working.

444
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,012
Yeah.

445
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,723
- I don't know why it won't...
- Yeah, the lion.

446
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,476
Talk to you soon. Sure.

447
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,773
Oh, it, uh... it was working up until now,
it really was.

448
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,906
So, uh, what if
I bring it down to 30,000 won?

449
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,617
- Thank you!
- Have a good one.

450
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Bye.

451
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,789
Are you sure it's okay to sell that?

452
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,250
It's fine. She'll be walking soon anyway.

453
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,760
So together we have 138,000 won.

454
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,638
This is nowhere near enough.

455
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,185
I don't have anything else to sell.

456
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,062
What do we do now?

457
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,235
Oh... I could ask my tteokbokki grandma.

458
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,446
- "Tteokbokki grandma"?
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,575
Remember how I said there was an awesome
tteokbokki truck where I used to live?

460
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,787
She's like a real grandma to me.

461
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,207
She told me I should talk to her
if I needed anything.

462
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,710
We could ask her for help.

463
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,883
I kinda think
we could pull this off by ourselves.

464
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,851
Mi-mo, wait a little while.
I'll try to come up with something.

465
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,687
You won't. We'll do it together.

466
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,313
I'll try to find a way too.

467
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,481
Mm-hmm.

468
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,572
Hey.

469
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,700
Can I talk to you for a minute?

470
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,118
Why?

471
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,042
Wow. Are these real?

472
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,836
Hey! Of course they're real.

473
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,629
Do you like them?

474
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,549
So... do you think you wanna get one?

475
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,718
They're 20,000 won,

476
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,804
but you're so cute,
I'll give it to you for half the price.

477
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,682
I don't have the money, though.

478
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,226
How much money do you have?

479
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,937
Five hundred won.

480
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,360
That's okay. I'll take it for now.

481
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,739
In return, tell your friends
about me, huh?

482
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,822
Sure!

483
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,368
- Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.
- What a freakin' joke.

484
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,830
- Kids still do this kinda stuff?
- That's so pathetic.

485
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,874
Hey, you. Is there a problem?

486
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,460
A middle schooler
taking money from a little kid?

487
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,128
You're small, so...

488
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,172
Listen, you little fuck.

489
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,800
Don't take money
from little kids, understood?

490
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,720
Hey, take your 500 won and go home.

491
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,812
- Where do you think you're going?
- Hey, grab her!

492
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,397
- Don't even think about running.
- So sad.

493
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,368
That's what you get.

494
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,414
You ratted me out to them, didn't you?

495
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,501
Bed-wetter.

496
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,879
What did you say?
Aren't you scared of dying?

497
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:36,175
Let me go! If you keep this up,
you should be scared of dying.

498
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,052
Should I, bitch?

499
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,805
I'm gonna hit you
every time you lie to me, you got that?

500
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,014
Wait!

501
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,476
Mi-mo's mom, you know who she is?

502
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,062
"Mi-mo"? Mi-mo Kim?

503
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,316
What? Is her mom rich or something?

504
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,717
Hey, kid.

505
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,520
SUSEONG POLICE SUBSTATION

506
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,855
How may I help you?

507
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,570
- Oh!
- I told you, didn't I? For the last time.

508
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,031
Uh, ma'am, ma'am. You can't do this here.

509
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:40,990
Get outta my house!

510
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,467
- Right now, you hear me?
- Hey, hey!

511
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,243
Huh?!

512
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,078
I wasn't planning

513
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,331
on staying with you anyway.

514
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,333
What did you say?!

515
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,216
Hey, kid!

516
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,650
Hey! Where have you been?
Why are you home so late?

517
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,693
I was at a friend's house.

518
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,239
Well, you should've called us
at least, you know?

519
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,165
Ugh, leave me alone!

520
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,627
Have you seen the baby walker? Uh...

521
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,505
Why are you asking me?
Just leave me alone!

522
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,344
- Hasn't seen it?
- She says she hasn't.

523
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,389
Jesus, where on earth did it go?

524
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Hello?

525
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,773
- What are you up to?
- Me?

526
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,650
Mmm, not much. I'm home.

527
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,195
Can I come over to your place tonight?

528
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,488
My place?

529
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,865
My place, why?

530
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,575
You know...

531
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,745
Don't wanna go home, that's all.

532
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,788
Oh...

533
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,666
Is that a no?

534
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,877
Just for the night.

535
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,175
I, uh... I really want you to, but...

536
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,930
It's just... my dad, uh,
he threw stuff again. It's a mess.

537
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,432
Really? Hey,

538
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,183
are you okay?

539
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,602
Yeah, it's just...
my place is a complete mess.

540
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,272
I wanna run away from home.

541
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,776
Mi-mo, you should go back
to your grandma tonight, and...

542
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,323
and... we can leave... when we're ready.

543
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,950
Okay.

544
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,871
Okay. I'll see you at school tomorrow.

545
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,252
Shit.

546
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,302
Hey, did you hear the news?
About Mi-mo Kim from Class Two?

547
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,137
"Mi-mo Kim"? Who's that?

548
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,141
Well, she transferred here recently,
and she's Mask Girl's daughter.

549
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,018
"Mask Girl"? Who's that?

550
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,939
Y'know, the PangTV psycho killer?
She was on TV and all.

551
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,107
Whoa, really?

552
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,236
Fuckin' unbelievable.
Y'know why she transferred to our school?

553
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,404
Why?

554
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,031
Apparently,
she stabbed a kid with a pencil.

555
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,200
- So...
- What the hell? That's crazy!

556
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,994
That means we go to the same school
as a serial killer's daughter!

557
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,289
My mom's making a complaint
to the Office of Education

558
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,333
to try to get her to leave the school.

559
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,552
- Jeong-guk Kang.
- Here.

560
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,512
- Na-rae Kim.
- Here.

561
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,763
Mi-mo Kim.

562
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,476
Ye-chun. Is Mi-mo late?

563
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,104
I haven't seen her yet.

564
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,693
- Jin-hong Kim.
- Here.

565
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,653
- Ha-eun Kim.
- Here.

566
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,870
MI-MO, WHERE ARE YOU?

567
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,541
- Just a second.
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,625
Ye-chun.

569
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,044
Yes?

570
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,130
Can I have a word with you for a minute?

571
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,550
According to Mi-mo's grandmother,

572
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,053
Mi-mo hasn't come back home
since yesterday, unfortunately.

573
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,639
Do you know anything, by chance?

574
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,731
You're, uh,
Mi-mo's closest friend, isn't that right?

575
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,233
Yeah, that's true.

576
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,612
But I don't know where she is.

577
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,476
The number you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

578
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,520
Please leave a message after the tone.

579
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,075
The number you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave...

580
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,077
Dang it, why aren't you picking up?

581
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,085
Where the heck are you?

582
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,881
- Ye-chun!
- Ye-chun!

583
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,467
- Hey.
- What's with the long face?

584
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,010
Did something happen at school?

585
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,679
- No, nothing.
- Huh?

586
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,181
We bought fried chicken,
your favorite. Let's go.

587
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,642
- We got fried chicken.
- We bought two boxes. Let's go.

588
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,936
- It'll be a fried chicken party!
- Yay!

589
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,063
Every other day!

590
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:46,981
So?!

591
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,484
Since our daughter likes chicken,
we can have one every day.

592
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,572
Okay, then. Let's party every day.
Let's have fried chicken tomorrow too!

593
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,158
Why aren't you eating?

594
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,787
I'll give you the leg today.

595
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,039
Usually, we'd auction it off...

596
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,708
...but I'll give it to ya this time.

597
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,834
MI-MO♥

598
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,337
No, no, I'm full. I can't eat anymore.

599
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,381
Wha... Already?

600
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,008
Well, I'll eat it, then!

601
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,634
Hey, Mi-mo Kim, where are you?

602
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,219
Can you come meet me?

603
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,264
Yeah, of course. Where are you?

604
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,684
Oh, the underpass?
Okay, got it. Stay right there!

605
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,900
Hey! Mi-mo Kim!

606
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,027
Hey!

607
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,614
Do you know how worried I was?

608
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,950
Why did you turn your phone off?

609
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,959
Why are you looking at me

610
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,543
like that?

611
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,295
Mi-mo!

612
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,547
Hey!

613
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,678
How could you do that?

614
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,513
What do you mean?

615
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,893
- You spread the rumors, right?
- "Rumors"?

616
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,145
What are you talking about?

617
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,649
- You spread the rumors about me!
- What rumors?!

618
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,112
How could
you do this to me? How could you?

619
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,907
Hold on!
Mi-mo, why are you doing this?

620
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,575
No, stop!

621
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,744
And you lied to me! You bitch!

622
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,498
Wait, Mi-mo. Listen to me.
I didn't spread any rumors about...

623
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,209
Shut up, you backstabber!
