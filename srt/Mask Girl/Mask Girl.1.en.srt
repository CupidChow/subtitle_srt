1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,719
Mo-mi, are you ready?

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,016
Wow! Wasn't that
a great performance?

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,769
Next, we have a solo performance
by Miss Mo-mi Kim from Love Kindergarten!

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,938
Please give her a big round of applause.

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,999
My name is Mo-mi Kim.

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,378
When I was younger,
my dream was to become a celebrity.

7
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,176
Nothing made me as happy
as dancing onstage.

8
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:18,787
The sound of people cheering
and applauding made me so, so happy.

9
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,543
But eventually,

10
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,588
my looks made it hard
for my dreams to come true.

11
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,758
Whoo!

12
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,426
What are you doing?

13
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,684
You wanna be a singer
with those looks?

14
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,021
Maybe in your dreams.

15
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,861
I've always wondered

16
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,366
how is it possible
that my mom is pretty, but I'm not.

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,416
SUJEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL TRIP
TALENT SHOW

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,419
Even in middle school nothing changed.

19
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,339
Actually, it got worse.

20
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,466
Wow, she's ugly!

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,260
Loser. How boring.

22
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,304
Next up is a performance
by Class Five from Grade Eight.

23
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,015
Give them a big round of applause!

24
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:41,119
THE 8TH SCHOOL FESTIVAL
JEONGMIN GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

25
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,375
Hey. You're blocking the view.

26
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,418
Scooch down, c'mon.

27
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,130
More.

28
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,008
Good.

29
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,430
As time went by,

30
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,599
my dream slowly faded away.

31
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,564
I am already 27 years old,

32
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,359
and despite my will
to live a different life,

33
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,488
I ended up having
an ordinary, uneventful one.

34
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,936
But the sound
of applause and cheering

35
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,271
is still my favorite thing to hear.

36
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,420
Hi everyone.

37
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,714
Let's get started
with tonight's live stream.

MO-MI KIM

52
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,764
Hey. Mo-mi.

53
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,309
Hey, Sang-sun.

54
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,398
So, you look beat, what happened?

55
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,902
- Do I?
- Your face looks really rough.

56
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,779
You've been looking like that
a lot recently.

57
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,365
You do something else after work?

58
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,617
No, I don't.

59
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,368
Yeah?

60
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,915
Mr. Oh, have some coffee.

61
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,167
Oh, thank you, thank you.

62
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,418
Mr. Kim?

63
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,547
- Have some coffee.
- Oh, thank you!

64
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,548
Oh, this is great.

65
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,135
You make the best coffee
in this office, A-reum.

66
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,554
It's just a mix,
instant coffee, so...

67
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,515
No way. It really tastes different.

68
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,476
The person who makes the coffee
can have a big impact.

69
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,105
You're in another league.

70
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,358
Yeah, you're right.

71
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,152
A whole different league, for sure.

72
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,946
Those frickin' old men.

73
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,698
- Pissing me off and it's only morning.
- Tell me about it.

74
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,117
They don't even know
that's sexual harassment.

75
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,619
I'll report them to HR one day.

76
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,538
They need to be taught a lesson.

77
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,707
Why is A-reum strutting around,
handing out coffee?

78
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,918
She's a disgrace
to female employees.

79
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,004
I think she got work done
on her eyes and nose.

80
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,924
Nothing gets past ya.

81
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,717
She uses bra pads too.

82
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,471
- She's probably not even a 34A.
- I don't like her at all.

83
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,683
She's new to the team
and already flirting left and right.

84
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,103
- She's so full of herself.
- Oh, hello. Good morning.

85
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,606
- Hey, Mr. Park's here.
- Yeah, good morning. Mm-hmm. Hello.

86
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,292
- Mr. Park.
- Hey.

87
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,003
- Have some coffee.
- Oh, I'm okay, thanks.

88
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,796
Well...

89
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,382
I'll have some, then.

90
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,093
And by the way, Ms. Lee.

91
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,179
You don't have to do this, you know?

92
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,224
You're not here to make coffee, are you?

93
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,435
Right. Understood, sir.

94
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,354
As expected of Mr. Park,

95
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,609
he is... so different from other men.

96
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,319
A MONTH AGO

97
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,072
When comparing the net profit
made in '07 and '08 by competitors,

98
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,451
who were late to enter
the business of smart mobile systems...

99
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,412
They say
that when you fall in love with someone,

100
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,497
a new universe gets opened.

101
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:28,669
It feels like the world you knew
until yesterday suddenly disappears.

102
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,671
...2000s, when the system was developed,

103
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,050
our position has been unmatched
as the industry's leader.

104
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,386
Therefore, for the next ten years...

105
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,889
He's as tall as a model.

106
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,891
And he can pull off any suit.

107
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,061
His broad shoulders...

108
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,063
he's so hot.

109
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,106
His face screams intelligence.

110
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,983
He can seem cold sometimes...

111
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,987
- Hello.
- ...but he's actually very kind.

112
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,114
He's so good at his job.

113
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,950
He climbed the promotion ladder superfast.

114
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,411
The only downside to this perfect man

115
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,748
is that he's a married man.

116
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,629
I know I shouldn't be doing this,

117
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,965
but whenever I notice
he's focused on his work,

118
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,967
I can't take my eyes off of him.

119
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,699
Oh my God.

120
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,244
She looks so good now.

121
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,916
DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS
WHERE'D YOU GET YOUR NOSE DONE?

122
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,334
INFORMATION, PLEASE?

Thank you for the 5,000 hearts!

142
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,033
I'm completely wet,
so I'll go change real quick.

143
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,037
Sorry I kept you waiting.

144
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,206
I changed my hairstyle. Do you like it?

145
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,832
Do you think it's pretty, hmm?

146

YOU LOOK GOOD IN ANYTHING

147
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,876
Am I pretty?

148
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,439
SO PRETTY
IT'S PRETTY! YOU'RE THE BEST

149
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,630
You wanna know what my face looks like?

150
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,590
I WON'T VOMIT. YOU MUST BE HELLA UGLY

151
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,883
Ah...

152
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,676
ONCE UPON A PRINCE: IGNORE THOSE COMMENTS

153
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,220
THERE ARE SO MANY WEIRDOS AROUND

154
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,679
Don't worry, guys.

155
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,474
Stuff like that
doesn't hurt me.

156
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,728
Besides, you do know
that these are real, right?

157

162
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,744
Ms. Mo-mi Kim.
Didn't you study accounting?

163
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,457
How on earth could you get
the most basic accounting concept wrong?

164
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,043
I'm sorry, sir.

165
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,851
What are you doing?

166
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,484
That was too harsh, wasn't it?
Embarrassing you in front of everybody.

167
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,988
There's a lot of guys out there
who think they're the shit

168
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,699
and don't know how to be kind
to other people, so...

169
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,909
I call them "workplace bullies," you know?

170
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,663
You've seen Park's social media,
haven't you?

171
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,249
I don't follow him, so no.

172
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,334
Mr. Park has an illness.

173
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:38,919
What?

174
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,337
Douchebag scum disease.

175
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:45,676
Like, why... would he post pictures
of his abs on there? It's gross. I mean...

176
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,429
For real? He posted that?

177
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,765
Can you show me those?

178
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,895
You're sick too, apparently.

179
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,772
How am I the only normal person
in this company?

180
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,858
Hey! Where are you going?

181
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,277
Come on! Show me the abs!

182
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,613
What do you call a bear...

183
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,530
Yeah.

184
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,575
...who fell from a cliff
and broke all his teeth?

185
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,577
Um...

186
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,703
A tooth...

187
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,704
Tooth...

188
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,622
Tooth...

189
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,705
A gummy bear.

190
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,499
Gummy bear...

191
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,045
Wow! Gummy bear!
Gummy bear! Wow!

192
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,380
That was a great one.
Oh no, is that empty?

193
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,633
Mr. Park? Can I pour you a glass?

194
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,093
Oh no, it's all right.
I'll do it myself, hmm?

195
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,556
Mr. Park, uh, when a pretty girl like her
offers you a drink, you should accept.

196
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,891
All good. All good.

197
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,310
- Anyway, A-reum, I'll take it, then.
- Ah, sure.

198
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:44,234
Mr. Oh. What you said and did just now
is sexual harassment, you know?

199
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,364
Why would you say that?
I just asked her to pour me a drink.

200
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,241
She's my junior employee.
How is this sexual harassment?

201
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,160
- Listen...
- That's not what I'm saying.

202
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:57,081
You know, Mr. Park doesn't like
female employees pouring him drinks.

203
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,083
- Oh. I see.
- She's a junior employee.

204
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,846
Doesn't matter if they're a man
or a woman. You're being ridiculous.

205
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,879
Is a man touching a woman's chest

206
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,756
the same as a woman
touching a man's chest?

207
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,467
Ms. Yoo, did I happen to ask
to touch her chest?

208
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,320
- Try to calm down.
- I just asked for a drink.

209
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,929
- Is this her chest?
- Yeah, yeah.

210
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,473
- I'm just saying.
- Whoa. That's enough.

211
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,225
By the way, Mr. Park.

212
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,479
Ooh! Did you happen to hear about this?

213
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,650
- What is this?
- It's a new trend. Very popular, you know?

214
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,026
They show up, start streaming,

215
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,612
and everyone sends them
Heart Pangs left and right!

216
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,907
- Gets really crazy, you know?
- Wha... What are "Heart Pangs"?

217
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,076
Basically money, of course.

218
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,621
Lots of people have been doing it,
and they're making a lot of money.

219
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,332
Ah!

220
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,751
Young people
are out of their minds these days.

221
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,045
Look,
the most popular one on here...

222
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,630
Here. Mask Girl.

223
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,969
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

224
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,722
- Here.
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

225
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,099
- I'm sorry.
- Whoa, Mr. Kim. Seriously?

226
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,102
Watching that kinda stuff?
I'm so disappointed.

227
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,396
"That kinda stuff"?
What do you mean by that?

228
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,691
I'm just trying to keep up
with the latest trends, that's all.

229
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,234
The latest trends!

230
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,320
That guy's a jerk.
"Keep up with the trends," my ass.

231
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,615
I'm sure he gets off by himself
while watching that dirty stuff.

232
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,827
Uh, those live streams are not that dirty.

233
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,910
What?

234
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,245
Huh?

235
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:25,252
Well, that stuff is called, uh... new media.
I read an article about it.

236
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,796
People like interacting
like that these days, so...

237
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,674
Yeah. "New media"? C'mon.

238
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,216
Well,

239
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,220
if you're going for a second round,
go for it.

240
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,806
I'll be going home, I'm afraid.

241
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,560
What are you talking about? No!
Mr. Park, you have to come with us!

242
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,980
Yeah, that would be great,
but my wife said she's not feeling well.

243
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,566
- Ah! Oh! Well, that's rough.
- Hmm.

244
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,485
Yeah, you should go. Goodbye.

245
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,778
Wait a second. My phone.

246
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,697
Ah! You left something
at the table again, huh?

247
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,826
Well. So, how about round two?
Just us? Cool?

248
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,078
Cool!

249
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,248
- Hell yeah!
- I'm sorry, but I should go home as well.

250
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,794
Um, my mom is visiting tonight, so...

251
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,339
Hey, c'mon. Didn't you say
you don't even talk to your mom?

252
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,258
What are you saying?
Why wouldn't I talk to her?

253
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,720
Sure, yeah, you can go home.
Your mom is visiting you from far away.

254
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,305
So sure, go home. Uh...

255
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,847
- A-reum.
- Uh-huh?

256
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,391
You coming with us, right?

257
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,644
Uh... of course!

258
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,355
- Okay!
- Okay!

259
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,273
What about you?

260
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,358
Any other plans?

261
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,942
I'm afraid not.

262
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,571
Wait, what? Don't you...
Don't you have something to do at home?

263
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,655
Mr. Oh.

264
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,242
- Mr. Oh.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,453
I'm aware of how you feel,
but how could you say that to her face?

266
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,871
Oh, I'm sorry.

267
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,872
Mr. Kim!

268
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,042
- Right, I'm going home now.
- Yes, sir!

269
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,712
- Don't drink too much, okay?
- Goodbye, sir.

270
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,797
- Taxi!
- Bye!

271
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,300
- Mr. Park?
- Hmm?

272
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,804
Could we, maybe,
if you don't mind, share a taxi?

273
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,473
- You live by Cheonpo-gu's office, right?
- Hmm?

274
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,643
I moved to Osan Pass, you know, so...

275
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,353
Oh, you did.

276
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,938
Sure. Get in.

277
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,905
Thank you so much.

278
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,284
No worries. It's on the way, no problem.

279
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,918
Uh, hello?

280
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,089
Yeah, I'm on my way right now.

281
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,173
Yeah.

282
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,801
No, no, I didn't drink a lot. Mm-hmm.

283
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,888
Well, I should be home in thirty, I guess.

284
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,347
Right now?

285
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,438
I'm alone. Why?

286
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,858
Everyone went for another round.

287
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,323
Okay, sure. Yeah. I'll see you in a bit.

288
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,449
Yeah.

289
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,707
Oh, that was my wife.

290
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,668
Oh, right.

291
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,847
Thank you! I'll see you tomorrow.

292
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,349
Sure. No worries.

293
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,699
Why did Mr. Park say he was alone?

294
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,995
Why did he try to hide the fact
that I was with him?

295
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,624
Was he conscious of me?

296
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,459
But why?

297
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,087
Is it possible?

298
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,945
ONCE UPON A PRINCE: I WAS WAITING FOR YOU!

299
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,970
HI
LET'S GET STARTED

300
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,098
Guys, um... I wanna ask you something.

301
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,724
Is that okay?

302
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,934
WHAT IS IT?
ASK AWAY!

303
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,020
I got into a taxi with my boss tonight.

304
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,230
He's married.

305
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,108
No! No! I didn't do it on purpose.

306
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,194
Our houses were just
in the same direction, that's why.

307
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,278
Anyway.

308
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,323
While we were in the taxi,
he got a call from his wife.

309
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,909
But even though
he was in the taxi with me,

310
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,913
he lied to his wife
and told her that he was alone.

311
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,751
Hmm, why do you think he did that?

312
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,555
BRAD PIT:
HE COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO EXPLAIN

313
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,839
He could've just said
he was sharing the taxi

314
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,049
with someone going in the same direction.

315
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,259
HE HAS THE HOTS FOR YOU

316
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,303
That's what it seems like, right?

317
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,138
BRAD PIT: YOU'RE SO DELUSIONAL

318
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,683
'BRAD PIT' HAS BEEN REMOVED

319
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,268
Then how... How about this?

320
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:55,856
A while back, I told him like,
"Oh, your perfume smells really nice."

321
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,401
And ever since I said that,
he's been wearing the same one.

322
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,764
LOOKIE LOOKIE
JUST A COINCIDENCE?

323
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,808
'LOOKIE LOOKIE' HAS BEEN REMOVED

324
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,906
But of course, as I'm sure you all know,

325
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,451
I don't have feelings for him. Not at all.

326
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,245
HANDSOME MONK: CAREFUL OF MARRIED MEN!
NEED TO DRAW A CLEAR LINE

327
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,747
Yeah, you're right.

328
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,999
I should really draw the line.

329
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,852
ONCE UPON A PRINCE:
IF YOU DATE THAT MAN, I'LL KILL MYSELF

330
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,129
Hmm. I'm so touched!

331
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,467
Guys, you do know
that I'll always be yours, right?

332
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,218
I'm never gonna leave you!

333
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,845
200 HOT HIGHSCHOOLER
1000 MADAM FANTASY

334
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,722
I love all of you!

335
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,059
I love you!

336
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,523
Why does he look so serious today?

337
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,077
Hmm.

338
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,548
Breaking news!
Mr. Park updated his social media!

339
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,136
PARK GI-HUN'S PAGE

340
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,615
THINKING...
DEEP IN THOUGHT IN THIS COLD CITY

341
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,892
God, this needs an intervention.
He needs treatment, doesn't he?

342
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,771
This is serious, it really is.

343
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,023
Just how many times
has it been?!

344
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,899
Sorry, Mr. Park.

345
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,902
Do it again.

346
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,378
What's gotten into him?
He's even scolding that flirty fox.

347
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,131
Work is work.
You mess up, you get scolded.

348
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,008
You know Mr. Park is serious
when it comes to work.

349
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,907
Do you have a lot left to do?

350
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,535
Oh, well, no. I'm nearly done, actually.

351
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,744
Mmm. All right.

352
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:21,001
Oh... don't beat yourself up
about, uh, Mr. Park yelling at you.

353
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,713
He's, uh, kinda nice,
but he can be a little

354
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,549
cold, um, about work.

355
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,260
Ah. Sure.

356
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,220
Um, I'll be off, then.

357
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,346
- Bye.
- Bye.

358
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,414
Come on, don't be like that.

359
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,627
I did that so no one could say
I was favoring you, you know?

360
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:50,298
Still, you were too mean. I don't like it
when you do that in front of other people.

361
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,593
Okay, okay.
You're prettier when you're angry.

362
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,091
MASK GIRL! YOU'LL GET SUSPENDED

363
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,230
THOSE ARE REAL BOOBS
OH NO. MASK GIRL:(

364
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,564
SHIT, I'M LATE. SHARE THE VIDEO

365
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,608
COULD'VE SEEN HER FACE
IF SHE WENT ON A BIT

366
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,127
BUT THE MASK STAYS ON
FUCK! IS SHE NUTS?

367
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,361
A REAL-TIME NUDE SHOW, CRAZY

368
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,884
ALL NUDE, FUCKING CRAZY
WHAT A SHAME!

369
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:23,326
CHAT SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED
DURING SUSPENSION

370
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:30,542
STREAMER SUSPENDED DUE TO VIOLATION
OF RULES AND CONDUCT DURING LIVE STREAM

371
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,007
STREAMER SUSPENDED DUE TO VIOLATION
OF RULES AND CONDUCT DURING LIVE STREAM

372
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,260
A REAL-TIME NUDE SHOW, CRAZY
ALL NUDE, FUCKING CRAZY

373
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,053
Die.

374
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,472
Die, Mo-mi Kim.

375
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,558
Just die. You deserve to die!

376
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,647
This is all because of A-reum.

377
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,357
That deceitful bitch.

378
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,860
If it hadn't been for her...

379
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,612
Hey, over here! Mo-mi.

380
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,449
- Hey, c'mon.
- There you are.

381
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,409
- I'm starving.
- You're always late.

382
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,661
What? That's your phone? An iPhone?

383
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,831
These are the colleagues
I regularly meet up with.

384
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,875
I went stress shopping and got one.

385
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,585
Once they start talking,

386
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:59,005
it's only a matter of time
until the rumors start spreading.

387
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,509
By the way...

388
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,844
I saw something

389
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,180
strange recently.

390
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,265
Something strange? What's up?

391
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,892
Well...

392
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,104
Forget it.

393
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,486
- I hate it when you do that, you know?
- How annoying.

394
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,322
- Seriously. What is it?
- Come on, just tell us.

395
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,200
- Yeah, what the heck?
- It's a big secret, though.

396
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,577
Don't tell anyone, okay?

397
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,205
Of course! You can trust us!

398
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,711
- Really?!
- Wow, I just got chills.

399
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,088
I'm not that surprised.

400
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,881
Doesn't Mr. Park have a kid?

401
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,675
- He does!
- Good morning!

402
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,260
Oh! Hello, sir!

403
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,887
Mm-hmm. Oh. Enjoy your coffee.

404
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,726
A-reum's so cute, man.

405
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,064
That Mr. Park is a fuckin' piece of shit.

406
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,025
He has it all but wants more, that jerk.

407
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,779
I mean, how could she do that, though?

408
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,863
I know, right?

409
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,616
Doesn't she feel bad for the man's wife?

410
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,412
She probably thinks that
they're both gonna get away with it, huh?

411
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,425
Wow!

412
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:29,345
New gossip. Apparently, A-reum's pregnant,
and she's still coming into work.

413
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,055
- Come on!
- I know, right?

414
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,599
No, she already had the baby,

415
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,059
and he's been leading a double life
for a while.

416
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,519
- Oh my gosh.
- Isn't it wild?

417
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,687
What? Really?

418
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,398
That's not true at all!

419
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,609
Leading a double life?

420
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,486
They have a kid? That's ridiculous.

421
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,789
Mr. Park and A-reum
are in a meeting with HR.

422
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,708
Really? Why?

423
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,377
Why else?
They found out about their affair.

424
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,712
Oh no!

425
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,298
What do you mean?
You. Told. Everyone.

426
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,523
Um, excuse me...

427
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,359
Yes?

428
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,156
Uh, it's nothing.

429
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,782
Nothing.

430
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:00,894
Oh!

431
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,230
Sorry about that.

432
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,441
Taxi!

433
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,776
Taxi!

434
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,111
Taxi!

435
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,613
Shucks!

436
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,700
They already...

437
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,868
Everyone... Left.

438
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,038
They all left.

439
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:24,002
All... all gone.

440
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,548
Mr. Park.

441
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,262
What the hell?

442
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,017
A telephone pole is talking.

443
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,645
What the heck is goin' on?

444
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,982
Whoa! Mr. Park, are you okay?

445
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,575
- Uh, screw it.
- Oh... Uh... Mr. Park, you're very drunk.

446
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,869
What are you doing? Let go!

447
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,414
Hey, let go. Just... Let go!

448
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,002
- I'm going to die!
- Wait, don't!

449
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,171
- What are you doing?!
- I'm going to die!

450
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,591
- Don't!
- Actually almost died.

451
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,469
Hey! Taxi!

452
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,584
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

453
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,087
Uh, Mr. Park.

454
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,466
Pull yourself together, come on. Okay?

455
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,095
We're, uh, at Cheonpo-gu's office,
right here.

456
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,640
Where did you say you live? Huh?

457
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,600
Oh. Mr. Park!

458
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,067
What, really?

459
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,279
There's no saving them.

460
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,906
Stupid company.

461
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,992
MOTEL

462
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
Uh...

463
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,963
Your clothes are soaking wet.

464
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,684
Uh!

465
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,938
Oh, Mr. Park.

466
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,444
Uh, we shouldn't...
We shouldn't be doing this.

467
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,739
We shouldn't. Don't you think so...

468
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,400
Oh f... Shit!

469
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,023
Do you think it's okay to be late
now that Mr. Park isn't around?

470
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,859
What? A delay at the subway again?

471
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,654
I guess the subway
was really delayed.

472
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,664
Mr. Park decided to quit,
and A-reum was transferred, so...

473
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,088
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

474
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,841
You didn't happen to send
the sales data yesterday, right?

475
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,675

NEW MESSAGE
TO: OFFICE MANAGER PARK GI-HUN

492
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,746
MR. PARK, I'D LIKE TO MEET WITH YOU

493
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:24,296
We're now entering Hapjeong.
Hapjeong. Doors will open both sides.

494
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,381
Hey.

495
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,175
What was that?

496
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,385
What?

497
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,763
You just touched me.

498
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:37,435
- What do you mean, touched you?
- You touched my butt just now, didn't you?

499
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,018
I did?

500
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,313
Are you hallucinating?

501
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,649
Why would I touch your butt?

502
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,485
You... You did it.
You touched my butt, you jerk.

503
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,410
- Get off!
- Uh, why should I get off?

504
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,912
- I'm telling you, get off!
- Why do I have to get off?

505
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,164
Get off, right now!

506
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,623
Ow!

507
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,170
And, um, you're sure he touched you?

508
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,214
Well, why would I tell you
if I wasn't sure?

509
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,884
Can you prove I actually touched you?

510
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,845
She's trying to frame an innocent person.

511
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,139
Look in the mirror, c'mon.

512
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,100
Why on earth
would I touch someone like you?

513
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,644
Sir, please don't say that, c'mon.

514
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,855
- You bastard! You little pervert!
- Ah! Sh...

515
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,566
- You touched me. Now what?
- Stop that!

516
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,236
What are you gonna do now?!
You sent the email, too, didn't you?

517
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,779
It was you!

518
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,157
It was you, wasn't it?
You're the one!

519
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,825
You're saying

520
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,911
he sent a weird email,

521
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,788
then followed you around and molested you?

522
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,377
Well, actually what I'm saying, uh...

523
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,672
is that there's a good chance
this is the case.

524
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,883
All right, well,

525
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,594
why don't we just let this go?

526
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,973
You've both got places to be,
so don't let this get out of hand.

527
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,227
- Let's just try and move on, okay?
- How can I just "move on"?

528
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,772
This bastard touched me, I swear.

529
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,649
I can't move on.

530
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,903
Ma'am, you assaulted him, right?
We saw you.

531
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,456
Can't fucking believe this.

532
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,959
What a shitty fucking day.

533
