1
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,348
My name is Kyung-ja Kim.

2
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,267
Oh-nam Ju's mother,

3
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:18,977
Kyung-ja Kim.

4
00:01:54,781 --> 00:02:00,662
MASK GIRL

5
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,499
KYUNG-JA KIM

6
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,877
I grew up with nothing.

7
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,755
So I've always thought
dating was a luxury.

8
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,716
I met my husband through a matchmaker.

9
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,929
I didn't care about looks.
That never mattered to me.

10
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,765
He told me he had a steady job,

11
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,976
and that was enough for me to marry him.

12
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,354
Plus, he didn't seem
like the type to have an affair.

13
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,233
But even though he barely made any money,

14
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,652
that fucking bastard
shacked up with some bitch

15
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,112
right after we got married.

16
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,116
So, after just three years,
our marriage came to an end.

17
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,369
But do you know what?

18
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,163
I was okay.

19
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,999
Because I had my son, Oh-nam.

20
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,044
I could do everything and anything
because I had him.

21
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,850
Stand closer to the urinals.

22
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,602
Don't miss, y'all.

23
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,358
Hold it in.

24
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,820
H... Hold it in, hold it in, hold it in!
Get out!

25
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,072
Out, out, out, get out, come on.

26
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,574
Ugh.

27
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,827
What did you eat, buddy? Damn.

28
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,412
Sighs.

29
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,706
After working my fingers to the bone,

30
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,250
I was finally able
to open a small restaurant.

31
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,461
I have seats available,
this way, c'mon, let's go.

32
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,505
Cheonggukjang? Sure, I can make that.
Whatever, you name it.

33
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,843
Hey! Hey! Hey you! Wait... You think you're
the only one running a business here?

34
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,637
You just took the custom...

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,600
- I didn't drag them here, did I?
- Yeah, but...

36
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,515
If they don't like your food,
they eat mine.

37
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,018
If they don't like my food,
they can eat yours.

38
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,687
- So stop bitching about it for a second.
- How dare...

39
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,814
- Just a minute...
- You bitch!

40
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,610
I had no choice but to be like that,
so that I could put food on the table

41
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,111
and raise my child properly.

42
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,322
- Get off me!
- Hey, stop!

43
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,117
- Get your dirty hands off me!
- Ow! Let go!

44
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,411
But raising a kid
was harder than I thought.

45
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,790
When Oh-nam was little,

46
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,708
some of his things would go missing.

47
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,128
What do you mean, you lost it?
No way. I bought it two days ago.

48
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,923
He would sometimes come home with bruises.

49
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,049
What happened here?

50
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,343
I fell when I was playing.

51
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,971
Why are you
so clumsy and careless?

52
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,682
He even came home
with gum in his hair one day.

53
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,891
Oh my... What is this?

54
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,894
I don't even know
when it got stuck there.

55
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,814
Oh my goodness. Come with me!

56
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,315
Whenever something happened,

57
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,485
I would think, "Maybe I'm not
taking care of him well enough."

58
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,655
Even in pitch darkness,
may he learn to hear your voice!

59
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,906
Amen, Lord.

60
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,994
Oh Lord, may you be the light
that guides him through his sorrow.

61
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,537
Under your authority, Lord,

62
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,832
may he live a life of spreading your word
and praise with joy.

63
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,128
May sister Kyung-ja Kim's son, Oh-nam Ju,

64
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,629
receive your love

65
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,049
and be guided into the wonders
of the path you created for him.

66
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,133
Amen.

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,139
I don't know
if it's because God answered our prayers,

68
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,766
but it turned out
my son's grades were good.

69
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,103
Even though I couldn't send him
to a good private school.

70
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,647
Hey, Oh-nam, are you studying?

71
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:15,982
Yeah.

72
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,319
Good. Study hard.
You're going to medical school, my son.

73
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,665
C'mon, Mom,
I can do it myself.

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,668
Hey, wait. Are you embarrassed?

75
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,420
Hmm, baby?

76
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,173
My son is... all grown up now.

77
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,008
You're all grown up.

78
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,010
My son got accepted

79
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,971
into a four-year college in Seoul,
just like that.

80
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,932
It wasn't medical school,
like I wanted, but still.

81
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,768
Oh my God, my baby!

82
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,728
Would you look at that!

83
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,687
Oh, man!

84
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,106
You look so handsome.
So, so handsome, right?

85
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,608
- Don't you agree?
- Oh yes.

86
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,568
- Mom!
- He looks so handsome.

87
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,449
Then one day,
he suddenly wasn't my little boy anymore.

88
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,784
Once he got a job.

89
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,952
Is this the colonial era?!

90
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,205
What do you mean, "independence"?

91
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,955
Hey, listen.

92
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,710
Just because you're earning money
doesn't mean you should waste it.

93
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,172
You do know that
living by yourself's expensive, right?

94
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,469
You're not getting married or anything,
I mean, why would you wanna move out?

95
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,181
I just wanna live on my own.

96
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,853
You're saying,

97
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,607
you don't wanna live with me.

98
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,152
That's not it, no.

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,007
- It's just that I'm too far from work...
- "Far from work"? That's bullshit! C'mon!

100
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,742
It takes me two hours to get there
and two hours to get home.

101
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,119
That's...

102
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,913
Listen, when I was raising you,

103
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,543
I'd make my way to work through storms
or even typhoons, and I wouldn't complain.

104
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,838
You, on the other hand...
Four hours, really?

105
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,713
Oh my.

106
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,892
I thought that if I put my foot down,
he'd change his mind.

107
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,353
But he left anyway.

108
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,400
Not only did he leave,

109
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,486
he wouldn't even let me
anywhere near his house.

110
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,202
Oh-nam, my son,
I made some side dishes for you.

111
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,286
Are you home?

112
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,456
Mom, I told you
I didn't need any.

113
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,667
I don't even have time
to make food and eat at home these days.

114
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,751
You little punk!

115
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,253
Why are you like this, huh?

116
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,424
What, do I have to beg you
to eat these side dishes, huh?

117
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,093
This is not how I raised you, you get it?

118
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,303
This... This is just...

119
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,139
Mom, it's not like that.
I'm eating well, and I'm just...

120
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,433
Enough is enough, ungrateful jerk.

121
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,352
Wait, you know what?

122
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,855
You know what?
I'm never coming here ever again.

123
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,109
This time, let's just
cut ties for good, Oh-nam!

124
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,527
You... take care!

125
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,030
Damn rascal. I...

126
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,908
Damn it, damn it... Argh!

127
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,179
MY SON ♥

128
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,231
He only called once after that.

129
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,692
OHNAM RESTAURANT

130
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,779
Is that how you treat your mother?
You don't call me anymore?

131
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,949
I missed the call, okay?

132
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,576
Would it kill you to try calling me again?

133
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,663
You know what? Forget it.

134
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,834
Only one bottle today, okay?

135
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,720
So frustrating.
This is too much, too much.

136
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,722
That little punk.

137
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,559
How will he find someone?

138
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,602
Despite everything,

139
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,815
I had faith he would come back to me
to be the good son I know he is.

140
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,609
I never thought he would just disappear.

141
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,869
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Thank you.

142
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,706
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh-nam? Oh-nam!

143
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,417
Oh!
What's that smell?

144
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,712
What's that smell?
It smells rotten in here. Ugh!

145
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,675
Okay,
this is the bathroom.

146
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,218
Oh my God!

147
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,596
Have a look at this place.

148
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,972
Goodness.

149
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,976
Oh my! That's scary, uh?

150
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,811
Oh God, who is that?!

151
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,980
Hey, who are you?

152
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,066
It's a life-size doll.

153
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,987
Is that... not a... a person?

154
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,156
No, it's a doll.

155
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,865
A doll?

156
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,450
Yeah.

157
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,288
Oh boy.

158
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,498
What the hell?

159
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,711
It looks so much like a human.

160
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,963
That weird kid.

161
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,674
Why would he have
a doll on his bed like th...

162
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,259
Jesus, oh my goodness!

163
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,636
Damn it.

164
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,347
Huh? What's wrong?!

165
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,430
What is it?

166
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,227
Ugh!

167
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,939
Why are you
so surprised? Huh?

168
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,990
No! Not my son!

169
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,243
Oh-nam!

170
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,329
- My...
- No, don't touch it!

171
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,792
Oh! Ma'am? Ma'am!

172
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,419
Are you okay? Ma'am!

173
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,629
Officer Park!

174
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,381
Hey! Call an ambulance. Hurry!

175
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,716
- Yes, sir!
- Ma'am! Are you okay?

176
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,843
A dismembered body
has been found in the house

177
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,721
of a recently missing
office worker, Oh-nam Ju.

178
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,141
To identify the body,
an autopsy is being conducted.

179
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,978
Police are currently
investigating Ju's whereabouts,

180
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,439
who was last seen leaving work in October.

181
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,651
And also trying to find a connection
between Ju and the victim.

182
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,321
According to a police official,
the DNA analysis...

183
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,447
Um, excuse me.

184
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,367
Uh, which one of you is Ms. Kyung-ja Kim?

185
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,621
...as they are investigating,
all possibilities are open.

186
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,705
SEOUL YONGCHEON POLICE
YONG-JIN SEO / JONG-HUN CHOI

187
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,084
What are you saying right now?

188
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,838
- It's not my son?!
- Correct.

189
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,925
Oh my God!

190
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,137
Oh my God. It's not my son,
they're saying it's not my son.

191
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,347
- It's not my son!
- That's wonderful news.

192
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,182
- I'm so glad.
- Then who...

193
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,435
Who was in that, uh, black bag?

194
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,646
Well, at this moment,
we don't have enough to identify him.

195
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,189
We just know it's a man.

196
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,400
Well, that's fine.

197
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,360
As long as it's not my son.

198
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,570
Oh my God!

199
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,447
Oh, oh!

200
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,700
Uh, can, uh, can...
can you get me some water?

201
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,242
Water.

202
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,664
So, um, ma'am...

203
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,335
when was the, uh,
last time you talked to your son,

204
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,045
by the way?

205
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,758
About two weeks ago.

206
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,842
Take notes.

207
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,093
On my birthday.

208
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,720
- Oh.
- "Birthday."

209
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,599
Um, did your son
have problems with anybody, by chance?

210
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,601
Problems? What problems?

211
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,437
He always got along
with his co-workers and everyone.

212
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,731
Wait.

213
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,859
Why are you asking me about him?

214
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,488
Oh, well...

215
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,948
What is it?

216
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,117
Do you think

217
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,871
my son killed that man?
Is that what you think?!

218
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,249
Well, ma'am, there's a chance he did,
there's a chance he didn't.

219
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,710
- We just...
- You're fucking kidding me, c'mon!

220
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,754
My son's not the kind of person
to hurt anyone!

221
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,590
He pretty much faints
at the sight of blood!

222
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,718
How the hell
could you even think he'd kill someone?

223
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,054
Get lost, you jerks!

224
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,474
Later that day,
the police went to Oh-nam's workplace.

225
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,228
So I can't think of anyone
who was noticeably, uh,

226
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,522
or particularly close to Mr. Ju.

227
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,566
If there's anything I can say about him,

228
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,570
it's that, uh, when, um,
things didn't go his way,

229
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,447
he'd blow up, all of a sudden.

230
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,201
So that would, uh,
startle me every once in a while.

231
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,829
The last time I saw him
was when Mo-mi Kim quit.

232
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,665
He came to me
to get her address to deliver her things.

233
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,584
- Why did Ms. Mo-mi Kim quit?
- I don't really know.

234
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,963
She gave me
her resignation letter out of nowhere.

235
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,757
You're asking me if Mr. Ju liked Mo-mi?

236
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,511
Uh, you know what, I'm not really sure.

237
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,638
He wasn't a man of many words, you know?

238
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,099
Mo-mi did say something once.

239
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,395
Something like, how she felt
Mr. Ju was keeping an eye on her.

240
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,690
However,
I thought she was overreacting.

241
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,609
She does, um, overreact often, you know?

242
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,200
Oh dear, the things I go through.
Come on in.

243
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,995
The police searched Mo-mi Kim's place too.

244
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,205
She threw everything away before she left.

245
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,416
She said she was
going abroad or something.

246
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,962
Was there anything
unusual about her when she left?

247
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,464
- Unusual?
- Yeah.

248
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,013
Oh. Uh, she looked like
she got plastic surgery.

249
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,514
Plastic surgery?

250
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,309
Yeah. I mean,
you know how after plastic surgery,

251
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,728
they wrap the person's face
with white gauze?

252
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,104
Her face was like that.

253
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,773
At first I thought
someone beat her up or something,

254
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,275
I was thrown off, you know?

255
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,652
Was she

256
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,822
with a man, by any chance?

257
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,323
A man?

258
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,951
No. She lived alone.

259
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,913
I mean, did she ever come home
with a man before?

260
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,373
Nah, never, she never did.

261
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,043
Every once in a while
she'd put on really loud music

262
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,129
and sing and dance like crazy,
but nothing else.

263
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,675
All right. Thanks a lot.

264
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,970
- Are you done?
- Yes, we're done.

265
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,640
The police thought
that my Oh-nam and that girl

266
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,600
had run off somewhere together.

267
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,728
We have received information

268
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,439
that a colleague of Oh-nam Ju's
disappeared as well.

269
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,900
On the same night he went missing himself.

270
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,237
We went to her hometown,
Daesan, and tried to talk with her family.

271
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,824
Excuse me, when did you last speak
with Ms. Mo-mi Kim, your daughter?

272
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,412
The corpse was found
in a studio in Yongcheon-gu,

273
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,998
the home of the missing Oh-nam Ju.

274
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,504
There were over 2,000 illegal adult videos
saved on his computer.

275
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:08,384
A sex doll, as well as several adult toys,
were found at the scene of the crime.

276
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,428
His apartment was filled
with pornographic toys,

277
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,473
and that could point
to psychological issues.

278
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,642
Chances are his perception of sex
was abnormal.

279
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,521
The problem here is that the expression
of his desire

280
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,398
would become twisted

281
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,025
and found in the form
of stalking and obsession.

282
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,364
Hey, you piece of shit.
I told you to find my son,

283
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,159
but instead, you make him out
to be a pervert, stalker, and murderer?!

284
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,998
I should just shred all of you bastards
to pieces or something!

285
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,709
My son is a gentleman! He's a good person!

286
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,253
There's no fucking way

287
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,922
my baby did such a thing, you fuckers!

288
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,882
Damn you, bastards!

289
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,217
That's when I decided

290
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,928
that I have to find my son myself.

291
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,264
NEW BEGINNING

292
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,478
Does it work now?

293
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,147
Uh... Yes.

294
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,772
Thank you, mister.

295
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,738
Hello. What's this?

296
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,705
Uh, and what's this?

297
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,668
Where'd the pointer go? Huh?

298
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,503
Oh, damn it.

299
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,007
What the heck is all of this?

300
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,552
If I wanted to find my son,
I needed to know more about him.

301
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,554
So I started taking computer lessons.

302
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,099
Typing is one of the basics
of learning how to use a computer.

303
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,852
It's not easy
typing with both hands right off the bat,

304
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,313
so you'll learn to type
with each hand separat...

305
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,609
If you're having a hard time with it,
I would recommend practicing at home.

306
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,362
Today, we're going to look
at the basics of browsing the Internet.

307
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,615
If you look at the desktop screen,
there should be...

308
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,784
Today, we'll learn how to send an email.

309
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,662
So an email is basically like
a home address to receive electronic mail.

310
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,164
Your online home address!

311
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,584
MASK GIRL

312
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,669
FAN CAFÉ FOR MASK GIRL LOVERS

313
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:15,427
If I wanted to find my son,
I had to learn more about that girl.

314
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,930
HOT POST
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT MASK GIRL

315
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,227
HER REAL NAME IS MO-MI KIM
DAEHAN INSURANCE

316
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,603
Mo-mi Kim.

317
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,563
MASK GIRL AT A COMPANY DINNER

318
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,649
So she's a college graduate.

319
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,335
HANMI UNIVERSITY
CHEMISTRY DEPT WELCOME PARTY

320
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,277
OH SHIT, TOTAL UGGO
NO WONDER SHE WORE A MASK

321
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,238
"Uggo"?

322
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:38,325
"She's like an orc. A real-life orc."

323
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,828
Did they mean an orca?
But she's so skinny.

324
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,913
Damn it, I don't understand any of this.

325
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,208
To get any information from this,

326
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,169
I had to learn the words young people use.

327
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,963
KFM

328
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,758
KEEP FOR MYSELF

329
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,009
"No cap."

330
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,179
That means "not lying."

331
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,142
"S P O

332
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,309
N"

333
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,686
"Suddenly

334
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,939
Popping Out of Nowhere"

335
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Argh, damn it.

336
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,652
This is ridiculous.

337
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,735
CLOSED

338
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,366
What? Are you closing?

339
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,035
Oh, goodness.
Why would you SPON like that?

340
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,370
"SPON"?

341
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,247
Just forget it.

342
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,874
You're closing down?

343
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,085
- What will you do now?
- What else? I'm going to find my son.

344
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,766
Over the last few decades,
I've saved up a lot of money.

345
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,644
Will you be withdrawing it all?

346
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,439
Why? Is the bank low on cash?

347
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,940
No, it's not that.

348
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,906
There was another person who was looking
for that bitch as desperately as I was.

349
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,367
It was Teddy, the online fan café manager.

350
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,746
Mr. Manager,

351
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,123
hey, what's up, sport?

352
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,708
MG LOVE: HIYA-HI. TEDDY.

353
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,919
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: HAHA HELLO
GOOD 2 SEE U AGAIN

354
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,130
It's my daily check-in.

355
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,423
Teddy,

356
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,635
you have

357
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,969
worked hard.

358
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,388
Goodness, not like that, no.

359
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,099
Teddy,

360
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,643
I think

361
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,854
you're really diligent.

362
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,813
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: HAHA THX

363
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,440
Have you

364
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,107
found

365
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,442
anything,

366
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,654
uh, cool?

367
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,925
I FOUND SOMETHING FREAKING COOL

368
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,325
Oh, what is it, what is it?

369
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,867
Oh.

370
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,162
What is it?

371
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,598
I FOUND A WOMAN WHO I THINK IS MASK GIRL

372
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,801
BUT I'M NOT TOTALLY CERTAIN...

373
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,345
SO I HAVEN'T UPLOADED ANYTHING YET

374
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,305
TAKE A LOOK

375
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,272
Hi there, ladies and gentlemen.
Today, here at Gangcheon Plus Mart,

376
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,483
we are having a sale
to celebrate our third year since opening.

377
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,362
We'll be holding a big event
during the sales period. Come on in!

378
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,072
So that's

379
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,200
Mask Girl. You think so?

380
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,037
I can't really tell.
Her face looks totally different.

381
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,376
SHE PROBABLY GOT PLASTIC SURGERY

382
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,459
Plastic surgery?

383
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,822
BUT HOW SHE DANCES AND HER BODY
ARE SIMILAR TO MASK GIRL'S!

384
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,425
THE WOMAN IN THE BACK
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT PLUS MART

385
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,594
JINCHEON? GANGCHEON?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, LOL

386
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,616
SHOULDN'T WE CALL THE POLICE?

387
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,976
I DID. BUT THEY THOUGHT
IT WAS A PRANK CALL

388
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,228
The bastards, they're useless.

389
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,772
BUT I'M A BIT CONFUSED
HER BOOBS LOOK FAKE IN THE VIDEO

390
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,856
Her boobs?

391
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,985
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT SURE
CUZ MASK GIRL'S ARE ALL NATURAL

392
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,574
YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE?

393
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,243
OF COURSE HAHA
MY NICKNAME IS BOOB CONNOISSEUR

394
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,578
Oh my...

395
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,246
I TOLD U I BECAME MASK GIRL'S FAN

396
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,123
ALL BECAUSE OF HER BOOBS

397
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,791
SUCH PERFECT BOOBS ARE RARE

398
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,376
You pervert.

399
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,505
I guess I'm crazy for believing ya.

400
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,639
Mom?

401
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,061
Mom, wake up.

402
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,860
Oh my God.

403
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,613
Sweetie, are you here?

404
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,114
Where are you?

405
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,623
Mom?

406
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,294
Oh-nam!

407
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,378
Mom.

408
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,756
Mom, I'm so cold.

409
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,300
It's ok... It's okay, sweetie.

410
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,137
Get in here. Huh?

411
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,805
Come to me.

412
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,689
Sweetheart.

413
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,567
Where have you been, honey?

414
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,279
Where were you, sweetie?

415
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,991
I missed you so much, you have no idea.

416
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,454
Let me have a look...

417
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,498
...at your face, son.

418
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,365
Dear Lord...

419
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,584
No! No!

420
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,751
Lord!

421
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,131
Oh-nam, no!

422
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,135
My son!

423
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,357
It's all because of her.

424
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,902
It's her fault, she did this to him!

425
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,780
She turned my son into this, that whore!

426
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,747
Oh-nam... Oh-nam, no, no!

427
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,624
Ms. Kim.

428
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:06,087
- Ms. Kim.
- Oh no, no, no, no, no!

429
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,675
Why is this happening, Lord, dear Lord?!

430
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,721
Around 8 a.m. today,
a man's dismembered body was found

431
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,515
in a suitcase by a hiker.

432
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,308
The victim is Oh-nam Ju,

433
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,644
the missing person
and resident of the studio

434
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,855
where another dismembered corpse
was found five months ago.

435
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,900
The investigation is focused
on finding Mo-mi Kim,

436
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,736
who is presumed to be deeply involved
in the case.

437
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,489
My son

438
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,493
has never done anyone harm.

439
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,248
Even the thought
of killing a bug scared him.

440
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,292
He was such a kind person.

441
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,754
I've prayed.

442
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,510
"Lord, what have I done wrong

443
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,303
to deserve this punishment?"

444
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,767
"Why would you give me sorrow
that I cannot endure?"

445
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,895
"Is this truly your will, Lord?"

446
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,566
"If you give me such sorrow now,

447
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,610
how happy will you make me tomorrow?"

448
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,322
"What will you have me do

449
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,908
in your name on this earth, my Lord?"

450
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,663
Only then,

451
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,084
did I hear the voice of our Lord.

452
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,796
"Daughter,

453
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,259
my beloved daughter."

454
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,971
"Go your way."

455
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,934
"Even though you walk
through the valley of the shadow of death,

456
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,271
I will protect you,
and I will be with you always."

457
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,941
"No person will ever
be able to stand in your way!"

458
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,026
"You are mine."

459
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,777
"You're a soldier!"

460
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,072
Who is it?

461
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,114
Is this

462
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,576
that bitch Mo-mi Kim's house?

463
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
What?!

464
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,579
Sorry, who is this?

465
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,124
I'm the mother of the victim she murdered.

466
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,958
Open the door.

467
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,462
What the...

468
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,547
Hello?

469
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,178
Bunch of soulless assholes!

470
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,640
Open the door.

471
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,517
Open the door!

472
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,020
You guys call yourselves human, huh?

473
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,648
You're no better than animals!
Open the door!

474
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,274
Open it, now!

475
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,321
- You little bi...
- I am a housekeeper here, ma'am.

476
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,450
My employer says she'll call the cops
if you don't leave right now.

477
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,620
That little...

478
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,624
She should be out here
begging on her knees for my forgiveness.

479
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,960
Ma'am. Please.

480
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,921
Woman, does she know
her daughter's a murderer?

481
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,717
That hasn't been confirmed yet,
you know? And besides,

482
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:43,388
my employer cut ties
with her daughter a long time ago.

483
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,724
She doesn't know anything
about her daughter,

484
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,809
and she doesn't even care to know.

485
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,352
I'll tell you something else,

486
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,689
I didn't even know she had a daughter
until this incident happened.

487
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,815
Don't lie to me.

488
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,360
Tell me where to find her,
and I'll leave right now.

489
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,655
Oh dear, if I knew,
I would've told the police by now.

490
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,536
What the...

491
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
That...

492
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,375
You fucking slut! You look like an owl!

493
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,835
Come down here!

494
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,379
Oh my God, look at that cold bitch.

495
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,758
Even if she was begging for forgiveness,
I wouldn't be happy.

496
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,843
That damn bitch
is acting like she's above me.

497
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,344
How vulgar!

498
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,307
Where do you think
you're going, you bitch?!

499
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,227
Hey, ma'am! If you keep this up,
I'll have to call the cops, you hear me?

500
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,480
- Oh my God!
- You didn't call them yet?

501
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,397
Oh my God!

502
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,193
I'll call them myself! Come out right now,
you fucking bitch! Argh!

503
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,073
Ma'am, you came a long way.
Here, have some coffee.

504
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,157
Here.

505
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,080
The lady you harassed
said this time she'll let it go.

506
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,210
But she said she won't let it slide
if you ever decide to come back.

507
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,797
And the...

508
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,341
What about the father, was he not home?

509
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,884
Her husband?

510
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,305
He killed himself a long time ago.

511

IT'LL BE HARD TO FIND HER THEN

522
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,275
Amen.

523
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,572
Thank you for praying for my son.

524
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,698
Sure.

525
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,243
You know,
he was a pretty smart kid, Oh-nam.

526
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,329
He could've totally
gone to medical school,

527
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,625
but he threw a fit, saying he didn't like
the sight of blood, so he didn't want to.

528
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,460
He was a great son.

529
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,337
He really was the best son ever.

530
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,966
He would insist on sending me money
whenever I wanted to travel.

531
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,595
Plus, whenever I made him food,
he'd be so grateful.

532
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,222
Wow! It's hard
to find sons like him, you know?

533
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,017
- You're right.
- Mm-hmm.

534
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,853
And the girls
were all crazy about him.

535
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,106
Well, he was so polite and smart,
so of course they were.

536
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:44,027
But none of them were enough for him
in my eyes. If I knew this would happen,

537
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,363
I would've let him date anyone he liked.

538
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,615
- Oh, sweetie...
- Oh my!

539
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,745
- It's okay.
- Hey, it's okay. Don't cry. Oh.

540
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,997
Aw.

541
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,460
Oh, go ahead and eat.

542
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,253
- Go ahead, c'mon.
- That reminds me.

543
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,005
- Did you hear?
- Hmm?

544
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,592
That uh... That dentist over at Jeil Plaza,
have you heard?

545
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,095
Apparently, he's having an affair
with his nurse!

546
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:15,433
People who do perverted things like that
should really get a death penalty.

547
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,434
- I agree.
- You're right.

548
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,312
Wait, do you know
how they both got caught, though?

549
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,229
How?

550
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,900
The fortune-teller, Ms. Park,
mentioned it, do you remember that?

551
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,570
- Well, apparently, she foresaw it all.
- What?!

552
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,113
- What?
- She saw the husband.

553
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,907
And saw the mistress too.

554
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,908
- Oh my God!
- What?!

555
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,995
- A churchgoer going to a fortune-teller?
- Relax, that fortune-teller's different.

556
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,081
I've been there too, to tell the truth.

557
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,165
Hmm.

558
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,292
She's great. The real deal.

559
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,293
- Really?
- Yeah!

560
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,087
And... where is it?

561
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,546
- Huh?
- I might wanna go too.

562
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,256
Yeah! Let's go together.

563
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,716
Jesus, don't be ridiculous.

564
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,469
- The Lord is watching!
- You startled me!

565
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Hmm.

566
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,775
Hmmmm.

567
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,156
Jesus, you're making me anxious.

568
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,534
Can you not see where she is?

569
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,868
Hold on tight.

570
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,290
West.

571
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,627
She went west.

572
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,131
I would die of old age
looking for her through "the west."

573
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,134
I need you to give me her exact location.

574
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,222
Here. I'll give you
all the money you want.

575
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,613
Oh my Lord, please help me...

576
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,116
Please, dear God, help me.

577
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,955
It's here.

578
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,753
Wh... What's there? What is it?

579
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,964
I see a river.

580
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,551
And a piece of cloth.

581
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,180
Gangcheon.

582
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,264
Gangcheon?

583
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,769
- Mm-hmm.
- Gangcheon, are you sure about it?

584
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,023
This is it. This is the place.

585
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,279
She's the girl dancing outside.

586
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,655
Here.

587
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,577
I'm not sure who she is.
Maybe you should ask someone there.

588
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,164
- Sorry to bother, I just have a question.
- Oh, sure.

589
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,875
By any chance, do you know this girl?

590
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,295
Hmm. Uh, Won-ju, take a look.

591
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,300
Oh, this girl.
She promotes events for us.

592
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:58,012
- Is that so?
- But she hasn't been here in a while.

593
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,390
Well, is, uh... Is there something else
you could tell me? Like...

594
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,558
Like her number?

595
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,561
Uh... She is... She's my daughter.

596
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:09,023
I haven't seen her since she left home.
After completing high school.

597
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,401
Um, we have her agency's number, don't we?

598
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,404
Uh, give her that number, would you?

599
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,323
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- Uh, sure.

600
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,117
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

601
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,037
- I can sleep in peace now.
- Yep.

This bastard's

Guess it's one of those
lucky days for me.

608
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,440
Looking for somethin'?

609
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,777
Actually, I'm looking for someone.

610
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,861
Who?

611
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,031
I think you got the wrong place.

612
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,201
I heard this girl used to work here.

613
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,750
Ah... Yu-mi.

614
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,377
Yu-mi?

615
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,630
She quit, ma'am.

616
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,007
Really? Are you sure?

617
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,552
She said she was gonna
find a better-paying job, so she quit.

618
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,930
- Crazy chick.
- Did she say what kinda job?

619
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,266
What do you think a girl

620
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,436
with her face, body, and figure
would do to make good money?

621
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,147
Goddamn it! I fold.

622
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,577
No, I've never seen her.

623
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,829
Wait, just have
a better look at her, c'mon.

624
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,300
Uh, no, I've never seen her before.

- There you go, ma'am. Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

630
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,251
Mm-hmm. Welcome. What can I get you?

631
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,295
- Can I get some sliced soondae?
- Sure.

632
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,589
I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse.

633
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,011
Hello, sir.
Yes, I'll be right there.

634
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,263
Sure.

635
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,825
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

636
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,785
Sure thing, have a good one!

637
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,504
Just leave it.

Beer, three boxes of beer, dry snacks...
Yeah. Great.

640
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,336
- Take care of this.
- Yes, sir.

641
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,588
Hey, Chun-ja, c'mon.
I can see your panties!

642
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,884
You drank again yesterday, didn't you?
I told you not to drink!

643
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,302
Whoa, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am!

644
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,972
Who are you? You can't go in there!

645
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,891
Uh, you see, I...

646
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,227
I just saw my daughter.
She was walking that way.

647
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,065
- Your daughter?
- She, uh... She just walked in.

648
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,900
She... She was wearing a denim skirt

649
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,319
and long shoes
that come up to here, you know?

650
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,402
Denim?

651
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,782
- Ah, Mi-ae.
- "Mi-ae"?

652
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,619
Uh-huh. When she's out, I'll tell her
you came by. She's busy at the moment.

653
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,579
Not right now. Bye now. Here.

654
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,997
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- Huh?

655
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,415
Please don't tell her

656
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,334
that I came by, is that okay?

657
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:42,588
I... If she finds out I came here,
my... my daughter will be furious.

658
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,465
- You know her.
- Right.

659
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,093
How would she feel
knowing that her mom knows she works here?

660
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,678
- Okay, ma'am, I understand. Go now!
- Right.

661
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,596
Uh-huh. Go on.

662
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,391
- Not a word.
- Of course, not a word.

663
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,976
- Mi-ae.
- Yeah, Mi-ae, Mi-ae. Uh-huh.

664
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,272
Bye now, ma'am. Bye. Goodbye!

665
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,005
Hey! What are you doing?!

666
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,501
Mom! Save me, please!

667
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,381
Oh-nam!

668
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,470
Oh-nam!

669
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,980
Oh-nam!

670
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,114
Mom.

671
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,245
You didn't save me. Why didn't you, huh?

672
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,500
I'm sorry.

673
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,711
You were embarrassed of me, weren't you?

674
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,839
What are you saying?

675
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,261
I couldn't get into medical school,

676
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,223
and I never dated anyone,
so you were embarrassed of me!

677
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,933
You actually wanted me to die!

678
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,685
No! No!

679
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,521
That's not true.

680
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,857
You're glad I'm dead!

681
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,109
I'm sorry, son...

682
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,487
I'm sorry...

683
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Scuse me.

684
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,328
Are you all right?

685
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,706
Ma-am, hey!

686
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,697
You're always being judgmental. Hmm?

687
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,032
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

688
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,578
- How can I help you?
- I'm here to, uh, get my hair done.

689
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,373
Oh. Are you looking
for a specific hairdresser?

690
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,459
What dresser? Just do my hair.

691
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,797
- Yeah, so he went home, just like that.
- Oh my gosh, that's crazy.

692
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,424
Wow, he's such a jerk!
Like, just, wow!

693
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,427
He's gotta be crazy, I mean...
You know what?

694
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,346
I think that jerk is ghosting you.

695
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,264
I'm the crazy one.

696
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,684
He's so annoying!
Why did I ever agree to this?

697
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,727
Let's go wash your hair, shall we?

698
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,731
He said he was a genius,
and I totally fell for it. Damn it.

699
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,274
Oh, forget him.

700
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,278
Hello, ma'am. What look are you going for?

701
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,490
I, uh, wanna wash my hair first.

702
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,573
Sure.

703
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,327
Please have a seat over here.

704
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,540
Hold on just a sec.

705
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,798
All right, you can lie down, please.

706
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,888
I think I've seen that necklace before.

707
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,140
Where did I see it?

708
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,815
USB DEVICE RECOGNIZED

709
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,449
MASK GIRL

710
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,301
Found it.

711
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,763
I finally found it.

712
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,812
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY REQUESTS A 1:1 CHAT

713
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,939
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: MG LOVE,
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

714
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,357
What do you think?

715
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,321
MG LOVE: JUST SO-SO.

716
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,004
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: DON'T BE FREAKED OUT!

717
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,658
I'M IN GANGCHEON

718
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,743
Hm?

719
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,459
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: I'VE BEEN THINKING...

720
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,586
I THINK THAT WOMAN REALLY IS MASK GIRL!

721
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,879
MG LOVE: REALLY?

722
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,202
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY:
I WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET IN THE VIDEO

723
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,676
APPARENTLY, HER MOM

724
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,054
WAS LOOKING FOR HER IN GANGCHEON!

725
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,722
CONSIDERING ALL THAT

726
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,267
I THINK SHE'S REALLY MASK GIRL, BUT...

727
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,353
What does he think he is, a detective?

728
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,838
TAXICAB DRIVER'S LICENSE
KYUNG-JA KIM

729
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,949
Wow! You got this license
a long time ago, huh?

730
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,284
Are you sure you can handle it?

731
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,830
- Aren't you too old?
- Don't worry about it.

732
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,082
I know the gas and brake pedal.

733
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,526
I'm here to buy a gun.

734
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,571
You're the lady who called us?

735
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,366
Shit! Just my luck.

736
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,453
I heard it's three million won.

737
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,206
Here's ten million.

738
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:08,802
This one. This is a Glock.
Straight from Austria. Eh?

739
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,389
For a madam like you,
though, this is too, uh...

740
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,472
Forget that.

741
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,559
I want the most powerful one.

742
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,438
The most powerful one?

743
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,399
This one.

744
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,652
Hmm?

745
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,328
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

746
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,412
This is good enough.

747
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,549
In you go!

748
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,509
Oh, come on.

749
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,471
Get in the taxi behind me.
I'm not working tonight.

750
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:55,515
- Damn it. What the hell, seriously?!
- Come on!

751
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,267
Come on.

752
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,812
C'mon, let's go home.

753
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,859
VACANT

754
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,838
Uh, you must be exhausted
from working so late, huh?

755
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,966
Oh. Yeah.

756
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,301
You know, you look
about my daughter's age.

757
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,970
How old are you?

758
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,264
I'm 28.

759
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,642
Wow. You're the same age as her.

760
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,726
As my daughter.

761
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,647
Is that so?

762
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,204
Excuse me, miss.

763
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,250
My phone fell under the seat
in front you here.

764
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,168
Could you pick it up for me?

765
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,254
Yeah.

766
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,633
I can't find it.

767
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,136
- Is it not there?
- Where is it?

768
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,723
- I don't see it.
- Oh. It's right here. It's here.

769
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,057
What?

770
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,034
Awake, are you?

771
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,885
Somebody help! Help!

772
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,388
- Please, anyone! Help!
- Help, please!

773
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,183
Help!

774
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:54,319
What's the matter with you?
Why are you doing this? Who are you?

775
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,121
You don't know who I am?

776
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,081
I really don't.

777
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,584
I have no idea!
Why the hell are you doing this?

778
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:19,136
Wait, ma'am, ma'am.
Wait. Please, wait a minute.

779
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,304
I'm sorry.

780
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,891
I don't know what I did wrong,

781
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,769
but I'll do anything you want.

782
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,152
You're back to your senses, apparently.

783
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:45,954
Who is that person?

784
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,293
You don't know him?

785
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,421
You little...

786
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,797
Ma'am!

787
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,425
I don't know him, I swear to you!

788
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,970
I've never seen this man
in my life!

789
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,806
I do know who you are.

790
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,808
Your real name

791
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,685
is Mo-mi Kim.

792
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,896
Mo-mi Kim?

793
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,316
What do you mean?
I'm Chun-ae Kim! You're wrong!

794
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,860
"Chun-ae Kim," huh?

795
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,403
What a tacky name.

796
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,907
So how many names do you have?

797
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,159
Right...

798
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,953
Is this not you?

799
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,872
Yu-mi Choi?

800
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,541
How did you get this?

801
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,879
Do you still feel like lying?

802
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,924
- I'm telling the truth!
- You damn bitch!

803
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,347
Stay still or I'll stomp
all over your face.

804
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,605
Wh... What's the mask for?

805
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,441
Ma'am?

806
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,319
Why are you doing this?

807
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,488
It's really not me.

808
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,324
Please... Please don't do this.

809
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,744
I've never heard
of the name Mo-mi Kim before.

810
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,830
You lie
every time you open your mouth, you bitch.

811
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,749
Now that I see you like this,
I'm sure of it.

812
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,919
- It's really not me.
- It's you. It is you!

813
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,424
Ma'am, I'm telling you,
it's really not me.

814
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,972
Why are you doing this?

815
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,765
You wore that mask

816
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,768
when you killed my son, didn't you?

817
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:36,648
Ma'am, why would I kill your son?
It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!

818
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,317
I've never seen your son in my life,
I swear to God!

819
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,361
I've looked at your photos

820
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,030
as many times as I've looked at my son's.

821
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,952
The necklace you're wearing,

822
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,247
it's the same as the one in the picture.

823
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,166
Necklace?

824
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,687
Are you going crazy now, bitch?

825
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,279
I think...
I think I know who that girl is.

826
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,530
What?!

827
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,287
You said her name's Mo-mi Kim, didn't you?
