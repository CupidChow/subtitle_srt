1
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,460
Hey, Granny!

2
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,048
Oh my!
Why are you waiting outside? It's hot!

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,843
I bought some snacks
and new clothes for you.

4
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,180
- Let's go in. Are you hungry?
- Yes, I am.

5
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,784
- Why are you acting up again?
- Mo-mi, stop it!

6
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,496
That woman from earlier,
she'll commit murder.

7
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,331
This is your final warning!

8
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,042
If you do this again,
we'll be forced to take action.

9
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,753
Hey, c'mon. That's enough!

10
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,130
Please! Stop her!

11
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:12,734
MASK GIRL

12
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,906
MO-MI AND MI-MO

13
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,036
Wow. This jeotgal is really good.

14
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,873
I'm surprised
you like it. Kids usually don't.

15
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,002
You know, I stored it underground
for a long time.

16
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,880
Wow. "Underground"?
Maybe that's why it's good.

17
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,093
She... really said that to you?

18
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,222
Hmm.

19
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,018
Honey... don't worry about it.

20
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,854
I'll try to get some people
to look into that woman.

21
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,483
It might... take a little while
to find where she is,

22
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,902
so first I'll get information
on your mother and daughter,

23
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,363
and then I'll update you
as soon as I have news.

24
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,909
You should at least
give your grandmother a call, right?

25
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,327
My grandma's...

26
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,206
probably happy that I'm gone.

27
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,166
Grandmas don't think that.

28
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:15,338
Hmm? She must feel bad
because you left home and abandoned her.

29
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,467
If you want to stay with me,
then you need to call

30
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,094
and tell her you're all right.

31
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,640
Don't tell her
you're staying with me specifically.

32
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,685
Okay, fine.

33
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,768
Good.

34
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,401
And who is that?

35
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,738
Is that your son? In that picture?

36
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,033
Yes.

37
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,996
Oh, awesome. I didn't know you had a son.

38
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,209
He's not here anymore.

39
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,379
He's far away.

40
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,142
Ms. An told me
to give this to you.

41
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,070
YEONG-HUI SHIN
010-544-1942

42
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,328
MISSING PERSONS REPORT

43
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,164
By the way, I'm sorry to ask this,

44
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,500
but is this the first time she,
uh, has run away from home?

45
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,756
Oh, she's done it once or twice,
but, uh, she always comes back, so...

46
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,636
Well, uh, why don't you try
waiting for her a little longer?

47
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,847
There's a high chance she'll return soon.

48
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,348
Oh.

49
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,743
Oh.

50
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,246
Oh God! Mi-mo!

51
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,539
Where are you?

52
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,917
I'm doing all right.

53
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,669
So don't look for me.

54
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,220
- And don't report me as missing.
- But w... wait!

55
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,515
Living with me
is just a nuisance to you, anyway.

56
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,266
That is not true!

57
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,018
You said I made you uncomfortable

58
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,354
and reminded you of her.

59
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,649
The kids at school hate me too.

60
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,071
When I think about it, everything
will be fine if I just disappear, right?

61
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,406
Uh, but Mi-mo, wait.

62
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,825
Wh... What... What are you talking about?

63
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,118
I won't call you again.

64
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,079
W... Wait. Hello? Mi-mo...

65
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,789
GRANDMOTHER

66
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,872
POWER OFF

67
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,544
What?!

68
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,921
Uh... Uh... Hello?

69
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,047
It's Mo-mi.

70
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,760
How on earth...

71
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,138
Is Mi-mo doing well?

72
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,307
You're asking about Mi-mo after so long?

73
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,226
Mi-mo's fine!

74
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,018
Ma,

75
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,940
did Mi-mo ever mention a... an older woman?

76
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,401
A lady she... met at school?

77
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,484
No, she didn't.

78
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,572
I don't know how
you managed to get my number,

79
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,658
but if you care about Mi-mo,
then don't ever call me again.

80
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,201
Mom... listen!

81
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,453
Hello?

82
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,496
Hello?!

83
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,129
Number 1047,
your time is up. Come out.

84
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,299
Number 1047, come out now!

85
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,842
Come out right now.

86
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,677
Come out right now!

87
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,848
- Wait. I just need to make one more call.
- You can't! Come out right now!

88
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,726
- I need to make one more call!
- Get out of the booth right now!

89
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,104
- I just need to make one more!
- Out right now! Hold her!

90
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,900
Hold her down!
Don't move. Stay still. Stay still!

91
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,614
Honey... did you make a scene
in the phone room?

92
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,661
First, that incident
with the woman last time,

93
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,872
and now this one...

94
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,791
You know, I barely managed
to convince the warden not to...

95
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,251
not to put you in the hole?

96
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,044
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,006
She did say
they're restricting your access

98
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,925
to the phones for two weeks, though.

99
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Ah!

100
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,889
Also, I'm looking into that woman already.

101
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,266
She changed her name,
so it's taking me a while.

102
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,773
I found the...
school that Mi-mo is currently going to.

103
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,236
If you want, call and check for yourself.

104
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,489
I will put in a good word for you
with the chief warden.

105
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,990
One call should be fine.

106
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,701
Hello?

107
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,246
Hello, um,
is this Seongrim Middle School?

108
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,330
Yes, that's correct.

109
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,125
Okay, could I speak... with Mi-mo Kim?

110
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,005
She's a seventh grader.
I really need to tell her something.

111
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,841
Oh... One moment, please.

112
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,666
Hello?

113
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,298
Number 1047,
your time is up. Come out.

114
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,132
Hello?

115
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,516
The call disconnected.

116
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,559
Good job.

117
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,357
Bye! I'll see ya.

118
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,858
Uh-huh.

119
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,111
Mmm. Mmm!

120
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,905
Oh! The tomato is so good.

121
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,366
Crop harvest is good this year.

122
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,662
You know, I look for the sweeter ones,
and I put them aside just for you!

123
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,291
Aren't they tasty?
Have as much as you'd like.

124
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,376
We're so glad you're enjoying them, right?

125
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,046
Have some, have some! C'mon!

126
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,255
Go on, try some.

127
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,093
By the way,
why does Mask Girl look so miserable?

128
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,099
How was it? Could you reach the school?

129
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,184
Yeah.

130
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,811
Ma'am, um, do you think,

131
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:51,901
maybe I could get, you know,
some... pictures of Mi-mo going to school?

132
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,486
You want pictures?

133
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,236
Ah!

134
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,034
Just get a kid around her age,
in a school uniform,

135
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,244
and take a picture in front of the school.

136
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,041
Of course not,
she just has to look similar enough.

137
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,751
Not a mirror image of the girl.

138
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Listen,

139
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,299
this woman hasn't seen her girl for years,
she'll never tell them apart.

140
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,886
Oof.

141
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,724
Ah, Jesus. It's all crooked.

142
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,229
I think they took it
from a distance

143
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,606
'cause, um, getting too close
would be weird.

144
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,484
Thank you so much.

145
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,902
This makes me feel better.

146
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,614
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

147
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,952
You should feel relaxed.
After all, the surgery's tomorrow.

148
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,577
Isn't that right?

149
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,751
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
this is the lowest we can go.

150
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,879
Our prices are fixed,
so unfortunately, I'm really...

151
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,549
Hey, hey. I'm paying in cash.

152
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,051
So give me a discount.

153
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,553
Here.

154
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,889
Do we have a deal?

155
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,855
QUICK GRILL BRIQUETTE

156
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,817
How much is it?

157
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,237
- 9,700 won. Would you like a bag?
- No, it's fine.

158
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,823
Here. Put it here.

159
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,449
Mm-hmm.

160
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,434
Mi-mo!

161
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,018
I'm back!

162
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,773
Are you sleeping?

163
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,244
Shit.

164
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,060
- Whoo!
- Oh...

165
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,020
Is it my birthday?

166
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,730
I didn't know.

167
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,609
How did you know it's... today?

168
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,361
I saw your ID in a drawer.

169
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,406
- Granny?
- Huh?

170
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,409
- Blow the candle out.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh. Sure. Um...

171
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,332
Granny,

172
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,918
I consider you my real

173
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,919
grandmother.

174
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,507
So you have to live long.

175
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,721
Sure.

176
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,395
Number 1047, hospital transport.

177
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,567
I wish you the best of luck.

178
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,588
You look so different in that!

179
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,675
- Don't you think so? Huh?
- Mmm.

180
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,219
You know, I bought these for her.

181
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,886
Ah!

182
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,807
You look pretty in a skirt.

183
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,184
Right? Are you happy right now?

184
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,895
- Yes, I'm thankful for these clothes.
- Mmm.

185
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:07,067
Okay, so... no one outside of this facility
knows about the surgery.

186
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,778
So you'll have to behave
at the hospital, understood?

187
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,780
I understand, ma'am.

188
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,281
Very good.

189
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,660
God will be with you, Mo-mi.

190
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,506
If anything happens,
make sure to let us know.

191
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,590
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,305
You ready to go?

193
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,098
Yep.

194
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,208
Let's eat! Mi-mo, dear!

195
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,003
Wow! Granny, that's a lot of food.

196
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,340
Ah, I guess. There's a lot indeed.

197
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,716
- So eat up.
- Okay.

198
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
I think, um,

199
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,264
I should... get a job, you know?

200
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,390
You?

201
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,186
What do you need a job for?

202
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,107
Well, to, um... to send you on trips
and buy you clothes

203
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,733
and good food, of course.

204
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,402
I'll make sure
you live a long and happy life.

205
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,823
What's wrong?

206
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,120
Oh... nothing's wrong.
Oh, uh, eat your food.

207
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,997
Your soup's getting cold.

208
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,170
Mmm.

209
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,007
Wow. This soup is good.

210
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,268
- How may I help you, ma'am?
- I just wanted to ask you something.

211
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,436
Do you know that lady at our church,

212
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,814
the one who's close to Mi-mo
and sells tteokbokki?

213
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,274
Do you mean Ms. Nam?

214
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:14,695
Yes, her. Uh, would you mind,
uh, giving me her number?

215
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,406
Uh, and her address if you have it.

216
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,491
- Oh. Uh, well... Uh...
- Oh...

217
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,202
She came by my house
and prayed for us the other day,

218
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,621
so I wanted to send her a thank-you gift.

219
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,457
- Oh! I see. One moment, please.
- Oh sure.

220
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,129
We just got to the hospital.

221
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,841
Yeah. Uh, yes, ma'am.

222
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,760
Here you are, your hospital gown.

223
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,596
When is the surgery?

224
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,056
We'll begin as soon as
the blood test is complete.

225
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Okay, perfect.

226
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,948
Do you think I, um,
could get a Bible if that's okay?

227
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,991
A Bible?

228
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,662
The surgery's very serious.
Anything could happen.

229
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,249
I'll feel a lot better
holding a Bible right now, you know?

230
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,333
Do you mind?

231
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,548
Cuff her.

232
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,716
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,970
First we get your Bible,
then you change into your hospital gown.

234
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,526
I, uh...

235
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,864
I need the restroom right now.

236
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,117
Can you wait until she comes back?

237
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,370
It's pretty urgent.

238
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,039
She'll be back very soon. Just hold it.

239
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,333
I need to go now.

240
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,427
How do I use the bathroom like this?

241
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,012
You'll make it work.

242
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,807
This is a human rights violation.

243
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,437
I'm not here for myself, right?
I'm donating my kidney to her daughter.

244
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,605
This

245
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,275
is how you treat a donor?

246
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,777
I'm just following the rules. I'm sorry.

247
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,365
- Then I won't go through with it.
- What?

248
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,327
I don't wanna donate my kidney
if I'm going to be treated like this.

249
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,513
I don't think you can change your mind.

250
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,540
Call the warden,
and let her know I won't do it.

251
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,875
Eun-suk should know I refused as well.

252
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,728
23-7 HUISE-RI,
MAEMI-EUP, JINIL-GUN

253
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,382
You're...?

254
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,260
There's... something weird about that...

255
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,764
tteokbokki truck lady.

256
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,101
Get in.

257
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,230
Come on, get in. Get in.

258
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,317
Uh, "Jinil-gun."

259
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,611
Uh... Oh... Oh my, what does this say?

260
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,989
"23-7, Maemi-eup,
Huise-ri, Jinil-gun," sir.

261
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,745
So that lady knew
that Mi-mo is Mask Girl's daughter,

262
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,705
and she... told the entire school?

263
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,789
Yes!

264
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,043
I wanted to know
how the rumors started, so I asked around.

265
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,381
And everything led back to her,
the tteokbokki granny!

266
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:06,343
But then I remembered
that she was really fond of Mi-mo.

267
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,929
So why would she spread rumors, you know?

268
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,680
Something just feels off.

269
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,337
HOLY BIBLE

270
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,892
Oh my God! Oh my God, are you okay?

271
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,478
Shit!

272
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,562
Argh!

273
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,607
Goddamn it!

274
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,028
Hey! Hey! Stay right there!

275
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,029
Hey!

276
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,782
- Hey!
- Hey!

277
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,410
- Stay where you are! Let's go, c'mon!
- Let's go!

278
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,043
Oh! Oh God!

279
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,089
- Oh my God! Oh no!
- Horrible!

280
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,176
- Oh, ma'am, are you all right?
- Poor lady... Oh my...

281
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,219
Are you... Are you all right? Somebody...

282
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,848
Oh no! You can't just
run in front of me like that!

283
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,851
- We should go get a doctor.
- You really scared me. Jesus!

284
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,062
Wait! She's getting up.
She's standing. I can't...

285
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,691
- Let me help you into the hospital.
- Somebody get her some water.

286
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,153
- Oh my dear...
- Oh! I'll help you in there.

287
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,405
- C'mon, huh?
- Is she actually a patient here?

288
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,326
Hey, where are you going?

289
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,745
You should... You should go
to the hospital!

290
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,748
Huh? Where's she going? Ma'am!

291
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,960
C'mon. Th... This way...
No, no, no, no, no...

292
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,880
- Where's she going?
- What is she going?!

293
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,173
That's my car!

294
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,384
Hey, no! Oh my God.
My God! Where are you going?

295
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,552
Are you crazy?!

296
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,145
- What am I gonna do?
- Over here!

297
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,274
Oh no! My car!
She took my car! What am I gonna do?

298
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,901
She took my car!

299
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,945
Argh!

300
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,112
- What?
- What?!

301
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,740
- You goddamn idiot!
- You gotta be fuckin' kidding me!

302
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,576
Are your eyes on your face
just for decoration, you fuckin' idiot?

303
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,080
I'm gonna fuckin' pull your eyes out!

304
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,670
INCORRECT PATTERN

305
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,093
TRY AGAIN IN 28 SECONDS

306
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,735
Hello?

307
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,861
Don't hang up.

308
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,614
It's me, Mom, don't hang up.
Please, listen to me.

309
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,825
Mi-mo is in danger right now.

310
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,452
Mi-mo's in danger? What do you mean?

311
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,581
Oh-nam Ju's mom is trying to hurt Mi-mo.

312
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,666
Oh-nam Ju's mother?

313
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:29,588
That woman has been stalking Mi-mo
and just ruining her life this whole time.

314
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,924
So that woman is the mother of Oh-nam Ju?

315
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,638
Mom, do you know anything
about her that I don't?

316
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,141
Well, I...

317
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,810
I think Mi-mo's with that woman right now.

318
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,146
And actually, I'm on my way to see her.

319
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,231
You're on your way, right now?

320
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,441
Don't do that!

321
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,152
She's really dangerous.
Don't go face her alone.

322
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,903
Report her to the police first.

323
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:58,617
If you know her address or phone number,
give it to me right now. Please!

324
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,620
Uh... just a second.

325
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:08,585
It's "23-7 Maemi-eup,
Huise-ri, Jinil-gun."

326
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,422
Thank you so much, Mom.

327
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,054
JINIL-GUN

328
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,191
You, get out here now.

329
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,070
Wait, but I wanna go with you.
I have something to say to Mi-mo.

330
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,447
- Please? Please!
- I can't let you come along.

331
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,530
Get out of here.

332
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,788
Law Enforcement. What's your emergency?

333
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,040
Is this... Is this the police?

334
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,798
Taxi!

335
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,931
Sir, to 23-7 Maemi-eup,
Huise-ri, Jinil-gun.

336
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,233
HOW TO TURN ON THE CAMCORDER

337
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,316
Damn it.

338
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,820
Who can fucking read this?

339
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,375
Oh no. She's awake.

340
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,087
She's not supposed to be awake yet.

341
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:46,433
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm doing this.

342
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,894
Sorry, Mi-mo.

343
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,480
This is your mother's fault.

344
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,487
Do you know how my son died?

345
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,281
Your mother...

346
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,577
butchered him.

347
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,831
She cut him up into pieces.

348
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,378
I really didn't want it to come this far.

349
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,547
But you came to me.

350
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,633
So I went to see her,
and I wanted to tell her about it.

351
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,304
But she looked... she looked so peaceful.

352
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,973
She even had the audacity to

353
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,851
tell me that she found salvation.

354
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,396
Stupid lying slut.

355
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,065
How dare she speak

356
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,818
about salvation to me?

357
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,945
My whole life

358
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,364
was a living hell.

359
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,366
Granny!

360
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,036
I'll say it again.

361
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,247
You did nothing wrong.

362
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,499
Don't worry.

363
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,128
If you want to blame someone, blame her.

364
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,546
Your mother.

365
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,258
Okay, it's working.

366
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,765
I'm going to send
your last moments to your mother.

367
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,898
Oh... Oh my God! Oh my God,
your... your face. There's blood!

368
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,441
Uh... Are you all right?

369
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,362
Yes. Could you, um, maybe give me a ride
to Maemi-eup, if that's okay?

370
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,239
"Maemi-eup"?

371
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,742
But Maemi-eup is... the other way.

372
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,163
Uh, I... fought with my husband
and got out of the car.

373
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,666
I don't even know where I am right now.

374
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,752
If you could help me, I'd be so grateful.

375
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,462
Must've been a big fight, huh?

376
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:26,134
Ouch! Okay. Uh, you can get in. C'mon.

377
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,266
I fought with
my husband the other day too.

378
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,643
I was so angry
I almost jumped out of the moving car.

379
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:40,064
Ugh! I mean,
I should've gotten a divorce then.

380
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,066
"Think of the kids," I said to myself.

381
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,904
So I didn't divorce him,
but he still keeps ordering me around!

382
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,866
It's not like he makes that much money
to feel like such a big shot. You know?

383
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,079
Do you know what happened
when we had our first child?

384
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,956
He was nowhere to be found!

385
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,636
What?

386
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,970
Something to say?

387
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,572
What is it?

388
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,032
Granny,

389
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,992
I'm so cold.

390
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,130
- Here. Better now?
- Granny!

391
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm so sorry!

392
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,426
Please let me live.

393
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,848
Shouldn't have ripped it off.

394
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,896
Now what?

395
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,587
DESTINATION: MAEMI-EUP, JINIL-GUN

396
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,698
Finally, when we found him,
he was in the hospital,

397
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,116
sleeping in another room!

398
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,534
Ah, man!

399
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:18,538
Um, I'm sorry, uh, do you mind
if I check something on the navigation?

400
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,872
Oh, of course.

401
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,920
And then, when we had
our second child, you know what he did?

402
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,630
I got a C-section, and he just...

403
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,215
Breaking news.

404
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,051
This afternoon, the serial killer
known as Mask Girl

405
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,138
has managed to escape
while receiving hospital treatment.

406
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:39,517
She's a woman in her forties,
with short hair, around five foot five.

407
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,604
She was injured during her escape
and has a wound on her face.

408
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,649
If you see anyone
who matches this description,

409
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,110
please report it
to the police immediately.

410
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,832
- Hey.
- Yes?

411
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,420
Uh, I'll just get out here.
But thanks a lot for your help.

412
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,940
Is this the police?

413
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,280
Um, can I help you?

414
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,033
We got a call not long ago,
and the caller reported

415
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,118
a middle school girl locked in here, so...

416
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,746
Oh, my dear Lord.

417
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,081
But I live alone.

418
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,417
I'm sorry, but could I just have
a quick look around, if you don't mind?

419
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,378
I'm sure you understand. We got a call,
so we should check, you know?

420
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,510
- Mmm. Sure, but make it quick.
- I will.

421
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,431
Wow!

422
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,351
This...

423
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,521
Why would you have a rock
like this in your house?

424
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,982
Whoa, it's like there's actual power
emanating from it, huh?

425
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,818
Is this a real rock?

426
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,448
Wow, that is so interesting!

427
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,701
- All right. Well, let's take a look.
- Mmm.

428
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,372
Hmm.

429
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,129
What's over here?

430
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,384
Nah, it's the bathroom.

431
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,687
There's something here too.
What is it?

432
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,772
This is the kitchen.

433
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,399
Ohhh.

434
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,864
Huh?

435
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,616
This...

436
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,534
What?

437
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,289
This right here
should be in the fridge. Or it'll go bad.

438
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,583
Oh, just leave it. Come on out.

439
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,292
Hmm.

440
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,721
I guess it was just a prank call.

441
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,265
Yeah, you came here for nothing.

442
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,186
- Well...
- Well, God bless you.

443
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,437
Thank you. Bye.

444
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,317
It was just a prank call.
A damn prank call.

445
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,324
Somebody help me!

446
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,167
Hey. Did you just hear that?

447
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,501
What? Hear what?

448
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,591
I'll go check again.

449
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,179
Emergency.

450
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:07,391
Prison fugitive seen near Huise Mountain.
Requesting backup to Mount Huise.

451
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,019
Copy that.
Vehicle three'll be right there.

452
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,896
I should hurry up with this.

453
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,902
I'm soft. The problem is I'm too soft.

454
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,364
What goes around comes around.

455
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,452
This is a simple... and fair punishment.

456
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,997
Divine mission.

457
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,384
Uh, could you wait here, sir?
I'm just gonna get the child.

458
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,720
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry to get back.

459
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,432
- So you really can't wait?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

460
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,772
My beloved savior...

461
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,942
...he will hold me fast.

462
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,950
Mi-mo!

463
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,469
What the hell?

464
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,681
Why did you
break into my house like a damn thief?

465
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,771
What on earth did she do to deserve this?

466
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,774
What about...

467
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,193
What about my son?!

468
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,487
What did he do wrong?

469
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,571
Mi-mo!

470
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,241
- Granny!
- Who's this kid?

471
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,120
Mi-mo's in there!
Just go get her!

472
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,374
Where do you think you're...

473
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,168
Mi-mo!

474
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,007
Hey, Mi-mo!

475
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,762
Mi-mo, are you okay?

476
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,313
Mi-mo! Are you okay? Huh?

477
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,526
Mi-mo! Are you okay?

478
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,571
- How did you get here?
- I'm sorry, Mi-mo!

479
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,951
I'm really sorry for lying to you! I am.

480
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,745
I only did it because I like you. Oh...

481
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,001
I didn't... I didn't spread the rumors,
I swear I didn't.

482
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,836
I know.

483
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,880
I missed you so much!

484
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,341
I missed you.

485
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,179
- Wait, I'm...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

486
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,854
I can't untie it!
It's too tight!

487
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:31,405
Uh, what? Are you trying to be
a good grandmother now?

488
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,835
You're going to be punished
by the heavens.

489
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,216
You go and say that
to your daughter!

490
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,222
Die, you fucking bitch!

491
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,187
Mom!

492
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,607
Mom.

493
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:18,244
Mi-mo... Get Mi-mo first. Go!

494
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,788
Hurry! Go get her.

495
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,256
Uh, who are you? Who are you?!

496
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,050
Let's get out of this place first.

497
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,386
Help me.

498
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,683
Okay, get up.

499
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,280
Oh my!

500
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,408
Look who's here.

501
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,204
You came to me
by your own free will.

502
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,666
Oh my Lord!

503
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,421
You got sick of being alive, huh?

504
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,851
You had to...

505
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,355
go this far?

506
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,859
This

507
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,113
is all because of you.

508
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,628
You bitch!

509
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,479
Get out! Get out of here now! Go!

510
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,360
You bitch,
just die already!

511
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,954
Grandma!

512
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,167
Grandma!

513
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,756
Don't die!

514
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,344
It's okay.

515
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,428
Grandma...

516
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,514
I'm sorry.

517
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,726
I'm so sorry.

518
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,106
Grandma...

519
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,692
Mi-mo.

520
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,236
I'm...

521
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,283
I'm...

522
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,579
Grandma!

523
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,831
...sorry.

524
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,916
Grandma.

525
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,084
Mi-mo.

526
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,547
Grandma.

527
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,424
Grandma!

528
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,552
Grandma! Grandma!

529
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,226
Grandma. Grandma.

530
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,645
Grandma!

531
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,156
It ends right here.

532
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,949
You fucking...

533
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,630
You wanna end this?

534
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,382
It already ended

535
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,426
when my son died.

536
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,428
Oh, for... crying out loud.

537
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,327
Mo-mi Kim.
Put your hands up.

538
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,329
It's over.

539
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,811
Who's that old lady?

540
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,983
Oh my.

541
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,654
The Lord ha...

542
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,615
The Lord has sent me his army.

543
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,539
Hey. That's not a gun, is it?

544
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,875
It's a gun! She has a gun!

545
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,668
Ma'am, put the gun down!

546
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,254
Now! Put the gun down!

547
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:54,051
Only if you... do it first, you bastard!

548
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,094
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

549
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,221
Put the gun down now!

550
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,724
If you don't, we will be forced to shoot.

551
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,807
Ma'am!

552
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,894
You...

553
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,145
This is your last warning!

554
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,773
- ...feel exactly what I felt, bitch.
- Put the gun down!

555
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,483
Ma'am!

556
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,611
- Put your gun down!
- Feel my pain.

557
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:15,946
No!

558
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,406
No!

559
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,700
Mi-mo!

560
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,577
Mi-mo Kim!

561
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,545
- Where did you get that?
- Oh, I bought a used one.

562
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,798
- Did you sell something to afford it?
- Of course not!

563
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,758
I bought it with my own money, okay?

564
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,634
Shall we?

565
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,857
Since that day,
so much has changed.

566
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,154
Ye-chun's parents
became my temporary guardians.

567
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,364
And I went back to school.

568
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,661
The hate I felt towards other people...

569
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,538
I don't feel that anymore.

570
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Also,

571
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,671
that woman who used to appear
in my dreams...

572
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,300
she never appeared again.

573
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,254

00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,450
Yeah! Ms. Mo-mi Kim, what's your dream?

578
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:29,992
My dream?

579
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,329
Uh, I...

580
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:39,544
I wanna become a person
