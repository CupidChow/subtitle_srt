2
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,630
I see

3
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,760
The person who operates the game behind this

4
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,550
Ye niantang

5
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,590
The reason why he held the top position of Wen Liang

6
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,680
It is to promote the instruments he has studied for many years.

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,360
Now the reason why Hui knows Wen Liang

8
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,830
Because his adoptive father is Ye niantang

9
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,080
Teacher Wen knows me very well

10
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,440
Understand my past

11
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,230
Understand my fear

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,950
You work for Ye Jicheng

13
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,760
Help him complete his revenge plan

14
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,870
You get close to me

15
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,750
Close to my mother

16
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,750
Replace Professor Ji

17
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,600
You agree with your father's training model

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,080
Isn't it

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
I told you to stop

20
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,600
What about you

21
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,360
What you call benevolence

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,670
Is there no cheating

23
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,550
When you help visitors

24
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,600
Your Heart

25
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,520
There is no flash

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,550
He Jun shadow?

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,800
Sister

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,750
Can you really cure me

29
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,750
I think

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,880
I am very abnormal

31
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,390
Sorry, Mr. He

32
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,440
I don't think I'm ready yet

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,470
I feel that I am terminally ill

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Mr. He, I think

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,030
I think my life

36
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,750
It's going to collapse

37
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,030
No one can help me

38
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,160
I have no future

39
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,800
Because being hated

40
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,110
Will be isolated

41
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,020
Don't touch me

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,630
I think this moment

43
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,320
I can understand you

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,520
I know you too

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
Why do you feel lonely

46
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,670
Do you still want

47
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,960
Because from small to large

48
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,910
No one

49
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,000
Stand by your side

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,600
We can control

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Your own behavior

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,880
But sometimes

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,000
But we have no choice

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,190
Face the real self

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,600
Every family

56
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,880
All have their own problems

57
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,830
And we have one day sooner or later

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,270
From that protective case

59
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,000
Drill out

60
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,520
If you want to be a

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,390
More brave people

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,910
You want to protect others

63
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,160
First of all, you have to do it

64
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,880
Is to protect yourself

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,600
No one

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,830
Can deny you before

67
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,960
Pain experienced

68
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,390
No one

69
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,000
You can be denied because of this

70
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,270
In this world

71
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,080
Everyone

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
They are all independent individuals.

73
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,190
You have to trust yourself

74
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,750
You are not alone

75
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,320
You are for yourself today

76
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,600
Everything done

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,440
She can feel it in the past

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,600
Let her have more confidence to face the future

79
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,110
Thank you, Mr. Xiao He

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,270
I feel much more comfortable

81
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,550
Teacher He

82
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you for helping me

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,320
Teacher He

84
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,920
Thank you

85
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,550
Let me regain my courage

86
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,200
Teacher He

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,550
Listen to You

88
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,160
I am full of fighting spirit now

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,320
Teacher He

90
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,230
Thank you in my heart

91
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,880
Thank you, Mr. He

92
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,550
Your support

93
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,720
It's really important to me

94
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,880
You're right

95
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,640
The reason why I became a female psychologist

96
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,110
For my brother

97
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,390
In order to smooth my inner trauma

98
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,550
More

99
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,640
My brother's words

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,670
I want to be a doctor

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,440
Then invent a medicine

102
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,200
After people take this medicine

103
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,160
Will be very happy

104
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,110
Very happy

105
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,510
I really want to love this world

106
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,510
I admit that I am very guilty

107
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,160
When I get cured

108
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,200
When a visitor

109
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,440
The pain of my brother's death

110
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,230
It will appear more before my eyes

111
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,160
More than once

112
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,350
Asking myself

113
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,200
Can I really

114
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,200
Can I do it well

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,950
Am I objective

116
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,200
But Mr. Wen, I want to ask you

117
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,040
In this world

118
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,720
Is there really

119
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,950
A person without any injury

120
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Every one of us

121
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,670
Neither of them is holy

122
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,920
We all have our own

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,880
Private

124
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,160
But I don't think it's a shame

125
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,510
Because we are alone

126
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,040
As a person

127
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,550
We will have

128
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,720
Our psychological needs

129
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,390
Frankly Speaking

130
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,110
Save others

131
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
I am just for my own selfish desire

132
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,040
Because I started from

133
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,160
Save them

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,350
Can achieve their own growth

135
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,070
With strength

136
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,880
You and I think differently

137
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,390
I love my brother very much

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,830
I am also very concerned

139
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,950
Every visitor

140
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,510
I didn't take good care of you

141
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,070
Neither of us is perfect

142
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,350
It doesn't matter, Xiao Mo

143
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,110
I admit it

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm learning

145
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,510
Their power

146
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,320
This makes me grow up

147
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,440
But what I did

148
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,390
It's all meaningful

149
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,390
I am needed

150
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,640
I once blamed you

151
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,390
I don't think you told me

152
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,350
Just give it to my mother

153
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,480
Psychological Construction

154
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,550
But also through this time

155
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,320
I just found out

156
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,000
My mother

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,950
Went to my brother's tomb

158
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,350
As a daughter

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
I don't know about it

160
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,160
Is it good or bad for my mother

161
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,950
But as a

162
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,230
For psychological consultants

163
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,640
Our whole family has experienced loss

164
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,270
But did not deal with mourning well

165
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,640
This is the pain of our whole family

166
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,600
A core issue

167
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,720
From this perspective

168
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,790
I want to thank you more

169
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:10,880
Teacher Wen

170
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,790
Don't erase it on purpose

171
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,390
Your nature and kindness

172
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,230
If you really want to hurt me

173
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,320
If you really want to violate

174
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,350
The moral bottom line of being a psychologist

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,110
When you were my supervisor

176
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,160
You can disturb me

177
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
You can influence me

178
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,600
You can even leak it

179
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,640
My Visitor Information

180
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,670
To hurt my mother

181
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,320
But you didn't do all this

182
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,270
Please don't deny yourself

183
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,270
You are needed

184
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,350
Do you really think

185
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,320
I am needed

186
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,830
Of course

187
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,830
So I said

188
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,350
We share the same goals

189
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Let's do something together

190
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,830
Something meaningful

191
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,670
Teacher Wen

192
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,110
This time

193
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,200
It doesn't have any purpose, does it?

194
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,790
A person who knows the times

195
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,040
Ship-back steering

196
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,760
Take it easy

197
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,150
Happy point

198
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,080
Keep smiling

199
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,640
Come on

200
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:51,960
Come on

201
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,710
Go

202
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,670
Mom

203
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,840
Here we go

204
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Aunt, good aunt, good aunt

205
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,640
OK

206
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,280
Good aunt

207
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,670
I heard it

208
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,960
Such a big person standing here

209
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,910
Do you think your mother is blind

210
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Tell me about this TV

211
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,440
No wireless network

212
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,200
Just one table

213
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,110
Play over and over again

214
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,520
I can play it all

215
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,760
Aunt

216
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,910
Let me install a wireless network for you

217
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,200
No need

218
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,280
Auntie, it's time for dinner

219
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,230
Let's treat you to dinner

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,400
No

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,150
How many dishes can we order next door?

222
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,080
Just Eat here

223
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,000
I have to see the store

224
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,590
Right

225
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,760
What about our family's conditions? That's it

226
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,670
If you feel uncomfortable

227
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,840
Sorry

228
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,080
Mom

229
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,080
Take the gunpowder

230
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
They didn't say anything

231
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,710
I didn't say anything

232
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,710
Besides

233
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,020
Our environment is like this

234
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,080
It's not enough

235
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,350
Aunt

236
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,470
I came back from a business trip

237
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,280
Beef brought for you

238
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,230
Try it

239
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,470
This

240
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,080
Mention this beef

241
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,400
I think of my little uncle

242
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,640
You said the family was poor at that time

243
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,590
The little uncle made a long distance call

244
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,640
Also got a gastroptosis

245
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,670
You can't eat anything

246
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,200
I can't do it now

247
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,550
What about your aunt

248
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,960
She always borrows money from me

249
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,590
The money for playing mahjong

250
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,440
All transferred to her

251
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,640
I don't have any now

252
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,640
Mom

253
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,710
They just say a beef

254
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,470
Do you say so much

255
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,470
Besides

256
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,150
My aunt didn't take the money

257
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,590
Have you returned it?

258
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,150
Not so good

259
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,550
You are not happy with your relatives

260
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,280
Do you think

261
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,080
Mention your relatives

262
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,000
What a shame on you

263
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,710
You know I didn't mean that

264
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,640
Why are you looking for me

265
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,640
Lily

266
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,640
I think aunt said very well

267
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,960
Aunt, listen

268
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,150
Is a kind and righteous

269
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,230
A person with a knife, mouth and tofu heart

270
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you think so

271
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,880
Isn't it

272
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,520
Let's talk about our card players

273
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,030
If their relatives have something to do

274
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,150
They will never take care of it

275
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,760
Although I have a bad temper

276
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,350
But I am particular about it

277
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:16,960
Pay attention

278
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,150
Right

279
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,760
That

280
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,790
Thank you for your beef

281
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,030
That

282
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,030
Drink it

283
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,200
Thank you, aunt

284
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,550
Aunt is not afraid of your jokes

285
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,840
I have always had a small dream

286
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,960
Own one

287
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,320
Your own canteen

288
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,470
Inside

289
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,710
A wide variety of snacks

290
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,200
Feel like meeting you

291
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,520
Dreams are getting closer

292
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,400
I don't know

293
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,230
Can you help me

294
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,200
Work

295
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,640
Can you help me

296
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,640
But I don't have any money

297
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,520
Aunt me

298
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,590
I don't want wages

299
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,760
The dirty work here is tiring

300
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,320
I 've got it all

301
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,080
In addition

302
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,230
I will install the wireless network for you

303
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,150
In this way, we won't rub the net

304
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,150
OK

305
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,150
As long as she has no problem

306
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,150
I can do it

307
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,200
Look at my mood

308
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:11,670
Drink

309
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,670
This time we are

310
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,440
Cooperate with the third Municipal Hospital

311
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,350
From 30 applicants

312
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,230
Five selected

313
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,880
To act

314
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,400
Visitors from our group consultation

315
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,110
Although their illness

316
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,640
It is different from the illness stage.

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,350
But they have something in common

318
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,080
Psychological problems

319
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,320
Hope to pass

320
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,080
This consultation

321
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,670
Can help them understand themselves better

322
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,470
And learn to get along with diseases

323
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,110
Understood

324
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,350
Teacher Wen

325
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,400
If I have any aspects

326
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,960
Not doing well

327
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,790
You need to give more advice

328
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,470
OK

329
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,710
Then let's get started

330
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,400
Hello everyone

331
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,590
I am your consultant Wen Liang

332
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,230

It's my first time to meet everyone

335
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,470
Then let's get started

336
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,840
First of all, do you want to introduce yourself

337
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,000
Who starts first

338
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,710
I don't know where to start this

339
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,710
From your own

340
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,790
Speaking of physical condition

341
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,760
Why don't you come first, Aunt Zhang

342
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,320
My name is Zhang Xiaolan

343

Visitors who belong to monopoly speeches

351
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,320
I'm here

352
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,590
Because I have liver cancer

353
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,790
Liver transplantation

354
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,590
My son provided me with liver source

355
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,840
But

356
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,110
The couple quarreled two days ago.

357
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
He is not willing

358
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,640
I am not happy

359
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,470
Don't do it

360
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,790
This is also good

361
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,470
You don't have to suffer

362
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,760
But the doctor told me

363
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,400
I'm going to do a transplant

364
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,760
My chances of recovery are very high

365
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
My son is a coward

366
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,880
I pee on the floor

367
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,590
Pull him up

368
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,320
Aunt Zhang

369
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,230
I miss you

370
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,320

Have a preliminary understanding

372
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,110
Why don't you meet everyone first?

373
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,280
Then listen

374
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,140
What do you think of you

375
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,590
OK

376
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,400
What do you think

377
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,880
Aunt Zhang, please sit down

378
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
In fact, we are sharing

379
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,150
When telling your own story

380
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,200
You can sit there

381
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,110
Not necessarily stand up

382
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,350
OK

383
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:18,910
Who else

384
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,030
I would like to introduce myself

385
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,840

Visitors with negative emotions

398
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,280
The doctor said

399
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,030
When I get well

400
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,350
You can have an operation

401
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Little girl

402
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,470

Its probability is only 1/100

408
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,150
What can be done now

409
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
Just adjust your mind

410
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,030
Wait quietly

I said kid

420
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,230
You are late, don't you explain

421
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,230
There must be a reason

422
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,710
It will be fine if people come

423
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,000

Maybe it is a breakthrough for him

444
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,350
Generally speaking

445
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,880
The consultant needs to stop

446
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,640
The incessant chatter of monopoly speakers

447
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,320
Can face visitors

Monopoly speaker

450
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,710
Maybe faster

451
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,710
Accelerate his exposure

452
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,320
What's the smell on you

453

Bone cancer

462
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,030
The doctor said

463
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,110
Both legs must be cut off

464
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,950
I didn't want to come here

465
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,070
My family insisted on sending me here

466
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,400
Anyway, it's going to be amputated

467
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,950
What's the point here

468
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,160
What's the point?

469
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,310
I also advise you

470
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,430
Face the reality earlier

471
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,000
Xiao He, right?

472
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,590
I have to say a few words

473
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,350
Don't be unhappy

474
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,680
Now that I'm here

475
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,350
Just listen to the two teachers

476
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,000
I am the daughter-in-law of my son

477
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Hard to pull

478
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,160
We need to be calm

479
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:29,830
Here are all

480
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,880
I have a serious illness

481
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,760
Can you take care of yourself first

482
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,040
Don't be angry

483
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,040
You don't want dogs to bite Lv Dongbin

484
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,880
I don't know good people

485
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,640
What are you talking about

486
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,760
Let's not be so serious, OK

487
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,880
We are not feeling well

488
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,920
Some emotions are also very normal

489
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,710
Sister Yu

490
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,280
Do you want to make an introduction

491
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,640
My name is Yu Guifang

492
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,400
Recently, I suddenly found cervical cancer

493
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,350
In recent years

494
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,950
I have been working hard

495
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,110
Want children

496
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,430
But now

497
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,040
It's time to remove the uterus

498
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,230
So recent emotions

499
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,190
Always Low

500
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,280
Today is also a hope

501
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,880
Can get two

502
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,070
Consult the teacher for help

503
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,590
I am a

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,070
Nurses working in hospitals

505
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,110
So at ordinary times

506
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,230
Frequently accessible

507
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,190
All kinds of patients

508
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,280
See you today

509
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,800
I can't help it

510
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,760
I asked some questions

511
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,160
Don't think too much

512
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,760
Nurse Yu, look at me

513
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,830
I misunderstood you

514
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,590
Don't be as knowledgeable as me

515
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,680
It's okay

516
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,280
Sister Yu just mentioned one

517
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Very important words

518
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,110
I don't know, everyone

519
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,590
Have you noticed

520
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,310
Emotion

521
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,350
What you said is very good

522
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,800
In the days to come

523
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,280
We can sit here

524
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,160
Share and discuss emotions together

525
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,920
It will be one

526
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,830
Very important

527
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,590
But now

528
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,470
First of all, I have a question

529
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,280
I want to ask you

530
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,880
If you are sick

531
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,350
Understanding of this matter

532
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,880
We divide it into four stages

533
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,070
One

534
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,110
Shocked

535
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,190
I don't believe I'm sick

536
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,000
Anger

537
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,920
Don't accept your illness

538
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,560
Third Depression

539
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,950
Accepted his illness

540
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,560
This fact

541
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,710
But the heart is full of indignation

542
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,280
4. Acceptance

543
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,430
Completely accept and face calmly

544
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,710
These stages

545
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,310
Will appear in different order

546
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,040
But it may be repeatedly superimposed

547
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,160
Which stage are you?

548
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,950
The fourth stage

549
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,040
How to say

550
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,760
You

551
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,470
Do you believe in miracles?

552
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,350
I believe in miracles

553
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,400
Since I was born

554
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,470
He was diagnosed with leukemia

555
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
The doctor said

556
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,350
I can only live to be 16 years old at most

557
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,760
But you see

558
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,520
I am 17 years old now

559
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,760
I want to support it again

560
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
If you can live another year

561
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
I will take the college entrance examination next year.

562
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,310
If it can be longer

563
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,310
I want to go to the northeast

564
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,880
Take a look at what snowflakes look like

565
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,760
Xuehao

566
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,760
My second uncle lives in the Northeast

567
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,040
In Winter

568
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,800
The snow is so thick

569
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,000
Can pile a lot of snowmen

570
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,830
Yes

571
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,680
Where are the others

572
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,640
Do you want to talk about it

573
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,280
I think I am the third stage

574
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,230
I can't totally accept it yet

575
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,190
Such a situation

576
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,710
Not having children for me

577
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,950
This is really a big blow

578
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,310
I just think it's too unfair

579
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,000
What's good about having children

580
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,350
Children are raised for others

581
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,950
It is useless

582
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,830
I do have a son

583
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,680
Married and gave birth to a baby

584
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,560
Have your own home

585
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,400
Take me as a burden

586
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,950
People, think carefully

587
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,920
Still have to live for yourself

588
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,800
Around the children all my life

589
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,880
You are sick

590
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,880
Children don't need it

591
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,470
Just her temper

592
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,350
It is strange that her son can be filial to her

593
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,520
You are not filial

594
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,400
Who do you think is not filial

595
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Look, you treat us elders

596
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,190
Attitude

597
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,400
How good can your parents be

598
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,310
Do you see that I am not filial

599
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,230
Sorry, yes

600
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,560
I want to interrupt you two

601
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,040
Actually

602
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,430
We all have anger

603
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,680
With discontent

604
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,590
But we need

605
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,230
In an appropriate way

606
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,470
Express emotions

607
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,040
Try to avoid personal attacks

608
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,400
OK

609
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,430
Aunt Zhang

610
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,000
You can continue to say

611
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,830
Can you calm down

612
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,350
My son won't give it to me

613
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,400
I feel uncomfortable

614
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,280
He gave it to me

615
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,640
I'm not feeling well

616
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,310
Where is my son's liver?

617
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,310
How can I have it

618
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,880
Which mother in the world

619
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,710
To continue his life with his son's liver

620
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,040
Aunt Zhang

621
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,110
Please calm down a little bit

622
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,880
Zhao Laobo

623
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,230
I think you seem

624
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,190
Have something to say

625
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,560
Where is she

626
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,760
Just talk

627
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,430
Maybe in my heart

628
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,310
Afraid of death

629
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,760
Aunt Zhang is very painful

630
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,640
She was worried about her son

631
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,430
On one hand, he endured the pain alone.

632
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,560
Is the Loneliest

633
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,880
Aunt Zhang

634
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,920
Do you think everyone

635
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,830
Do you understand

636
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,430
In the words of the nurse

637
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,760
Speaking of my heart

638
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,070
Aunt Zhang, please take your time

639
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,400
Where are the others

640
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,230
Is there anyone else

641
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,280
Willing to share emotions

642
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,160
He Tao seems to be

643
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,230
I haven't said anything

644
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,070
Would you like to share

645
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,640
It's OK

646
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,920
Don't say it if you don't want

647
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,160
The rest of us

648
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,400
Does anyone want to share it for him

649
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,160
Anger

650
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,070
He is unwilling to accept his illness

651
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Yes, yes, he doesn't accept it

652
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,880
He also lost his temper and cursed

653
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,640
Sick and angry

654
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,590
Isn't it normal

655
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,800
Why must I accept it

656
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,160
I just don't accept it. Why

657
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm just angry. What's wrong

658
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,000
You have children here

659
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,640
If your own children

660
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,590
Only twenty years old

661
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,880
Your legs will be cut off

662
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,000
You can still be like this

663
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,680
Indifferent

664
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,950
Too much

665
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,310
You 've gone too far

666
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,950
How can you say uncles and aunts

667
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,760
Is it indifferent

668
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,880
Everyone has pain

669
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,230
You are not the only one suffering

670
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,110
People just care about you

671
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,830
I hope you can be happy

672
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,520
I'm not here for fun

673
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,590
Then what are you doing here

674
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,830
What do you wear

675
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,520
I'm here

676
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,800
My parents forced me to come here

677
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,190
What are you doing here

678
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,680
You are not trying to please them

679
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,760
Say something nice

680
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,560
That's not what I mean.

681
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,430
I think

682
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,710
If everyone is happy

683
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,760
Happy

684
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,950
Is happiness so important

685
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,070
Can happiness make me stand up again

686
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,920
Can happiness cure your disease

687
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,710
You come here

688
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,760
Is it pretending to be happy?

689
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,160
Do you know

690
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,190
The kind on your face

691
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,350
Pretend to be happy

692
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,430
It makes me feel sick

693
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,310
Shut up

694
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,590
Do you think so too

695
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,110
What do you think

696
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,680
What should I do

697
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,590
I should have burst into tears

698
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,400
Complaining about the unfairness of life to me

699
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,190
Just because I'm sick

700
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,680
Can't I laugh

701
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,950
In your eyes

702
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,110
I am just like you

703
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,880
I am qualified

704
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,950
As a patient

705
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,680
In your eyes

706
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,640
I just deserve to cry

707
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,190
Have you finished the rest of your life?

708
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
You asked us to check

709
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,520
The address on Anna's letter

710
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,070
It's fake

711
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,800
Fake

712
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,070
That means

713
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,280
Or it is a

714
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,310
Fictional story

715
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,830
Or the sender is unwilling

716
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,160
Reveal her true identity

717
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,830
I think no matter what

718
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
This story is good

719
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,310
It doesn't affect us

720
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,110
The writer

721
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,710
The writing is quite good

722
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,470
What's wrong with you

723
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Are you worried

724
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,950
We received it unexpectedly

725
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,920
This good story

726
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,000
With its attention

727
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,760
Higher and higher

728
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,190
The audience's dependence on it

729
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,040
Also getting stronger and stronger

730
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,400
We have to take precautions

731
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,520
Are you afraid of her

732
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,920
Did you suddenly stop sending letters to the radio station?

733
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,350
Yes, and a postcard

734
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,800
See the content

735
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,110
Anna sent it to the other party

736
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,710
It still remains

737
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,830
Where is Anna's mailing address

738
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,830
Why

739
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,070
Didn't you find a new address

740
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,040
Looking for Anna

741
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,400
Take me back to my mother's house by the way

742
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,680
Teacher He

743
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,190
Now you begin to learn to stick to people

744
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,830
Teacher Qian

745
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,520
You are so shameless now

746
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,350
Let's go

747
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,800
Knife, knife, knife, knife

748
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,110
What kind of knife

749
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,350
Knife, knife, knife, knife

750
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,950
A pig killing knife

751
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,350
One knife, one knife, one knife

752
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,110
Knife and knife make people old

753
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,230
My youth bird

754
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,040
It's already gone

755
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,760
Qian Kaiyi

756
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
If you do this again

757
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,190
Can you get off directly

758
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,230
Is it good to sing

759
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,800
Nice

760
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,830
Comments from those audiences

761
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,000
It's so interesting

762
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,350
I have already started to look forward to it

763
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
Can match your song

764
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,110
That is

765
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,760
You don't see who ordered it

766
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,430
All right, drive well

767
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,800
The tail is up to the sky

768
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,470
Don't worry

769
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,880
This car skill

770
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,710
How do you say

771
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,160
Old and reliable

772
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,040
But to be honest

773
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,310
If I were also born there

774
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,710
The age when the gods in the singing field fought

775
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,070
Maybe I am the same as Anna

776
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,040
I also want to be a singer

777
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,710
This road

778
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,640
The search is too long

779
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,430
Only Wandering footprints

780
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,040
Record for her

781
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,310
Memories of these years

782
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,800
The elapsed time

783
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,640
Killing her waiting

784
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,800
She was afraid that she would forget

785
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,830
Purpose of coming

786
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,830
I'm afraid I will give up halfway

787
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,760
But the one sitting in the back seat of the old motorcycle

788
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,950
The night of farewell to family

789
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,950
Always let her never forget

790
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,560
So between stability and wandering

791
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,190
She chose to continue wandering

792
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,680
Do you know Wang Xiaojun

793
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,280
Who Wang Xiaojun?

794
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,230
Who is Wang Xiaojun?

795
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,520
I don't know

796
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,760
Wang Xiaojun

797
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,880
Wang Xiaojun, you don't know

798
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,640
He is a trumpeter

799
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,760
He played here before

800
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,110
He can also sing

801
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,190
You haven't seen it

802
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
Who are you kidding?

803
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,280
You just don't want to tell me

804
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,710
Let me tell you

805
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,920
If you see him, tell me

806
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,000
I will give you money

807
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,160
OK

808
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Give it, give it, give it

809
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:08,800
Why she

810
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,190
I am really rich

811
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,830
I still don't believe it. I have money

812
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,830
I have money

813
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,880
What are you doing

814
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,920
Don't make trouble here

815
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,070
Why

816
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,350
Stop it

817
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,110
Searching for failure again and again

818
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,040
Let Anna feel tired

819
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,000
She used a way of begging

820
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,920
Trying to get from the audience

821
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,560
Get some

822
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,760
News about Xiaojun

823
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,920
For her

824
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,680
Sitting under the stage at this time

825
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
Not a group

826
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,230
Strange spectators

827
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,400
It is one of her few hopes

828
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,430
Hello

829
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,880
Is there anyone

830
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,190
Who?

831
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,160
Who are you looking

832
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,230
I listen to every episode of your program

833
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,680
I am the real old audience

834
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,470
Aunt

835
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,470
This House

836
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,400
It's yours, isn't it

837
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:00,950
Yes

838
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,310
It used to be my mother

839
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,310
Then my parents passed away

840
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,190
Leave it to me

841
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,880
We ordinary people

842
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,800
Several houses earn rent

843
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,560
Earn extra money

844
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,400
Very good

845
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,430
But you really can't underestimate

846
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,590
Our small shabby house

847
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,800
If I rent it out

848
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,880
2000 or 3000 per month

849
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,280
You said if it was sold

850
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,470
Tens of thousands yuan per square meter

851
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,710
Your house is in the city center.

852
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,830
This area is also so good

853
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,430
These tens of thousands of yuan are cheap

854
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,280
Right

855
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,880
So we are waiting for relocation

856
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,520
Just this one

857
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,230
A house without a bathroom now

858
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,430
Nobody loves renting

859
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,800
Just rent

860
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,350
Also Dangdang warehouse

861
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,400
Release goods or something

862
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,350
Now this place

863
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,470
Seems to be forgotten

864
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,070
Auntie, do you still remember

865
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,880
Twenty or ten years ago, there was a female singer

866
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,350
Did she rent your house

867
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,830
More than twenty years ago

868
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,470
I'm just in my early twenties

869
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,400
At that time, the tenant

870
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,680
My mom is in charge

871
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,760
I'm not sure

872
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,590
Think again

873
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,950
She is a single woman

874
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,430
But she brought a child

875
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,560
I can't remember

876
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,190

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,710

What is your relationship with her

882
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
I have nothing to do with her

883
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,400
Our program

884
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,590
I just want to find a listener

885
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,110

Don't thank me

894
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,310
Your voice is really good

895
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,880
Just a little diva

896
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,350
Although I am just a restaurant manager

897
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,190
Let me tell you

898

In the future

901
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,120
As long as I have a performance here

902
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,760
Just come here

903
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,320

905
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,080
Money doesn't matter

It's good to let me work

907

00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,120
I want to have a look

915
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,600
Why are you looking for someone

916
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,120
The band is the finale tonight.

917

It's okay. I can wait

Then how to do it

Don't sleep with your kids

921
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,230
She is used to it

922
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,280
That won't work

923
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,390
That's it

924
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,280
What about tonight?

925
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,000

Rest in the office
