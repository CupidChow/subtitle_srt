2
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,360
This should be a woman

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,190
You said this person

4
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,270
Could it be Anna

5
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
Don't wait for Anna's ending

6
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,160
This story has no ending

7
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,190
I suddenly feel that you and Anna

8
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,160
Quite similar

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,190
Although this photo

10
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,400
Than when I knew her

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,480
Much younger

12
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,910
But it should be her

13
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,480
You are a little Cola

14
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,360
At that time, you just went to college

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,800
Right

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,870
How do you wander

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,190
Mom, what is the truth

18
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,080
Are you Anna or not

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,470
Can you tell me

20
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,320
Our small Army

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,470
Just to hide from you

22
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,830
They all hid abroad

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,080
I beg you

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,390
Don't look for him again in the future

25
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,030
OK

26
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,440
Xiaojun

27
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,110
Xiran

28
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,910
Let me see

29
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,190
Let my sister have a look

30
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,720
Let me see

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,630
What's wrong with you

32
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,800
What are you doing

33
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,800
Why

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,190
Why cry

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
Only those who are wronged

36
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,960
To cry

37
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,470
I'm not wronged

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,630
Why are you suffering

39
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,190
Look at your face

40
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,320
Look at your hands again

41
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,470
How to perform

42
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,960
How can I play the piano?

43
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,190
Piss me off

44
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,390
Tell me

45
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,550
You look like this now, you

46
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,750
When you are at home

47
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,080
When did I let you work

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,270
Now you put yourself

49
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,240
Make it like this

50
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,630
Why are you suffering?

51
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,630
I used to be ignorant

52
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,110
I make money by my own hands

53
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,320
What's wrong with this

54
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,320
Don't pity me

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,040
Xiran

56
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,640
Let's go home, OK

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,790
Home House

58
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,790
Keep it for you

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,510
The room has never been moved

60
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Will you go home and live?

61
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,600
You go back and have a look

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,390
OK?

63
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,200
I won't go back

64
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,880
I am very good, sister

65
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,670
I'm fine

66
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,720
What are you doing?

67
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,950
Xiaojun has already left

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,920
Do you know

69
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,880
He didn't leave

70
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,600
He promised me

71
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,200
He will take me on a national tour

72
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,000
He also told me

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,880
If we can't afford a house

74
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,720
We will buy a van

75
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Yes, he has me

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,040
This is our home

77
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,550
Don't be silly, OK

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,720
Can you stop being silly

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,350
Sister

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,270
You don't understand

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,350
He said

82
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,830
Buy me a new guitar

83
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,160
We can surround the bonfire together

84
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,640
Singing and Dancing

85
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,390
This is the life I want

86
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,320
This is my dream

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,920
Look

88
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,670
We are not at all alike

89
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,160
We are from two worlds

90
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,510
Leave me alone

91
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,720
You go back

92
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,440
You go back

93
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
What about small COLA

94
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,600
Does she accompany you to travel around the world?

95
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,720
Sister

96
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,160
OK, OK

97
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,320
Don't Cry

98
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
Come on in

99
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,200
Be careful

100
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,110
Slow down

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,110
Whose home is this?

102
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
My home

103
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,550
So beautiful

104
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,670
Sister

105
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,040
You have an object

106
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:54,920
Right

107
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,350
Then I can't live

108
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,880
What are you doing

109
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,040
Where to go

110
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,200
Sit Down

111
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,440
You are capricious

112
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,390
Where are you going

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,640
Where can I live

114
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,760
Return that

115
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,880
The duty room of the warehouse

116
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,830
Can people live

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,270
I have discussed with your brother-in-law

118
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,110
Take the child to you

119
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,670
You and little Cola

120
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,270
Live here steadily

121
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,720
Keep your feet well

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,670
Obedient

123
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,550
I'll get you hot water

124
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,480
Xiping and I

125
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
There are still three days left

126
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,230
The wedding is about to be held.

127
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,510
Results

128
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,440
Do your mother first

129
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,720
Xi Ran's funeral

130
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,670
I must admit

131
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,000
The first time I saw you

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Surprised

133
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,200
How about people

134
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,600
People are gone

135
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,110
The child is

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
She is a little Cola

137
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,720
At that time

138
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,000
I think this kid

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,600
Really weird

140
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,070
I didn't cry after seeing it

141
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,670
Always refused to speak

142
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,230
Be so alert to everyone

143
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,040
Except Xiping

144
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
What does mom say

145
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,640
They said

146
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,640
I hope to go out by myself before

147
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,590
Now it has fallen to this point

148
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,470
It is self-imposed

149
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
For this reason

150
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,350
It is also unacceptable to children

151
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,000
What do you think

152
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,030
Ah Cheng

153
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,910
I want to raise her

154
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,200
Then we are not married yet

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,910
Get married or not

156
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,000
Does not affect this decision

157
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,880
If you agree

158
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,400
We will get married

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,400
If you don't agree

160
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,520
This marriage can also not be married

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,670
I want to talk to you alone

162
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,400
Do you really want to adopt this child

163
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,280
She is my sister's child

164
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,550
I can't ignore it

165
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,030
This is the only thing I can do for Xiran

166
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,400
The last thing I did

167
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,710
If I give up her

168
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
My whole life

169
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,280
Conscience will not be safe

170
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,470
A Cheng

171
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,710
You can not accept it

172
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,230
I don't force you

173
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,550
Let's get this straight

174
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,200
Just Fine

175
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,840
This kid

176
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,960
I must adopt it

177
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,710
As long as Xiping leaves you

178
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,280
You just cried

179
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,750
Later I was relieved

180
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,400
Such a small child

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,350
In this case

182
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,350
Will subconsciously

183
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,670
Find her closest person

184
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,280
You are so accustomed to her, aren't you

185
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,880
Since she came to our house

186
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,230
She doesn't talk all day long

187
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,030
The director said she was not suitable

188
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,000
In their kindergarten

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,520
She is not suitable for kindergarten

190
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,280
Let's take her

191
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,230
Go to the hospital to have a look

192
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,910
What do you mean

193
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,880
Said my child had a problem

194
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,150
Said my child is sick

195
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,760
They didn't say

196
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,710
That is to say, she and the same age group

197
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,200
These children are different

198
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,350
She doesn't talk

199
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,840
Because she was stimulated

200
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,880
She felt insecure

201
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,470
We need to care more about her

202
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,320
All right, I'll go and see her

203
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,670
Small COLA

204
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,590
Are you playing hide-and-seek with mom?

205
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,590
Why are you hiding here

206
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,520
Come out, come out, come out

207
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,790
Is it hot inside

208
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,550
Let me see what's wrong

209
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,080
Why do you cry like a little cat

210
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,710
What's the matter

211
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,670
Mom is afraid

212
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,110
What are you afraid

213
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,230
Isn't mom here

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,590
Look

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,880
Mom took it for you

216
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,000
Favorite cola

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't want Coke

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,790
I don't want it

219
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,150
OK, OK, OK, no, no

220
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,590
Then you talk to mom

221
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,400
What's wrong with you

222
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,440
Aren't we leaving?

223
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,520
Where to go

224
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,520
You said you would take me away

225
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,910
Don't go

226
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,440
Coke is gone

227
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,840
Mom won't leave either

228
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,470
In the future

229
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,760
Mom got off work

230
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,520
Just make a good meal for Coke

231
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,910
Accompany Coke to do homework

232
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,880
We're right here

233
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,640
Never separate for a lifetime

234
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,080
I don't want to lie

235
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,470
Pretend how noble and great you are

236
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,880
Where is Xiping and I?

237
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,790
We met in college

238
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,790
I have been in love for several years

239
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,590
We were getting married that year.

240
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,840
Form your own small family

241
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,110
It turned out to be you

242
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,230
Special Kids

243
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,640
I didn't agree with this matter.

244
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,350
It's Xiping. She insisted on adopting you

245
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,840
Because I love her

246
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,880
So

247
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,350
I followed her

248
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,670
Now that you already know it

249
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,400
Then I will put all the facts

250
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Tell you

251
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,400
I admit it

252
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,110
I am not a perfect person

253
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,320
But your mother Zhao Xiping

254
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,590
I made it for you

255
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,790
What a huge sacrifice

256
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,080
I told you today

257
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,440
I just hope you can know

258
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,880
After all the facts

259
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,590
Just like your mother loves you

260
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,280
You love her

261
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,470
Dunton

262
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,960
Dunton, what's wrong with you

263
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,590
Dunton

264
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,150
Donton donton

265
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,470
Dunton

266
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,440
Dundon, what's wrong with you Dundon

267
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,150
Why did you lock the door, kid

268
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,440
Dunton

269
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
What's wrong with you

270
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,230
You're not feeling well, are you

271
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,280
What's wrong with you

272
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,320
Will Mom take you to the hospital?

273
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
Donton donton

274
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,910
Dunton, your mother called you

275
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,960
Dunton

276
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,150
Donton donton

277
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,840
Hold on, hold on

278
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,400
Hello

279
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,670
Yes, Ayi

280
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,670
Can you come right away

281
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,880
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

282
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,590
OK

283
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,080
Dunton

284
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,710
Listen to your mother

285
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,790
Open the Door

286
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Dunton

287
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,960
My mom

288
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,960
To be exact, my aunt

289
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,280
And Anna

290
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,880
Is my biological mother

291
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,670
A pair of twins

292
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,910
Different personalities

293
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,670
One is to be a star

294
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,550
Another

295
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,590
I just want to live a peaceful life

296
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,760
Sister Zhao Xiran

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,440
Dream of being a singer

298
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,960
It was opposed by the whole family.

299
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,840
Renamed Anna

300
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,760
With the help of my sister Zhao Xiping

301
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,080
To pursue your dreams

302
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,840
And love

303
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,710
But in the end nothing fell

304
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080
She became an unmarried single mother

305
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,670
Very old-fashioned

306
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,030
But also very real

307
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,640
True

308
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,550
Because in this world

309
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,150
There is such a person

310
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
Pursue dreams bravely

311
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,590
Then

312
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,960
Being hurt black and blue by life

313
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,840
But even without Anna

314
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,840
There will also be Li Na Wang Na

315
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,670
People living in this world

316
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,590
Whose body is not hurt

317
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,590
This is the world of adults

318
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,280
Besides

319
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,640
If there were no Anna

320
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,590
Pursue bravely

321
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,400
My dream

322
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,710
There won't be

323
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,790
Our little Cola

324
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,710
Right?

325
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,110
But her world

326
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,710
It is too heavy

327
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,110
Then Anna's ending

328
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,880
What is it like

329
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,350
I don't know yet

330
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,670
Is there no news from her

331
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,790
She's dead

332
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,470
Anna is dead

333
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,350
Xiaoye always asks me for something

334
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,590
It's been a hard time

335
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,000
It's not easy to deal with the instrument

336
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,400
I am not good at doing things

337
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,320
I see your ability

338
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,200
You don't have to doubt yourself

339
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,670
Things about the instrument before

340
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,320
Not passed

341
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,590
Has the psychological association been approved?

342
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,430
Why does it still appear

343
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,280
Such a big mistake

344
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,710
I only do what I do

345
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,160
I am not sure about the rest

346
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,680
Xiaoye Zong

347
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,640
If you are really curious

348
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,800
Why not

349
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,680
Ask Mr. Ye directly

350
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
You father and son

351
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,800
Compared with an outsider like me

352
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,760
Easy to talk

353
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,590
One won't take you

354
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,520
A person in the eyes

355
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,000
He also threatened you with your parents

356
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,880
Is it worth your hard work for him

357
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,830
Xiao Yi

358
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,880
I know

359
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,830
You are an ambitious person

360
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,950
You followed him

361
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,470
Not

362
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,590
Become what it is now

363
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,590
Xiaoye Zong

364
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,160
You think highly of me

365
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,800
I'm just a man

366
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,590
What does the boss ask me to do

367
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,070
What do I have to do

368
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,160
Tell me the truth

369
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,070
This is not only helping me

370
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,110
Also helping yourself

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Retreat from the cliffs

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,190
Good for Everyone

373
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,310
You don't want your parents

374
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,400
Let's be disappointed

375
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,190
Eight o'clock tomorrow night

376
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,520
There will be a batch of new chips

377
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,070
Arrival at port

378
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,310
What do you mean

379
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,280
The problem lies in the chip.

380
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,280
Do you still remember me before

381
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,830
The nightmare I told you about

382
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
You said you dreamed about Aunt Fu all the time

383
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,950
At that time, I thought it was because I didn't have a good rest.

384
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,800
So I always dream about her

385
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,000
But then I recalled

386
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,800
Every time I dream about her

387
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,190
Duplicate elements

388
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,310
You said so many images

389
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,230
It has something to do with her

390
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,880
Is there one

391
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,920
The feeling of fate

392
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,000
Sense of destiny

393
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,070
Don't you think Fu Tang and Anna

394
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,310
Are they very similar

395
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,110
Everyone bravely pursues love

396
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,280
And love freedom so much

397
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
But fate gave them

398
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,640
A joke

399
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,680
You mean

400
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,680
Fu Tang appears in your dream

401
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,590
Because of your subconscious mind

402
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,310
Take fu Tang and Anna

403
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,280
Overlapping together

404
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,160
Very likely

405
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,280
Besides these nightmares

406
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,110
Previous nightmares

407
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,920
Are you still doing it now

408
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,040
Aunt

409
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,880
Small money

410
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,880
How is it going

411
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,680
It's okay. It's much better

412
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,590
Just now she was

413
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,680
I vomited so much

414
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,710
It's okay

415
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,430
It's really okay

416
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,070
OK

417
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,000
I stewed red date chicken soup

418
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
It's Dunton's favorite drink

419
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,710
She will be comfortable later

420
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,800
You let her come out for a drink

421
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,800
Warm stomach

422
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,400
OK, I'll tell her later

423
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,190
You stewed it

424
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,950
Please

425
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,710
Go quickly

426
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,830
Go quickly

427
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,760
You just knew about this

428
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,950
What is the feeling like

429
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,880
Actually, I had a premonition

430
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,230
But today

431
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,230
When I know the answer

432
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,280
Still surprised

433
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,590
Only surprise

434
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,470
Still angry

435
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,470
Angry with whom

436
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,950
Ms. Zhao

437
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,350
Why

438
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,160
I just think

439
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,400
She can not tell me

440
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
About Anna

441
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,400
If she is

442
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,110
At that time I was very young

443
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,230
She is afraid that I will be stimulated if I know

444
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,110
I can understand

445
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,310
But I have grown so big

446
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,110
She is still not ready to tell me

447
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,640
Even she wants to take my own mother

448
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
In my memory

449
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,520
Erase All

450
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,040
Only she wants to tell me

451
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,070
I am qualified to know

452
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,800
What if she doesn't want to tell me

453
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,350
Then I don't know in my life

454
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,310
The existence of Anna

455
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,160
I also don't know my life experience

456
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,350
But after thinking about this, I think

457
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,040
Should not be angry

458
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,520
I don't deserve to be angry

459
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,040
Do you think she is for you

460
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,920
Pay too much

461
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,560
You have no right to blame her

462
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,950
Yes

463
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,000
In fact, I have been doubting

464
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,430
I was already four years old that year

465
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,590
How could I not recognize it

466
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,880
Where is my biological mother

467
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,880
Although the two of them

468
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,760
Looks very similar

469
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,760
But when I held her

470
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,430
When I touched her hand

471
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,710
Can't I feel it

472
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,590
Until just now

473
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,000
I just faced the two of them

474
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,640
The two of them

475
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,520
When explaining to me

476
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,760
I seem to suddenly understand

477
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,190
What do you understand

478
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,590
I think when I was young

479
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,310
I think I saw it

480
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,520
Something bad

481
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,760
I refuse Anna's departure

482
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,470
Do you know

483
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,800
Everyone has

484
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
Psychological Defense function

485
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,190
I probably put that memory

486
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,430
Erased from my memory

487
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,830
I isolated that memory

488
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,880
To protect myself

489
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,280
So I don't remember anything

490
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,590
So when I saw my aunt

491
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,040
It was my mother's time

492
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,520
I seem to see a life-saving straw

493
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,520
I think that is my mother

494
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,310
I may have been there all the time

495
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,230
Deceive myself

496
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,920
Including I hate my stepfather

497
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,110
I think except because

498
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,190
He always let my mom

499
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,470
Make a choice between us

500
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,590
Another biggest problem

501
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,310
Just before the age of four

502
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,180
My mother and I

503
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,190
They live together

504
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,520
There is only my mother in my world

505
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,800
In my mother's world

506
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,590
Only me

507
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,230
Until it suddenly appeared

508
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,070
A man

509
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,710
Let me take care of that man

510
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,590
Call Dad

511
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,950
He took away my mom

512
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,830
He encroached on our lives

513
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,110
I'm scared

514
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,680
I think my mother will choose him

515
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,800
Will lose my mother

516
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,830
So this fear

517
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,950
Until now

518
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,040
I don't agree with my stepfather

519
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
The reason why I remarried my mother

520
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,520
I think it's not just because

521
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,040
He abandoned my mother

522
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,000
Abandoned me

523
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,880
The biggest reason is

524
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,680
I am afraid of being chosen again

525
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,470
I'm afraid

526
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,800
My mother will choose him again

527
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,280
I'm afraid my mom doesn't want me

528
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,160
I am afraid that I will lose my mother again

529
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,950
I don't know

530
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,160
You analyze yourself

531
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,800
So clear

532
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,160
But is there another possibility

533
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,070
You didn't expect it

534
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,640
Your mother has been here for so many years

535
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,400
I didn't tell you

536
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,710
Could she be afraid

537
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,070
Afraid to tell you

538
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,590
I lost you

539
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,350
Lose Me

540
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,190
Although you are not your own mother and daughter

541
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
But in my opinion

542
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,280
She really regards you

543
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,040
My own daughter

544
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,470
Could she also hesitate

545
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,000
If this matter

546
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,760
She told you

547
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,040
Then you two

548
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,710
I will never go back to the past

549
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,350
But I won't change

550
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,950
I can't leave her

551
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,680
But does she know

552
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,190
Will she be like you

553
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,880
Struggling

554
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,950
I wonder if you will choose her

555
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,640
Then why did she

556
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,280
I also want to say something about Anna

557
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,760
Maybe compared with losing you

558
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,040
She is more worried about your unhappy life

559
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,190
Do you want to ask her

560
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:46,950
Mom

561
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,880
Don't touch mom

562
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,310
Don't move

563
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,680
Mom

564
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,520
Sorry

565
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,520
Actually, when I heard it just now

566
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,190
I still feel a little uncomfortable

567
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,110
I don't believe it

568
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,640
I was confused for a while

569
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,880
I don't know myself

570
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,000
Is it Heton or small COLA

571
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
So I'm scared

572
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,640
Until I calm down

573
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,830
I recall all this

574
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,880
I changed from Coke to Horton

575
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,880
It's all because there is a person

576
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,760
Always be tolerant behind me

577
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,280
Love Me

578
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,680
Love Me

579
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,590
I actually know

580
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,070
I was very ignorant when I was young.

581
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,230
I always make trouble

582
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,640
I always fight for favor with my younger brother

583
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,520
Quarrel with Lao He

584
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,040
That's because I don't feel safe

585
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,710
I'm afraid

586
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
I'm afraid

587
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,040
I lost my mother again

588
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,110
Everything you did for me

589
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,830
No one can replace it

590
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,040
You made the Coke

591
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,710
Becomes the present Horton

592
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,430
You gave everything

593
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,590
I want to raise her

594
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,160
If you agree

595
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,520
We will get married

596
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,470
If you don't agree

597
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,680
This marriage can also not be married

598
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,920
You said that in the world

599
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,400
How could there be such a silly person

600
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,830
She clearly knew that little Cola was

601
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,470
Yes

602
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,160
It's my sister's child

603
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,430
Not my daughter, right

604
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,640
After my sister left

605
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,350
I decided to bring you here

606
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,400
At that time

607
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,760
I'm really not ready

608
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,190
I just think

609
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,470
I love my sister anyway

610
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,590
What are the difficulties

611
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,520
I'm sure I can make it

612
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,400
You just said you

613
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,640
Trouble

614
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,070
Fight for favor with younger brother

615
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,350
I looked at you at that time

616
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,230
Deliberately make trouble with me

617
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,950
Don't listen to me on purpose

618
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,430
Don't eat on purpose

619
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,830
I am really happy

620
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,230
Really

621
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,950
The more you compete with me

622
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,160
The more I feel

623
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,590
My mother succeeded

624
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,710
Dunton, she recognized me

625
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,830
Then you grew up

626
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,160
Am I your mother

627
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,470
Are you my child

628
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,920
Anyway, I can't leave you

629
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,680
I have already thought about it

630
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,000
I want to wait for you to grow up

631
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,470
I will take your life experience

632
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,190
Tell you

633
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,830
But I'm afraid I'll tell you

634
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,640
This thing

635
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,950
It hit you so hard

636
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,040
You can't bear it

637
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,350
In case you go again

638
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,190
Go the same way as my sister

639
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,880
So you forgive mom

640
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,280
For so many years

641
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,160
Always lying to you

642
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,040
Mom is too selfish

643
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,190
Sorry, Dundon

644
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,040
I shouldn't have done this

645
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,760
Mom

646
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,760
Mom

647
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,520
Mom

648
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,760
Thank you for giving me a home

649
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,470
I love you forever

650
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,430
I will always

651
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,040
I won't leave you

652
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,110
Thank you

653
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,000
Thank you, mom

654
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,430
Mom

655
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,430
Sorry

656
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,430
Make You Laugh

657
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,160
Look at You

658
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,950
OK

659
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,310
Dunton

660
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,920
It's in this iron box

661
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,880
It's all the same year

662
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,590
The letter Anna wrote to me

663
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,430
And postcards

664
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,560
After I helped Anna escape

665
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,350
I went to the north to study

666
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,880
Then Anna

667
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,470
Running around east, west, north and south

668
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,560
To find Xiaojun

669
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,350
But she went everywhere

670
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,000
Will write me a letter

671
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,230
Or a postcard

672
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,350
For so many years

673
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,350
I keep it all the time

674
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,520
I just want

675
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,230
One day I will give it to you

676
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,470
I said

677
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,110
Anna is a

678
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,880
People who love life very much

679
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,640
Just look at it

680
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,430
See words like a face

681
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,830
I gave it to you

682
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,950
Do you want to see it

683
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,680
Don't want to see

684
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,710
If you feel very angry

685
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,590
It's hard for you to solve

686
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,950
It even affects your normal life

687
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,560
Then I think

688
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,040
The person who should consult is yourself

689
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,110
But he Dun is not used to it

690
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,070
This closed space

691
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,230
Claustrophobia

692
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,950
Don't touch me

693
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,880
Can you stay away from me

694
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,760
Can you stay away from me

695
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,000
What dream scared you like this

696
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,710
Nothing

697
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,880
I thought of something bad

698
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,160
Can I have a word with you

699
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,310
