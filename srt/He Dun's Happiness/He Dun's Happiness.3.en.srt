2
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
You asked us to check

3
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,400
The address on Anna's letter

4
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,160
It's fake

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,870
Fake

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,950
Yes, and a postcard

7
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,400
See the content

8
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,630
Anna sent it to the other party

9
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,310
It still remains

10
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,440
Where is Anna's mailing address

11
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,080
Auntie, do you still remember

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,870
Twenty or ten years ago, there was a female singer

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
Did she rent your house

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,870
She is a single woman

15
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,270
But she brought a child

16
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,100
I remember

17
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,270
I know this woman

18
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,880
You know that woman

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,800
Who is it?

20
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you know Wang Xiaojun

21
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,360
Who Wang Xiaojun?

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,110
Who is Wang Xiaojun?

23
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,600
Wang Xiaojun, you don't know

24
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,440
Who is he

25
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,750
If you see him, tell me

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,830
I will give you money

27
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,880
I have money

28
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,080
Drink two more Cups

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,720
Thank you

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,910
Would you like to add some more dishes?

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,360
Add or not

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,000
No More

33
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,830
No More

34
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,830
What's the matter

35
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,390
Sorry, I mistook one for another

36
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,520
Do you know one

37
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
Is it called Xiaojun's trumpet player?

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,030
I don't know

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,270
I'm joking with you

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,550
I know Xiaojun

41
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,360
Really?

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,630
Yes

43
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,000
Originally

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,190
He is coming here today

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,080
But he has something to do temporarily

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I went somewhere else

47
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,630
Then where did he go

48
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,470
He said he had gone to the north

49
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,520
North

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,720
When will you be back?

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,000
Not clear

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,830
Should go for a while

53
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,670
I'm busy first

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,030
God seems to give Anna

55
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,100
A joke

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,550
In front of me

57
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,830
A man who looks like a small army

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,080
Will Anna all hope

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
At this moment

60
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,750
All turned into disappointment

61
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,350
She didn't know to keep looking

62
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,880
What will be the result

63
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,440
Anna

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,160
But she still has no hesitation

65
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,950
Once again set foot on this slim

66
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,880
An unpromising journey

67
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,350
This Anna

68
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,760
Sounds like a child

69
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,670
I didn't know she was alone

70
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,160
Can you take good care of small COLA

71
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,830
You said she left without saying goodbye

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,760
It's because suddenly there is

73
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,670
The whereabouts of the small army

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
I don't understand

75
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,880
You said she would leave

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,480
Why do you follow the landlord's phone number?

77
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,600
Was the phone very valuable in those days?

78
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,760
Of course

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,270
At that time

80
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,510
If you install a phone

81
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,670
At least 1000 or 2000

82
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,110
You said to put it now

83
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,830
1000 or 2000

84
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,790
It's not a small number

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,830
But why did she steal the phone

86
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,880
There is no telephone line

87
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,160
I can't get through either.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,070
Coke

89
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,550
Hurry up and pack up the things

90
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,480
We should go

91
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,110
What's the matter

92
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Why are you so unhappy

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,160
Mom is talking to you

94
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,230
You can't hear me, can you

95
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,880
After a while, mom got angry

96
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,600
Mom's luggage

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,760
It has been packed up

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,600
Do you want to clean up

99
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,920
I don't care about you

100
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,350
Why?

101
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,000
Mom will buy you another phone number

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,670
Can't you

103
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,110
Let me see what's wrong

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,670
Let me see my little baby

105
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,350
What's the matter

106
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,230
Let me tell you something

107
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
I have found your father

108
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
I know where he is now

109
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,070
I'll take you to find him right away

110
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,760
OK

111
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,440
Dad saw little Cola

112
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,000
I will be very happy

113
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,790
Buy it for you

114
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,270
A lot of coke

115
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,390
OK?

116
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,200
Go

117
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,200
Mom

118
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,950
Can we find dad

119
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,760
Of course

120
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,510
Go

121
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,110
Go to dad

122
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,390
Let's go

123
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,070
Maybe there is another possibility

124
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,950
That's what the landlord said

125
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,480
We can't believe it all, can we?

126
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,550
After all, it's been twenty or ten years

127
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Maybe Anna

128
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,160
Really met

129
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,230
What emergencies

130
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,000
It is also possible

131
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,640
I think so

132
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,390
But one thing

133
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,350
You can rest assured

134
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,110
What

135
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,230
What the landlord said at least proves

136
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,950
Anna

137
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,920
It is real

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,950
But you said this sender

139
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,110
Who on earth is it

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,760
Could it be Anna

141
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,350
If it's Anna

142
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,880
Why is she

143
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,830
I want to leave a fake address

144
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,350
I listen to what you mean

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,670
Do you still want to keep looking

146
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,920
Of course

147
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,950
If it were you

148
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,320
Will you give up so lightly

149
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,440
But then again

150
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,920
I think Anna is very similar to you

151
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,640
Like Me

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,760
Where does it look like

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
You are all like that

154
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,950
Identify one thing

155
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,160
No matter what others say

156
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,320
You will all insist

157
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,200
Right

158
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,390
But what's different

159
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,270
She is for love

160
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,000
You are

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,950
Stick to your faith

162
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,110
Qian Kaiyi

163
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,550
I heard what you said

164
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,510
You mean I am stubborn

165
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,640
I didn't say that

166
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,000
Besides

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,790
What's wrong with stubbornness

168
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,880
Stubbornness indicates that we are right about people and things.

169
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,000
Have their own persistence

170
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,230
You have an attitude, right

171
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,670
But sometimes

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,640
What

173
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,550
You are going back to the office later

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,920
Or go back to our mom

175
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,230
Let me ask you

176
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,760
Do you think in my mother and he Zhaocheng

177
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,830
In this matter

178
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,480
I did not go too far

179
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,510
Although I don't know

180
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,230
Your stepfather's behavior

181
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,110
What does it look like

182
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,110
But I think he treats aunt

183
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,270
Still have feelings

184
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,710
And I always think

185
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
What he did in those years

186
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,910
I regret it

187
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,400
How do you know he is regretting

188
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,080
You asked him secretly

189
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,150
I have work to do tomorrow

190
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,760
You can send me back to the studio

191
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,400
OK

192
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,670
From the existing clues

193
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,470
Anna was born in 1996

194
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,710
Seafood restaurant used to be a resident singer

195
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,960
Then let's

196
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,550
Find it according to the seafood restaurant

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
How to find this

198
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,440
Not to mention

199
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,670
Seafood Restaurant on the street

200
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,000
1996

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,030
Twenty years ago

202
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,400
Maybe the house has been demolished

203
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,440
But now we have to find

204
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,790
People who knew Anna in those days

205
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,910
Only in this way can it be proved

206
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,030
Anna's story is true

207
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,400
Now I only rely on these letters

208
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,000
Our choice

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,840
Too little

210
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,910
It's not impossible

211
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,640
According to the description in the letter

212
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,150
The business of this seafood restaurant in those years

213
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,320
It is very popular

214
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,840
In the current words

215
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,440
This is an Internet celebrity restaurant.

216
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,030
We are new here

217
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,880
A group of interns

218
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,790
They are all very capable

219
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,110
I think let them look for it

220
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,280
Maybe we can find clues

221
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,230
OK, you two

222
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,960
For this program is almost a detective

223
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,110
That is

224
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,030
This professional quality tells me

225
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,710
You must know that it is difficult, right?

226
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,910
Chasing after

227
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,760
Horton

228
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,230
I'm curious

229
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,840
Why do you think about this case

230
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,470
So attentive

231
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,710
I don't know

232
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,520
Since I met

233
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,590
After Aunt Fu

234
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,710
I would dream about her frequently

235
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,960
I always feel that in me

236
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,550
Somewhere deep inside

237
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,710
Established some kind of connection with her

238
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,880
Especially I heard it

239
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,400
After Anna's love story

240
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,640
I would think

241
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,840
Anna's persistence in Love

242
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,280
It reminds me of Aunt Fu

243
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,440
Maybe because of their love

244
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,280
It's hard

245
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,200
But it's also very hot

246
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,840
Why

247
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,320
You have grown up

248
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
You really understand

249
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,440
I am very hot now

250
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,550
Hot, right

251
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,320
Have a cup of orange lemon tea

252
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,200
Eliminate the fire, you

253
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,760
This letter says

254
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,960
Anna went to the north

255
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,550
Find the trumpeter named Xiaojun

256
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,280
Didn't you find it at last?

257
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,760
None

258
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,080
The letter says

259
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
After Anna arrived in the North

260
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,320
I have been looking for it for three months.

261
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,590
She visited all the bars

262
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,880
Not found

263
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,030
Strange

264
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,760
At that time, the circle of singers was so small

265
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,960
Why did she find a trumpeter

266
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,640
It will be so difficult

267
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
I don't know

268
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,440
Maybe the information is wrong

269
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,520
Or Xiaojun

270
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,670
I didn't go to the north at all

271
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,470
Anyway, Anna put on

272
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,760
All the money has been spent

273
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,640
Come back

274
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,760
I really don't understand

275
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,000
You said she was looking for it like this

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,960
Like a headless fly

277
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,910
I can't find it at all

278
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,790
Why is she so persistent

279
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,400
Maybe the small army

280
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,790
Just deliberately hiding from her

281
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,790
You said put it now

282
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,280
There can't be such a girl

283
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,550
Will find your lover like this

284
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,280
I can think of one hundred

285
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,440
Let her give up the reason to look

286
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,150
But you can say she is stupid

287
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,320
It is better to say that she is persistent

288
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,400
She just won't give up

289
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,280
Do you know

290
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,760
The little girl in our desk

291
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,640
After listening to this story

292
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,910
So touched

293
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,590
It's like I'm lovelorn

294
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,910
And those with red eyes

295
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,520
What's the matter now

296
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,760
Never despise a woman

297
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,520
Once a woman loves

298
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,110
It's like

299
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,320
Just like a moth on fire

300
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,080
Desperate

301
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,110
Are you talking about yourself?

302
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,670
Lao he, why are you now

303
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,760
Turn your elbow outward

304
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,710
Women should be united front

305
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,280
OK

306
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,790
You don't want to put our house down

307
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,760
I have missed the belt

308
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,640
The mentality of our family

309
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,280
Very good

310
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,520
If you want to go crazy, go crazy yourself

311
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,280
Bully me, nobody loves me, doesn't it

312
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,640
Where is that little policeman comrade

313
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,550
Qian Kaiyi

314
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,670
I count by fingers

315
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,760
You will have a bloody disaster today

316
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
OK, OK

317
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,080
Can you two stop quarrelling

318
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,230
Can you say something about business?

319
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,520
That seafood restaurant

320
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,640
Did you find it later

321
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,670
Of course

322
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,960
Really?

323
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,200
Then why didn't you say it earlier

324
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,670
Am I not in a hurry to read the letter?

325
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,640
What if there are new clues

326
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
Deliberately selling the key

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,760
Who can't see it

328
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,030
What do I sell

329
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,670
These are all

330
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,670
The contribution of the trainee below

331
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,790
Let me tell you something

332
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,590
Now these kids

333
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,710
The way is real

334
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,110
Tell me to wait another two days

335
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,000
Maybe

336
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,280
Even photos can be found

337
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,640
That's great

338
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,790
But this seafood restaurant

339
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,760
Has closed down

340
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,790
But this seafood restaurant

341
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,440
Where is the boss?

342
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
He is very famous

343
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,080
Chen

344
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,520
What about people in this industry

345
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,470
Everyone calls him boss Chen

346
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,470
Horton

347
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,910
I asked him to go to the greenhouse for a while.

348
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,640
Meet

349
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,280
OK

350
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,000
Manager Chen, be careful

351
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,670
Don't help me

352
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,320
I have retired for so many years

353
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,960
Stop calling me manager Chen

354
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,640
OK

355
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,880
Just call me Mr. Chen

356
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,520
Uncle Chen

357
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,030
Yes

358
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Sit Down

359
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,640
Thank you

360
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,400
What about your program?

361
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,470
Very famous

362
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
When I was young

363
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,910
I like listening to radio programs

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,710
Uncle Chen

365
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,640
I am looking for you this time

366
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,110
I want to spy on someone

367
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,790
Sorry

368
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,470
Is it convenient for me to record

369
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,590
Of course no problem

370
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,150
Thank you

371
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,640
I want to inquire about a singer

372
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,960
Who do you want to inquire about

373
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,520
Where's her name? Anna

374
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,520
Do you still remember

375
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,840
Anna

376
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,910
Yes

377
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,790
About

378
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,910
Around 1996

379
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,590
The seafood restaurant where she works

380
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,350
Worked

381
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,150
You always called her at that time

382
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,110
Where is the little sea Lotus

383
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,880
At that time, he claimed to be himself

384
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,030
It belongs to little Heavenly King and Little Diva

385
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,520
Too many to count

386
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,590
She has a child beside her

387
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,790
It's called Small COLA

388
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,470
You're talking about Anna

389
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,200
I remember

390
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,350
There is such a person

391
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,320
But

392
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,790
She is not a singer either.

393
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
She

394
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,840
Not clear-headed

395
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,350
I didn't focus on singing

396
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,920
Although our city is not big

397
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
But there are many talented people

398
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,000
Anna's throat

399
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,280
If she is angry

400
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,280
Maybe you can become a big star

401
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,070
But she has no such ambition

402
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,070
In my whole life

403
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,640
I 've seen a lot of potential

404
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,800
Capable singer

405
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,680
Take your own future

406
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,400
It's gone

407
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
Just for one thing

408
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,000
Love

409
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,350
Yes

410
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,430
Just can't pass the emotional barrier

411
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,400
Anna gives Xiaojun every day

412
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,520
Make countless calls

413
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,070
Call 31319

414
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,880
Ten times

415
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,560
Call Me Later

416
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,280
OK

417
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,710
There was no mobile phone at that time.

418
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
They all use pagers

419
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,280
But that little army

420
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,520
He didn't call back once

421
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,950
He is hiding from Anna

422
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,710
I remember once

423
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,520
I was here to perform

424
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,350
Xiaojun

425
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,640
But he knew Anna was here

426
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,000
He didn't come

427
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,430
Sorry, I mistook one for another

428
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,400
I remember at the beginning

429
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,430
When we were there

430
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,400
It's like

431
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,680
An information transfer station

432
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,680
Who wants to do something

433
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,160
He has to come and ask me

434
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,950
You were so good then

435
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,470
Did you help Anna

436
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,640
I went to see Xiaojun

437
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,560
Why didn't you help

438
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,520
Less than three months

439
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,950
Everyone in the city knows

440
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,830
Anna is looking for Xiaojun

441
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,800
This small Army

442
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,350
I have already run to the north

443
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,040
Anna was still thinking about it

444
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,760
Chasing

445
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,470
But it didn't take long to come back

446
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,590
Manager Chen

447
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,400
You get out of here

448
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,040
Get Out

449
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,070
Manager Chen

450
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,230
I was wrong

451
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,110
I know I was wrong

452
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,470
I shouldn't leave without saying goodbye

453
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,430
You

454
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,830
Please give me another chance

455
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,280
What is a chance

456
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,590
If I hadn't looked at you

457
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,950
Young with a child

458
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,920
Life is not easy

459
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,280
How can I

460
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,230
Let you perform here

461
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,040
It's not what you think

462
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,110
Where am I

463
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,760
You can come and leave whenever you want.

464
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,470
Isn't it

465
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,710
Isn't it

466
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,590
Manager Chen, listen to me

467
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,560
My pager that day

468
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,430
No electricity

469
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,560
So I didn't hear it

470
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,070
Sorry, I'm really sorry

471
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,350
I really know I was wrong

472
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,560
Just give me another chance

473
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,760
After that

474
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,760
I will sing two more songs

475
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,560
No, no, no

476
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,830
I don't want money, OK

477
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,710
Can I sing for free

478
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,560
Okay, okay, you go, go, go

479
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,430
Can you just let me stay

480
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,560
Go, Go, go, manager Chen is gone

481
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,110
No, isn't it

482
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,470
Just give me another chance

483
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,680
Walk

484
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,430
How do you, this kid, bite you

485
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,230
Why?

486
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,350
How to bite uncle

487
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,110
Xiao Yang, come on, come on

488
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,760
Get her out of here

489
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,190
Manager Chen

490
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,110
Hungry or not

491
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,280
Not hungry

492
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,350
Mom will test you

493
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,160
OK

494
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,590
What is Mom's pager number?

495
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,000
126 call 80756

496
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,470

501
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,280
If we get separated from mom

502
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,040
What will you do

503
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,160
Stay where you are and wait for mom

504
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,430
What if mom doesn't come

505
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,190
What should I do

506
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,760
Find the police Uncle

507
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,190
Call Mom

508

511
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,430
Yes

512
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,280
Yes

513
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,680

Never reply to our call

516
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,070
Possible

517
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,710
Dad lost his pager, right?

518
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,430
Then when shall we

519

We will find him soon

521
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,830
Maybe dad is looking for us too

522
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,000
It's just that we missed it

523
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,680
Why Dad

524
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,830
Don't look for the police Uncle

525
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,160
Call us

526
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,400
Because

527
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,110
Because your father

528
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,800
Is a little fool

529
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,430
Manager

530
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,680
What's the matter

531
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,070
The two men didn't leave

532
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,160
Sitting at the door of the store

533
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,400
What

534
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,830
Why don't you go and have a look

535
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,110
Go ahead

536
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,070
OK

537
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,560
Then we must find dad

538
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,830
Or dad will let the bad guys

539
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,760
Taken away

540
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,710
Yes

541
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,000
We must find dad

542
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
Otherwise, your father will let the bad guys

543
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,560
Take it away

544
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,760
Let's cheer together

545
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,310
Does it hurt

546
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,800
Of course it hurts

547
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,800
It's lighter

548
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,230
She is a woman

549
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,430
With a child

550
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
I heard that once I arrived in the North

551
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,760
The wallet was stolen

552
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,400
She has no acquaintance in the North

553
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,280
Second, no job

554
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,830
There is not even a place to live

555
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,710
I just gnawed the steamed bread for more than ten days.

556
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,280
Also don't know her along the way

557
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,000
How much have you suffered

558
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,070
When I saw her again

559
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,880
The whole person lost a lot of weight

560
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,000
Everyone, hurry up

561
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,280
When it was closed that day

562
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,520
She was still sitting at the gate of the hotel.

563
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,280
Little Cola lay on her leg

564
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,000
Fall asleep

565
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,310
She saw me and didn't speak

566
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,040
Just laughing

567
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,040
I knew it when I saw her eyes

568
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,280
She is really desperate

569
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,520
Come on

570
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,310
Let me do it

571
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,160
I'll do it

572
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,710
You can get off work after finishing the shop

573
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,560
OK

574
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,280
Tonight

575
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,110
You just live here

576
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,110
Thank you

577
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,430
Don't get me wrong

578
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,520
I didn't say

579
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,680
You can stay here all the time

580
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,880
Only Tonight

581
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,040
Thank you

582
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,470
I said you are a little girl

583
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,950
Is it worth it

584
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,680
Not for yourself

585
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,950
We should also consider it for our children.

586
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,430
So small

587
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,680
Just follow you everywhere

588
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,310
Coke, come on, thank you, Uncle

589
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,280
Thank you, Uncle

590
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,710
Lovely

591
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,560
I just say it casually

592
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,880
Go to bed early

593
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,520
When sleeping

594
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,190
Remember to lock the door

595
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,310
I can go to your store for free

596
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,470
Singing as a waiter

597
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,950
Just pay the rent, okay

598
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,160
Let's talk about it

599
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,830
Women

600
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,470
Once she moves true feelings

601
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,350
Then she can't listen to anyone's words

602
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,280
But small money

603
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,280
Do you think Anna is really stupid

604
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,310
Do you think she really doesn't know

605
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,310
She is escaping from reality

606
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,230
She wants to try

607
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,710
To wake up a person pretending to sleep

608
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,800
But this result

609
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,230
It will only make her more painful

610
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,310
You are a wise man

611
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,000
In fact, she gave it to me later

612
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,800
I made a call

613
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,520
I'll pick it up

614
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,830
She has been crying

615
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,230
I asked her what was wrong

616
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
She didn't speak either.

617
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,190
Cry for a while

618
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,160
Just hang up the phone

619
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,710
I also called her several times

620
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,310
The pager can be connected

621
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,830
But just don't answer

622
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,830
More than a month later

623
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,070
This pager stops

624
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,830
Is there something wrong with her?

625
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,040
I guess

626
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,830
Either she found Xiaojun

627
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,350
Family Reunion

628
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,000
Or

629
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,190
In addition, I got married

630
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,880
Then

631
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,350
Do you still remember Anna's real name

632
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,400
I don't know

633
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,830
The singer who came to my store at that time

634
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,000
Come and go

635
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's like a horse lantern

636
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,800
I can't even remember their real names

637
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,800
Anna is in my shop

638
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,230
I did it too

639
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Less than three months

640
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,520
Every time you check out

641
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,040
I paid her in cash

642
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,160
So her real name

643
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,110
I don't know

644
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,920
By the way, I have her photo

645
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,760
Do you want it

646
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,590
Uncle Chen, of course I want it

647
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,560
Why didn't you say it earlier?

648
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,280
Who is Anna on this

649
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,830
Wear that

650
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,920
The one in the waiter's clothes

651
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,920
Now all the clues are broken

652
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,160
This photo alone

653
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,110
It's hard to find someone

654
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,160
Who said all the clues were broken

655
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,880
This old gentleman left only one

656
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,040
Very useful clues

657
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,110
What clues

658
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,400
He said he later

659
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,590
I met Anna once

660
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
I remember

661
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,280
I have seen Anna's once

662
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,190
Where is it

663
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,160
Let me think about how many years

664
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,590
When my daughter was in Grade One

665
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,880
It was 1998

666
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,640
Yes

667
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,470
1998

668
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,230
1998

669
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
There will be a parents' meeting at that time.

670
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,280
My wife has caught a cold

671
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,640
I went there

672
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,800
He said he was going to hold a parents' meeting

673
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,640
I 've seen one

674
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,470
A particularly familiar face

675
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,070
This person is Anna

676
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,520
Teacher Zhao

677
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,430
Teacher Zhao

678
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,280
Teacher Li

679
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,160
Walk slowly

680
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,230
Your daughter is also right away

681
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,190
Have you been promoted to the second grade?

682
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,230
I heard that my academic performance is very good

683
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,040
Not like my boy

684
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,880
Very leather

685
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,430
I didn't bother you, did I?

686
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,000
Not bad recently

687
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,920
Great progress

688
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,880
That's good, that's good

689
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,310
So

690
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,310
Anna's daughter

691
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,400
With manager Chen's daughter

692
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,230
Classmates

693
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,710
Not in the same class

694
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,710
But in the same grade

695
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,710
Manager Chen and Anna

696
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,470
Did you say hello?

697
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,230
None

698
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,430
Why

699
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,710
He said Anna has changed a lot

700
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,350
It looks quite stable

701
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,760
At least from the expression

702
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,710
I didn't see the past

703
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,070
That anxiety and tension

704
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,880
So I didn't come forward to say hello

705
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Afraid of provoking others

706
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,830
Bad memories

707
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,070
Grade One, 1998

708
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,470
Anna's daughter

709
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,350
Big with me

710
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,950
Yes, you are also born in 1992

711
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,880
Yes

712
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,520
The daughter of manager Chen

713
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,560
Small COLA

714
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,400
Since it is from a school

715
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,400
Have they seen each other again

716
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,560
He said he had seen it once

717
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,350
I am afraid

718
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,190
I can't find it now

719
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,520
Student Information 20 to 10 years ago

720
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,000
What's Anna's name

721
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,710
I don't know

722
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,680
What is the name of Coke

723
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,310
I don't even know

724
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,950
How to Check

725
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,590
Have you asked

726
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,760
Which school do they belong?

727
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,800
Hetian Primary School

728
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,000
Hetian Primary School

729
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,640
Yes

730
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,520
The one in Haibei District

731
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,000
Yes, what's the matter

732
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,950
My mother used to be a teacher there

733
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,180
Aunt Zhao is not

734
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,070
Experimental Middle School?

735
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,520
That was later.

736
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,190
What are you waiting

737
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,680
Let's ask Aunt Zhao

738
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,760
Don't worry

739
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,040
I'll see my mom later

740
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,830
Ask her face to face

741
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,800
That instrument that thing

742
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,950
How did it go

743
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,880
Excuse me

744
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,350
Hello

745
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,000
Hello

746
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,950
I am Haitang Pharmaceutical Technology

747
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,710
Limited Company

748
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,920
Hello

749
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,110
I want to ask you something

750
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,230
Some time ago in your hospital

751
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,110
From the channel provider

752
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,920
I bought a batch

753
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,950
Made by our company

754
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,190
Electromagnetic psychotherapy instrument

755
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,190
Do you know about this

756
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,950
You mean that

757
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,400
The instrument on the head

758
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,000
Yes

759
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,520
After the old man on our side wore it

760
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,560
They all said they were uncomfortable

761
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,430
Just because I received it

762
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,400
A lot of negative feedback

763
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,310
So this time the company sent me here

764
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,950
Want to recycle this batch of instruments

765
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
Do a free back-to-factory upgrade

766
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,950
Free

767
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,190
No charge

768
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,040
Any fees

769
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,310
But that thing

770
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,640
Everyone said it was not easy to use

771
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,310
Let our Dean throw it to the warehouse

772
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,110
Warehouse

773
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,280
Warehouse

774
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,350
You mean

775
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Now I don't know Anna

776
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,560
And the real name of Coke

777
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,190
Right

778
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,000
All I know is that he was once in

779
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,000
Hetian Primary School saw her

780
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,590
Yes

781
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,590
That's almost what it means

782
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,110
Mom

783
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,710
I think Anna must be that kind of person

784
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,110
Let others have a look

785
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,040
A woman who will have a deep memory

786
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
Although I have never seen her

787
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,470
But I treat her

788
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,560
And the small COLA

789
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Everyone is very curious

790
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,680
Are there any curious children

791
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,070
I just want to know

792
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Anna and Coke

793
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,520
How are you doing now

794
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,520
I hope both of them

795
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,880
Now you can be lucky

796
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,520
Yes

797
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,830
Help me see something

798
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,430
Look at it

799
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,430
Is this Anna

800
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Have you seen her before

801
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,070
Is it in your school

802
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,950
Once a teacher

803
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,920
I don't even remember

804
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,070
You didn't even look carefully

805
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,000
Please help me take a good look

806
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,190
Do you have any impression

807
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,000
Can't see clearly

808
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,590
Photos taken many years ago

809
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,560
Very fuzzy

810
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,760
Mom is dazzled now

811
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,430
Can't see clearly

812
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,070
Teacher Xiao Wen

813
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,880
After I left you last time

814
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,520
I 've been thinking about it since I went back.

815
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,830
Have a look

816
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,760
I just want to be handsome

817
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,040
I just put his clothes

818
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,280
Or take out the photos

819
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,190
Talk to him and cry

820
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,070
But I cried out

821
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,830
My heart

822
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,110
Still very blocked

823
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,710
This time I will

824
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,230
According to what you said

825
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,830
I want to go out bravely

826
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,640
I went to see him

827
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,000
As soon as I entered that place that day

828
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,470
I saw the picture of Junjun

829
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,400
He has been laughing at me

830
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,230
I really

831
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,640
I heard his laughter

832
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,520
Just such a small child

833
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,000
It's already one

834
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,350
People with tombstones

835
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,280
But I was there

836
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,560
I told him a lot

837
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,470
I told him everything I wanted to say.

838
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,640
I went home like this

839
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,190
After going home

840
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,590
Me

841
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,280
Look at me

842
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,640
I have lived in this House for more than ten years.

843
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,160
It's too messy everywhere

844
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,190
I started to clean up

845
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,560
Where there are corners

846
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,430
I wiped it clean

847
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,950
I also threw away all the things that should be thrown away

848
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,520
You need to know

849
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,710
Usually I have to do so much work

850
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm sure I'll get tired

851
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,000
Not that day

852
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,280
I am very energetic

853
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,880
I dragged the floor

854
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,230
Put every glass

855
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,680
They are all wiped clean

856
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,400
I also changed water for the fish tank

857
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,590
You are really strange

858
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,160
More than ten years have passed

859
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,040
Maybe I was standing there

860
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,000
Look at home

861
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,400
It's clean everywhere

862
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
My heart

863
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,350
The Block

864
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,310
It seems to be connected at once

865
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,000
You mean

866
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,000
The pain of losing his son

867
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,160
Seems to be a little bit less

868
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,190
Right

869
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,350
Really

870
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,190
In fact, this matter

871
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,080
It's been more than ten years

872
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,320
This is the moment

873
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,520
I really think

874
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,190
Junjun really left

875
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,080
There are some things I think maybe

876
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,520
Start and end

877
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,630
It's just a flash

878
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
I remember I gave birth to Junjun at that time

879
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,190
Nothing is very common

880
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,590
Until he

881
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,670
It's my first time to walk

882
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:39,000
It's my first time to call Mom

883
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,430
It's the first time to carry a small schoolbag

884
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,470
Go to School

885
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,120
I just know

886
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,430
My little baby

887
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,670
Just like the sky

888
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,280
Give me a Sun

889
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,080
Hot, hot, let me

890
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,670
It's really warm and happy

891
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,360
Aunt Zhao

892
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,600
Compared with Junjun mentioned last time

893
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,870
In addition to your grief this time

894
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,430
A lot more love

895
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,180
As long as I think about it

896
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,040
When you are handsome

897
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,670
I really

898
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,760
It hurts here

899
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,870
But I have to think

900
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,870
Sometimes

901
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,320
I'm just a little sad

902
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,910
But

903
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,430
Heart does not hurt

904
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,670
Why do you think this is

905
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,430
That person used to be in your heart

906
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,600
Is it a very important person

907
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,470
How do you say

908
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,320
Maybe it was the time to leave me

909
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,390
Too long

910
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,870
More than twenty years

911
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,150
Longer than Junjun

912
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,430
Reason for too long

913
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,630
I remembered when she came

914
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,120
But I have no sadness

915
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,600
I will only think of some

916
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Very trivial things

917
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,000
Different attitudes towards death

918
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,760
There may be many reasons

919
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,230
Why don't you tell me more

920
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,630
Is she your friend?

921
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,470
Brothers

922
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,040
I sent the audience to US

923
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,800
Letters and gifts

924
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,630
I brought them back

925
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,520
Come and see, come and see

926
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,760
Come and have a look

927
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,120
So many letters

928
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,190
I have to see when to go

929
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,320
Many letters

930
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,120
We should be happy, okay

931
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,040
Happy

932
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,230
Teacher He

933
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,470
Is this for me

934
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,760
Teacher He

935
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,910
Look at this

936
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,910
It was sent to you at first sight

937
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,950
Fans now

938
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,950
Are you so careful

939
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,120
Give me a little monkey

940
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,760
Where is Anna's letter?

941
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,470
Do you have it?

942
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,950
I just asked the bar

943
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,280
Said not yet

944
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,710
It shouldn't be

945
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,670
By rights, this time

946
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,320
Should be here

947
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,000
I don't think so

948
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,840
Look for it again

949
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,080
Pretty Sister

950
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,040
What are you holding?

951
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,950
Don't take me

952
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,520
We're talking about Anna, sister

953
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,430
Come on, take a look at this

954
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,390
Voice of Gold Radio competition

955
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,080
How time flies!

956
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,560
The radio station is just like in previous years

957
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,360
Let time interview to participate in the competition

958
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,840
Sister, shouldn't you be

959
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,230
I signed up for you

960
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,520
Pan Tailai here

961
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,950
I found everyone is very energetic

962
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,670
And

963
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,840
Programs are also on the rise.

964
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,390
So I strive for one

965
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,230
Number of Entries

966
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,230
This is definitely an opportunity

967
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,230
It is also a challenge

968
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,270
We must not

969
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,000
Let the station down

970
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,760
So do the best

971
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,760
What I report to you is

972
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,000
The voice of gold is the highest

973
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,630
Classic Group

974
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
Just use Anna's program

975
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,950
The beginning of this story is so wonderful

976
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,360
You can't give me a chain at the end.

977
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,150
Yes

978
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,840
Sister, we haven't received it yet

979
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,760
Letter from Anna

980
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,080
Are you kidding me?

981
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,840
There are only a few days before the show is handed in.

982
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,710
Maybe it hasn't arrived yet

983
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,760
Shall we

984
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,870
Try to pass the program

985
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,760
See if I can get in touch

986
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,390
Sender
