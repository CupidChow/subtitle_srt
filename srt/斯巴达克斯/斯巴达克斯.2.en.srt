1
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,560
Wake.

2
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,900
You stand but first
crude brick, laying foundation

3
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,900
to the rise of
the house of Ashur.

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,320
All those before me shall fall.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,070
Enter the brothers Ferox!

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,610
Aargh!

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,990
That toad is pet to
Marcus fucking Crassus.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Apologies, Gabinius.
We did not think.

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,830
I shall redouble the effort to
secure undiscovered spectacle

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,290
and see rematch upon a day.

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,550
Let us gaze upon
glorious future.

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,050
Aargh! Pledge oath, call me
Dominus and fight in the arena.

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,090
Earn your freedom
upon the sands.

14
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,640
-  Achillia.
- Dominus.

15
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,910
Ay!

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,040
Tarchon! You lower
shield before you strike.

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,750
See it raised-
or your brains upon the sands.

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,630
Yes, Doctore.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,100
You fight with vigor.

20
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,270
Well, this house now
stands absent champion-

21
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,230
a position I would claim my own.

22
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,190
Well, to become champion,

23
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,360
you must first
defeat vaunted father.

24
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,990
A venture yet beyond grasp.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,620
For now, you withered corpse.

26
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,430
You mad fuck!

27
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,390
- You lower your guard.
- Towards good fucking reason.

28
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,090
We have felt the sting

29
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,010
of loss.

30
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,220
Witnessed honored champion

31
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,800
fall upon the sands of the arena

32
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,220
to the ill-thriven jackals
of Proculus.

33
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,980
Yet, as rising sun breaks dawn,

34
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,600
so too shall the House of Ashur

35
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,060
dispel darkest
night of indignity.

36
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,730
We shall no longer be bound
by the shackles of history

37
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,690
or fucking tradition!

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,950
We set foot upon
uncharted course

39
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,120
to satisfy the crowd's desire

40
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,910
with more exotic...

41
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,910
offerings.

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,750
But how shall rising
thirst be quenched?

43
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,500
There stands but one
capable of satiating

44
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,670
such ravenous mob!

45
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,050
Behold,

46
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,180
Achillia.

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,510
The Goddess of Death.

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,020
Silence fucking tongue,
and attend your Dominus!

49
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,570
Return to training,
you simple fucks.

50
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,030
Doctore,

51
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,530
see Achillia to instruction.

52
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,500
Dacus, sword and shield,
towards style of murmillo!

53
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,580
Yes, Doctore!

54
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,250
The woman bears resemblance
to my mother-

55
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,960
a spiteful fucking whore.

56
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,300
That explains much,
you witless shit.

57
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,220
- A fucking woman, father.
- Turn thoughts.

58
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,810
And raise guard!

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,640
Erato!

60
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,190
Pair with Achillia.

61
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,400
I would see cock tangle
with more worthy adversary.

62
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,150
Work the fucking log!

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,330
- Ay!
- Tarchon!

64
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,080
Pair with Achillia.

65
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,090
Yes, Doctore.

66
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,970
Shall I treat her as opponent

67
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,470
or something of
delicate persuasion?

68
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,890
A question I was of mind
to pose towards you.

69
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,980
See idle words give
way to clash of swords.

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,370
Begin!

71
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,670
She is of a form, is she not?

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,760
- Yes, Dominus.
- Mm-hm.

73
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,290
Aargh!

74
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,540
You have fought before,
yet not against such as I.

75
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,590
Fucking shield weights intent.

76
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,970
You will address me as Doctore.

77
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,940
Retrieve the shield.

78
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,770
It is not to my benefit,
Doctore.

79
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,940
You will
do as commanded!

80
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,410
Achillia,

81
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,240
stand ground.

82
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,000
And receive correction.

83
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,130
Dominus.

84
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,890
The moment has fucking passed.

85
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,020
Resume training.

86
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,330
Begin!

87
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,130
Aargh!

88
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,010
She does not grant respect
title of Doctore demands.

89
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,380
Respect is not granted;
it is taken.

90
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,140
Instruct Achillia in our ways

91
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,220
and see bared teeth give
way to averted gaze.

92
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,220
A lesson not easily
grasped by rabid dog.

93
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,770
Then respond with lash
until tongue laps at heel.

94
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,520
And what if beast
cannot be tamed?

95
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,860
Spartacus once stood as wild.

96
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,610
Yet by will and teachings
of Oenomaus,

97
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,280
he was domesticated

98
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,990
and became champion
of fucking Capua-

99
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,410
a result I would see mirrored.

100
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,070
She reflects but promise
of disappointment.

101
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,580
- Do you stand fucking Dominus?
- I do not.

102
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,120
Yet you bleat as if exalted
title cloaks you in such regard.

103
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,880
I account what eyes behold
through lens of experience.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,960
She is but fucking clay
for your hands to mold.

105
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,840
Forge her in the
fires of this ludus,

106
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,590
hardening her to swift purpose.

107
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,640
Swift? Achillia has but
only commenced training.

108
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,810
A thing of minor consequence.

109
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,140
I would see her ready for the
games of the Ludi Apollinares.

110
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,440
- You have secured position?
- I maneuver towards such.

111
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,610
So we but
clutch at fanciful dream.

112
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,900
As certain as waking
upon each fucking day,

113
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,910
I shall see it done and
claim desired contest against

114
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,820
the Brothers Ferox once more.

115
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,200
You wager all that crowd
will not turn upon us.

116
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,120
- For presenting novelty?
- For breaking tradition,

117
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,960
when fucking woman
takes to the sands.

118
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,080
Tradition is but
a word revered by those

119
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,540
who pursue mediocrity.

120
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,710
The House of Ashur
will carve its own path

121
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,920
and fuck into oblivion
all who stands in its way.

122
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,220
Dominus, message
has arrived from Rome.

123
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,930
Ah! At last.

124
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,890
Mighty Crassus deigns
to respond.

125
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,600
Apologies.
It is not from Crassus.

126
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,650
Who, then?

127
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,980
Julius fucking Caesar.

128
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,030
A man of no worth beyond name
granted by slipping

129
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,740
from mother's cunt.

130
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,120
He stands a quaestor, does he
not? A position of some note.

131
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,830
Fuck position.

132
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,830
Caesar flings his own shit and
declares it manna from heaven.

133
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,540
He breaks words
of some distress?

134
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,960
Some.

135
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,590
He sends us and our
men upon Appian Way,

136
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,180
towards unsavory task.

137
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,050
Do you not stand a free man,
as Caesar?

138
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,850
And as such,
not bound by request?

139
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,560
I stand free in the eye of
the republic, yet not in coin.

140
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,520
Crassus is honored patron
and Caesar his fucking will.

141
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,030
We must part lips and
swallow anointed cock.

142
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,090
Move cart further
from fucking nose.

143
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,280
It is a heavy sight...

144
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,780
to witness so many hearts no
longer beating beneath chest.

145
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,660
The rebel army that
shook the mighty republic

146
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,040
reduced to rotten flesh
beneath vengeful sun.

147
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,380
Shit cock!

148
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,300
We stand gladiators,
not common fucking slaves.

149
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,390
You stand as I fucking command!

150
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,440
Creticus has mind equal to
dazed child, yet breaks truth.

151
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,400
A gladiator's place
is upon the sands of the arena-

152
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,570
it is the duty of a quaestor
to tend to the Appian Way.

153
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,820
Caesar's tongue yet find
purchase in Crassus' ass.

154
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,160
We must endure one to
gain benefit of more-

155
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,330
Stop!

156
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
That mark-

157
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,880
this man stood Champion
of the House of Batiatus.

158
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,880
Gannicus.

159
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,180
Gannicus!
Gannicus! Gannicus!

160
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,640
I had occasion to cross
paths with him once,

161
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,600
after he claimed freedom
in the arena,

162
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,480
before he fell among Spartacus
and his rebels.

163
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,400
A drunken,
disagreeable fellow,

164
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,190
much to my liking.

165
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,900
He embraced his fate,
as all men must.

166
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,410
His death a kindness

167
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,030
to one forever haunted
by past transgressions.

168
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,750
- See him to fucking wagon.
- Dominus.

169
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,880
This man stood
a god of the arena,

170
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,220
his skill rivalled only by
the Bringer of Rain himself.

171
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,720
Two legends,
birthed from our ludus.

172
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,060
Yet we now stand absent even
lowly position in the games.

173
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,150
How far this fucking
house has fallen.

174
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,690
Come, come.

175
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,290
You desecrate these walls?

176
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,760
- I but enhance them.
- Mm.

177
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,010
This beast,

178
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,390
he is of your homeland?

179
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,600
Apedemak,

180
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,020
god of war and conquest.

181
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,310
You pray to him?

182
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,940
- He would not listen.
- Then why work his image?

183
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,610
- As a reminder.
- Towards?

184
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,610
What was lost.

185
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,910
Pause labor and take water.

186
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,470
- Gratitude.
- None required.

187
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,390
Your scars-

188
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,440
how did you come by them?

189
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,820
A tale not for one
so soft in form.

190
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,200
In battle?

191
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,280
When captured by the Romans?

192
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,700
I did not fall to
those fucking shits.

193
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,990
Marked by previous Dominus, then?

194
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,160
Towards instruction of manners?

195
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,870
I have never stood a slave.

196
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,080
Yet here in this house,
that is all you stand.

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,670
Lay hands upon Dominus again...

198
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,720
and I shall see you parted
from fucking life.

199
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,810
Little mouse squeaks,
and I'm to shudder in fear?

200
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,980
Make attempt and see talon
part head from body.

201
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,230
A certain end, if I were
to move against you openly.

202
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,570
Yet there are many
ways a clever mouse

203
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,490
may see vicious hawk to grass.

204
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,710
You taint fucking water?

205
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,630
I have not.

206
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,500
Yet at any moment,
I could snatch breath,

207
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,300
absent suspicion.

208
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,470
I shall leave you to your god,
who ignores your prayers.

209
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,070
Seize fucking mind!

210
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,330
- Doctore!
- Salvius!

211
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,870
Well deserved, you fu-!

212
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,960
- Enough!
- Fuck!

213
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,840
You fall to fucking quarrel!

214
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,380
Blood boiling in ear,

215
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,140
preventing voice of your Dominus
to pierce thick fucking skull!

216
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,600
Look upon your brothers.

217
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,730
They too defy their master

218
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,980
and now rot upon fucking cross.

219
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,900
Continue to inflame...

220
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,660
and see yourself
nailed among them.

221
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,580
You lose control.

222
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,710
The sun overheats passions,

223
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,420
already roiled by
Achillia's presence.

224
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,090
Fuck Jupiter's face.

225
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,430
It lifts heart, to witness your
men at last put to proper use.

226
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,940
I but serve the
republic on this day,

227
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,440
at request of revered Caesar.

228
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,570
Yet upon another,

229
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,860
I would present latest
acquisition in the arena

230
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,580
and have contest revisited
towards diminutive abortions.

231
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,290
At least we knew
our mother, you fucking cunt!

232
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,260
Descend from lofty perch and
broach subject of lineage again.

233
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,760
Hold! We are for Pompeii,
where we battle in the arena.

234
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,180
Let us leave the
House of Ashur to its labors-

235
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,390
in the dirt.

236
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,400
Form!

237
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,610
Is it fear

238
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,110
that stays hand from rematch
upon next games in Capua?

239
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,030
I welcome such entertainment.

240
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,700
- Mm.
- Yet station to decide

241
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,790
who shall fight and who shall
wallow in their own shit

242
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,580
falls not to me
but to good Gabinius.

243
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,870
Gabinius?

244
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,590
He hosts the game of
the Ludi Apollinares?

245
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,800
We are so honored.

246
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,590
Perhaps you may entreat
him towards your cause.

247
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,510
Or his beloved wife.

248
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,180
♪ Blood rains down
from an angry sky! ♪

249
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,650
♪ My cock rages on!
My cock rages on! ♪

250
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,520
♪ Till death is found,
my sword swinging hot! ♪

251
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,690
The gods you do not believe
in shit upon us once more.

252
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,610
They but present new obstacle.

253
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,700
Cossutia orchestrated
humiliation

254
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,570
and the fall of
our champion, Logas.

255
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,040
She will poison husband
towards granting position.

256
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,000
- Uvidus may yet hold sway.
- The aedile?

257
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,250
The man fears Crassus and may
provide necessary leverage.

258
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,800
Would not equal trepidation
fall towards Pompey,

259
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,130
whose favor Gabinius holds?

260
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,840
Set purpose towards
Achillia's training.

261
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,970
And leave machinations
towards greater fucking minds.

262
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,410
Good.

263
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,750
You yet reek of rotting
flesh from Appian Way.

264
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,550
I but smell as a man.

265
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
A man of piss and shit.

266
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,510
Doctore!

267
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,810
Perhaps the goddess of death
should fall to proper contest.

268
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,220
She would welcome
such a diversion.

269
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,020
A sentiment to be regretted.
Take position.

270
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,190
Dacus! Spear!

271
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,700
I shall fuck salted
words from mouth.

272
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,710
Do you borrow cock to do so?

273
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,710
Tarchon...

274
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,340
fall beside Creticus.

275
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,220
I'm to face two opponents?

276
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,430
Should the gods favor
you towards the arena,

277
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,930
you shall face three-

278
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,050
the Brothers Ferox.

279
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,060
Vicious half-men, pulled
from the ass of a rival lanista.

280
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,640
Half-men?

281
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,520
I could piss and they'd thank
the gods for rain.

282
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,980
She does not need sword
and shield, Doctore;

283
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,190
she'll cut them down
with fucking tongue.

284
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,610
Our honor stands
no fucking jest!

285
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,160
Nor do the Brothers Ferox.

286
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,580
Nature twisted them
into knotted lump.

287
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,120
And in their anger and pain,

288
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,410
they torment death
with aggrieved hands.

289
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,670
Misjudge them,
and see your life forfeit.

290
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,090
Take position.

291
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,930
Begin!

292
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,450
Focus on the one opponent and
invite fucking from the other.

293
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,620
Fucking shield again
prevents movement.

294
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,040
You face men, shield stands all
between you and the afterlife.

295
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,670
Again.

296
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,140
Tarchon!

297
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,730
Good!

298
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,690
Rid yourself of one adversary

299
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,320
so you may advance upon
other absent distraction.

300
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,450
You have not earned position
in this fucking house.

301
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,450
Aargh!

302
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,130
Disappointing.

303
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,510
Eat! We resume training
after heat of midday sun.

304
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,100
She is not absent skill.

305
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,980
She is absent honor,
striking Creticus upon manhood.

306
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,480
An unfortunate blow,
yet the fault is yours.

307
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,650
Mine?

308
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,450
Desire towards singular victory
left valued friend exposed.

309
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,280
Had this been the arena,
both of you would have fallen.

310
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,690
That's fucking shit.

311
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,200
Regain seat.

312
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,000
I did not spring from your cock,
nor am I bound by fucking voice.

313
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,630
The man presents
sharpened point.

314
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,010
Your sword will not
find purchase once more.

315
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,680
Why, do you never
intend to fight again?

316
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,390
Dogs eat from fucking ground.

317
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
Creticus!

318
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,900
You do not fight unless it
is upon my fucking command.

319
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,320
Apologies, Doctore.

320
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,870
I but remind the woman
of her place.

321
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,910
Return to training.

322
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,160
All of you!

323
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,600
Her presence incites
disobedience and distraction.

324
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,720
They cannot even break food
without falling to quarrel.

325
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,230
You pace like caged beast,

326
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,940
rending tranquil mood.

327
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,770
Apologies for disturbing
fucking bath.

328
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,360
Perhaps inflamed passion would
be cooled by soothing waters.

329
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,280
I prefer to bathe in solitude.

330
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,280
Yet you do not fucking stand so.

331
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,290
Wet cock and douse inferno

332
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,870
with wine.

333
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,710
Fill cup to overflowing.

334
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,440
Does sun break
through fucking cloud?

335
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,400
It makes attempt.

336
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,990
Achillia affords
rarest opportunity.

337
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,860
A sight never before
witnessed in the arena.

338
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,280
For good reason.

339
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,240
She does not belong
upon such sacred ground.

340
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,330
Accusation hurled at retiarius
when first introduced.

341
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,580
Net and trident,
how they laughed.

342
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,330
Yet now, not a game passes
absent their presence.

343
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,090
Tradition is but a novel rite,
aged to maturity.

344
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,380
A thing I would see Achillia
become.

345
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,760
She cannot triumph against
the Brothers Ferox.

346
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,510
No, she cannot...

347
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,760
yet.

348
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,430
You hold too much faith
in my instruction.

349
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,560
- I hold what is necessary.
- And what of the men?

350
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,600
They must embrace the future
or fall to memory.

351
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,650
They will never welcome
a woman as one of their own.

352
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,110
They need not to welcome her,
but they must fucking accept.

353
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,360
Right.

354
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,700
It is a bitter herb
you entreat them swallow.

355
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,330
Then let us see it honeyed
with wine and whores,

356
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,660
to balm injured fucking pride.

357
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,120
Such a gesture would aid in
calming gathering tempest.

358
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,380
With promise of more,
towards falling to reason.

359
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,300
Apologies, Dominus. Senator
Gabinius has sent messenger.

360
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,010
What word did he carry?

361
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,010
He insists message be delivered
only to your hands.

362
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,020
- Materialize the fucking man.
- Yes, Dominus.

363
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,980
The aedile champions
our cause to Gabinius?

364
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,730
I have yet opportunity
to broach subject.

365
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,490
- You stand Gabinius' man?
- Such is my charge.

366
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,950
Hand over, then.

367
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,390
Um, inform honored senator
what he requests is agreeable.

368
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,280
Gabinius invites me to
break meal at his villa!

369
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,360
To what purpose?

370
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,950
Unknown, yet I shall turn
it to fucking advantage.

371
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,200
Dominus has parted from sense.

372
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,250
As Achillia parted
you from yours.

373
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,210
It was but luck.

374
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,750
And trust fucking Nubian
held thread of honor.

375
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,040
You place blame where
it does not sleep.

376
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,130
You place fault in my efforts?

377
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,590
No.

378
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,050
Upon mine. I was absent thought
towards all but victory,

379
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,260
leaving you exposed.

380
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,100
I do not need you to come to
aid, you fucking shit.

381
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,390
Your cock says otherwise.

382
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,230
When paired in the arena,
you must fight as one.

383
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,730
Or fall divided.

384
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,650
And when were you last
upon the sands, old man?

385
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,990
A lifetime ago, yet I...

386
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,740
lived.

387
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,370
Which is a victory I fear
you may tumble well short of.

388
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,790
A thing of no pressing concern.

389
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,880
We are the House
of Piss and Shit,

390
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,380
denied opportunity
of glorious death.

391
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,880
Yours not so much,

392
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,220
assuming opponent stood
greater than small child.

393
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,510
Fill air with fucking laughter,

394
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,810
as Capua does upon thought
of this fucking house.

395
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,770
It is what we make it.

396
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,770
See weighted spirits lifted.

397
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,110
Your Dominus presents
gift of wine and whores.

398
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,110
Well, perhaps the gods yet
favor this fucking House!

399
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,570
Now remove yourselves

400
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,870
so Achillia may bathe
absent lingering gaze.

401
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,250
Whores!

402
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,660
Wine and whores!

403
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,470
He preens as if I've never
witnessed cock bared and wet.

404
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,380
Attend yourself and retire
to cell for the night.

405
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,850
Am I not to enjoy the pleasures
of wine and whores?

406
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,980
Such rewards are reserved
for those who bear the mark

407
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
of the brotherhood.

408
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,810
An honor you have yet to earn.

409
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,620
- Perhaps this one.
- You possess discerning eye.

410
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,000
As I wish yours
to such this night.

411
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,710
I am to Gabinius' villa,
not the arena.

412
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,960
Does Cossutia yet
stand his wife?

413
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,470
As Cerberus guarding
gate of the underworld,

414
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,470
frothing and snapping.

415
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,220
The target of my concern.

416
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,930
She holds no sway,
absent command of husband.

417
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,430
And if she has moved him
to her cause against you?

418
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,480
Cheeks spread for
deeper ramming.

419
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,650
- Then why accept invitation?
- I hold no fucking choice!

420
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,110
Calm troubled thoughts
and realize,

421
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,370
all men of power and position
underestimate Ashur at own...

422
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,750
fucking peril.

423
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,460
Prepare yourself for my return.

424
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,750
You as well.

425
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,600
You worry over him
beyond reason.

426
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,560
He is our Dominus.

427
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,480
Our fates tethered to his.

428
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,730
Yet who worries over you?

429
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,440
Hmm?

430
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,740
Turn mind to task and
see linens freshened,

431
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,830
in anticipation of
his triumphant return.

432
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,010
Senator Gabinius
shall join presently.

433
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,030
Ah! Here is our man.

434
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,700
Gratitude for
accepting invitation

435
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,110
upon briefest of notice.

436
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,200
I am swelled by august request.

437
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
You are familiar
with cherished wife?

438
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,790
We are so acquainted.

439
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,830
In passing,
in the streets, if I recall.

440
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,330
Apologies for our delay.

441
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,130
This business with the Cilician
pirates

442
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,590
vexes all affected
by their savage attacks.

443
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,050
Locusts plaguing
our beloved republic.

444
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,800
I pray harsh retribution awaits.

445
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,180
We are of singular mind.

446
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,640
I draft motion in the Senate...

447
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,560
to see menace quelled by
able hand of trusted Pompey.

448
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,230
Pompey?

449
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,360
He takes leave
from Rome with his army?

450
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,980
A small portion,
adequate to task.

451
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,610
The remainder counterbalanced

452
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,400
towards fighting men
loyal to Crassus.

453
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,080
May the gods usher
Pompey to victory,

454
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,910
as Scipio Africanus against
Hannibal at the gates.

455
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,250
You are schooled
in our histories?

456
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,330
I am but babe,
crawling through dewy morn.

457
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,960
Then let us see you rise
upon legs of knowledge,

458
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,710
and stride upright as
all men in midday of life.

459
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,630
Hmm. Some yet stumble
upon attempt,

460
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,180
skull bashed upon
unforgiving ground.

461
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,180
I shall strive to
remain surefooted.

462
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,230
As most reliable goat.

463
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,400
Let us not veer
towards pointed meaning.

464
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,610
I would have all slights,
genuine or fanciful,

465
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,110
fall to past remembrance.

466
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,570
- Memory has faded to obscurity.
- Never to return.

467
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,990
Apologies.

468
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,910
Voices stirred interest.

469
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,950
Viridia. It swells heart
to see you stir from chambers.

470
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,660
Effort rarely
taken these days.

471
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,250
Perhaps you might return after
our esteemed guest has departed.

472
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,830
Is this him?

473
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,040
The Syrian?

474
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,630
You are not properly
dressed to receive-

475
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,260
Are these the hands?

476
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,640
The ones that saw
Spartacus to deserved end?

477
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,640
They, uh...

478
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,060
T-they but aided

479
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,480
in the effort.

480
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,860
Gratitude.

481
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,860
Rome is forever in your debt.

482
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,240
- As am I.
- Hour grows late.

483
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,280
Retire to bath with loving
mother so I may break words

484
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,700
with honored guest
absent distraction.

485
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:09,130
Come. Let us leave
the men to their folly.

486
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,260
Forgive my daughter.
She holds not herself.

487
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,930
What affliction troubles her?

488
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,310
The most grievous,
a wounded heart.

489
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,430
Her husband, much beloved,

490
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,770
fell to Spartacus and his
rebels at Sinuessa en Valle,

491
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,560
where he broached business
with Laurus, the trader.

492
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:36,240
Such loss sees the strongest of
us absent mind when in its grip.

493
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,240
Well formed.

494
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,320
Yet,

495
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,410
let us turn from shadowed past

496
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,830
in favor of
more promising days.

497
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,910
Yes.

498
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,520
You stand well satisfied,
old friend?

499
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,070
Oh, I stand a fucking god.

500
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,530
Do not fucking stop.

501
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,000
Throw dice, Salvius!

502
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,630
Bow to the champion
of fucking dice!

503
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,340
Yet not a champion of fucking!

504
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,490
Then I shall make
you see the prince.

505
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,950
You deprive release
of hardened cock!

506
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,910
Shall deprive you of
fucking teeth as well.

507
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,750
- Tarchon.
- The girl is mine.

508
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,250
See humble offering
inserted elsewhere.

509
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,220
I favor more heft
to ass anyway.

510
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,260
Oh, Hedylus completes chore.
Well, I shall swim upstream.

511
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,360
You would pull me from services
purchased by your Dominus?

512
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,870
I would wrest you
from Mars himself.

513
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,660
You warm heart, Elata.
As sun above the earth below.

514
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,460
You flatter,
as all men stiff of cock.

515
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,930
I know that you're forced to lie
with men outside these walls.

516
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,260
Yet within them, I would have no
other hands upon you but mine.

517
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,020
Then lay them upon me.

518
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,680
You were commanded
to remain in your cell.

519
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,930
Slumber eludes with
all the fucking noise

520
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,640
and noise of fucking.

521
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,280
What do you see?

522
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,940
I do not grasp meaning.

523
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,900
When you strike,
what do you see?

524
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,530
A wooden fucking man.

525
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,370
You unleash fury
beyond simple form.

526
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,210
What do you see, in mind's eye?

527
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,010
Those who hold me unworthy.

528
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,840
Within this ludus

529
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,090
or upon the path
that led you to such fate?

530
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,940
You do not partake in the
pleasure of whores denied me?

531
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,860
My taste is of a more
discerning nature.

532
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,160
One not sated by men
who accept coin,

533
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,370
in exchange for loving embrace.

534
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,370
Hmm. Would that I were
so blessed of choice.

535
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,630
Hmm.

536
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,130
Drink

537
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,430
and dull pain of coming days.

538
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,850
You lower yourself, speaking
to the Syrian as you did.

539
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,400
I but expressed gratitude,
keenly felt.

540
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,110
You made him feel as equal,
deserving of such praise.

541
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,570
Does he not, for aiding
in the fall of Spartacus?

542
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,410
He but aided himself and desire
to climb above his station.

543
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,250
Should not all men
seek to be so elevated?

544
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,120
Yes, if they are
of proper breeding.

545
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,290
You froth as if
personally aggrieved.

546
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,840
The man himself
is of slightest note.

547
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,460
It is what he represents-

548
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,590
those who would pollute pure
waters of the republic,

549
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,180
fancying themselves upon level
with storied name and position.

550
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,470
He must be made example,
to be taken as warning

551
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,890
to all those who would
mistake themselves so.

552
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,020
Father appears in disagreement.

553
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,850
Husband will often stray from
reason, if not closely attended.

554
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,820
Would that I yet had one
to give such counsel.

555
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,740
Accept mine...

556
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,240
in his place.

557
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,790
Do not forfeit precious
youth to grieving.

558
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,380
- Wound is yet fresh.
- And...

559
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,000
will never heal...

560
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,800
unless proper balm is applied.

561
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,510
Life does not end when
a husband falls from this world.

562
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,720
Nor heart remained sundered,

563
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,060
when cradled
in hands of loving mother.

564
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,730
Tell me, Syrian,

565
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,570
were you and your family
brought to Rome as slaves?

566
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,570
I alone. Mother and
sister fell to disease,

567
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,700
long before I fled Tigranes'
army and found myself, uh...

568
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,580
guest of the republic.

569
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,870
And your father?

570
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,080
I hold no memory of him.

571
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,250
Absence of such robs
a boy of proper direction.

572
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,470
You must truly hold
favor of your gods,

573
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,340
to find yourself elevated from
slave to current position

574
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,550
of Dominus of own fucking house.

575
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,100
I am indeed blessed,

576
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,810
yet by labor of own hands

577
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,390
and accomplishments
beholden only to them.

578
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,480
You hold no belief in the
divinity guiding mortal man?

579
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,570
My Dominus was known
for oft-repeated refrain,

580
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,950
one which I yet admire-

581
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,150
"Fuck the gods."

582
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,120
And to what end did
such sentiment lead?

583
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,290
Most unfortunate one.

584
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,040
Well, one man's misfortune often
falls to another's opportunity.

585
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,750
How unseemly a role
did your hands play

586
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,130
in manufacturing such?

587
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,800
I have done...

588
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,170
questionable things...

589
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,220
to arrive where I now sit.

590
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,640
Who of worth can
claim otherwise?

591
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,520
And now?

592
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,810
Upon this day?

593
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,900
- I walk a different path.
- Oh.

594
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,070
So the tiger has
altered stripes?

595
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,940
I am not the man I once was.

596
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,400
Nor the man you
yet desire to be.

597
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,030
You are but faint specter,

598
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,830
caught between two worlds
you do not belong in.

599
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,960
It is a heavy thing, is it not,
to be burdened with dreams

600
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,290
made sudden reality?

601
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,590
I am but a humble servant
of the republic.

602
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,720
Why would you swear
allegiance to a republic

603
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,430
that despises you?

604
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,970
Why lavish tongue upon those who
yet hold you in naked contempt?

605
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,480
You shall never stand equal
in their eyes,

606
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,480
forever condemned to be
but rough-hewn tool to be used

607
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,280
till blade is dulled
by unkind years, then...

608
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,030
cast aside.

609
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,080
What worth is a knife...

610
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,040
if it lies absent use?

611
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,630
So, mighty Crassus continues
to sharpen intent, then?

612
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,880
All the way from where
he sits, with his army,

613
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,510
outside the gates of Rome?

614
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,550
We are as one, via messenger
upon regular basis.

615
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,890
Only a fool relies upon
the benevolence of the rich.

616
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,850
Their whims counsel but
their own reflection.

617
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,360
Coin afforded by
Crassus admittedly thins

618
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,940
with passing of days,
yet debt mounts-

619
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:21,280
water, grain, equipment.
My stock drains fortune.

620
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,620
And with it,
hope of grander aspiration

621
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,830
towards the games in the arena.
A subject I would broach-

622
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:29,700
You refer to your gladiators
as stock?

623
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,370
Do they not carry title of men?

624
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,920
They are but slaves.

625
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,050
As you once stood.

626
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,460
A distant memory.

627
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,970
Yet forgotten by none.

628
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,600
Let eyes fall upon it.

629
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,440
Your brand,

630
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,230
marking you as property
of the House of Batiatus-

631
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,820
I would lay eyes.

632
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,790
Oh.

633
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,630
Rumor proves truth.

634
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:23,590
Crassus growls command, and
loyal cur gnaws its own flesh.

635
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,180
Words fell from
less noble heights.

636
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,150
Gaius Claudius Glaber
gave command,

637
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,440
before he was dispatched from
this world by Spartacus himself,

638
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,610
in the shadow

639
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,530
of Vesuvius.

640
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,900
I had occasion to break meal
with Glaber upon a time.

641
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:49,030
A most unsettling cast
of eye, absent blink-

642
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,790
as a lizard,
encumbered with human form.

643
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,580
A most uncanny assessment
of the man.

644
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,080
And how gauge you
the measure of the one you see

645
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,710
seated before you?

646
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,670
No, come, hold me as friend.

647
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,220
Well, as semblance of such,
as the moment requires.

648
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,390
I see a most noble Roman, well
regarded by deed and tongue-

649
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,430
Flattery is of little worth

650
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,270
to one laden with
coin and privilege!

651
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:19,190
I would have from you
what others withhold-

652
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,900
the fucking truth!

653
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,580
I see a man of fading years...

654
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,040
clinging to what time remains,

655
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,330
in hopes of preserving tradition
of beloved republic.

656
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,000
Yet many within it increasingly

657
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,050
find him more annoyance
than benefit,

658
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,880
save for those of low position
who seek the borrowing of coin.

659
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,890
I see a man possessed
of serpent-tongued wife...

660
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,020
who maneuvers
beyond his interests.

661
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,780
Words well broken.

662
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,790
Now fall from fucking sight
and remain so removed.

663
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,230
Form improves.

664
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:45,020
Moves from watery shit to firm.

665
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,800
Wooden man poses slight contest.

666
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,890
Perhaps you would care to engage
more fearsome opponent.

667
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,470
I prefer larger challenge.

668
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,350
Fuck what you prefer, woman.

669
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,820
Stay down, you fucking cunt!

670
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,950
Aargh!

671
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,560
The woman at last
finds her place-

672
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,470
on her back,

673
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,310
with legs spread.

674
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,610
Hold her!
You fucking cunt!

675
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,910
Aargh!

676
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,130
Aargh!

677
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,550
Fucking bitch!

678
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,180
Aargh!

679
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,270
Aargh!

680
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,770
Aargh!

681
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,570
Aargh!

682
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,890
Medicus!

683
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,600
- Medicus!
- The man, at last,

684
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,730
finds his place-
legs spread, absent cock.

685
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:28,190
Medicus! Aargh!

686
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,810
Medicus!

687
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,240
Ephesius? Why is he
so stained with blood?

688
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,780
Give way! Give...

689
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,580
fucking... way!

690
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,540
Life has fled.

691
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,840
A blessing for one
so rudely handled.

692
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,130
What has fucking happened?

693
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,220
The woman!

694
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,090
She went mad!

695
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,300
He breaks false words.

696
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,470
I was but working palus,
when they-

697
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,640
I give no shit what they did.

698
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,770
Only the Dominus of the house
can claim life of one who stands

699
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,480
among the brotherhood.

700
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,270
Any man who lays hands upon
me shall fall the same fate,

701
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,690
regardless of fucking brand.

702
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,280
- She does not belong here!
- Do not speak!

703
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,910
You believe you
hold place among us?

704
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,660
I did not ask to be
in this fucking house,

705
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,950
Yet I stand equal
as any man within it.

706
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,200
Then give proof.

707
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,370
Dacus! Steel.

708
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,420
We must stop this.
I will alert villa guards.

709
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,630
Hold.

710
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,420
She makes bold claim.

711
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:39,260
Let us see it defended.

712
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,220
Doctore, should this matter
not be attended by Dominus?

713
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:47,890
Fall from fucking side.

714
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,980
- Korris.
- Hold ground.

715
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,530
Or Dominus will hear you took
wine and fell from fucking post.

716
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,410
Retrieve the shield
and take position.

717
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,840
You stand for
a man absent honor?

718
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,760
I stand for the brotherhood.

719
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,050
Then thank the gods
I am not a part of it.

720
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,660
Make her
suffer the point!

721
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:47,740
Fight her now!

722
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,830
Retreat as a coward would.
Coward!

723
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,420
For the brotherhood!

724
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,170
You have learned nothing!

725
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,550
Except how to die absent honor.

726
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,720
Doctore, kill her!

727
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,470
Fire will not aid you!

728
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:24,910
Aargh!

729
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,620
Die!

730
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,080
Yes!

731
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,670
Send her to the fuckin
afterlife.

732
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:47,090
Increase advantage, Doctore!

733
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,100
Finish her.

734
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,400
For our brother!

735
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,570
Fucking kill her!

736
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,040
You fought well, yet fall
short of the brotherhood.

737
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,900
I stand mistaken.

738
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,750
She took the life of a brother,
yet you let her live?

739
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,540
I am the champion of Akragas.

740
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,210
Freedom won upon the sand,
by my own fucking will.

741
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,340
And yet this woman,
absent experience,

742
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,550
has achieved what none
among you could dare dream of-

743
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,260
she drew blood

744
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,680
against opponent far outmatching
her in skill and experience.

745
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,270
She has earned my respect...

746
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,060
if but for fleeting moment.

747
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:26,280
And any man who lays
undesired hand upon her...

748
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,570
shall feel my own...

749
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,530
at fucking throat.
