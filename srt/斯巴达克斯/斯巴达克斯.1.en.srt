1
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,520
Spartacus.

2
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,320
There's movement upon the path.

3
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,130
Ashur!

4
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,600
A man must accept his fate...

5
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,730
...or be destroyed by it.

6
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,340
Ashur. Ashur. Ashur.

7
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,140
Your life was
forfeit upon Vesuvius,

8
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,360
taken by one to whom
you have done grave injustice.

9
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,650
And now here you kneel, joining
your domina and her child

10
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,280
among the dead
in the Underworld.

11
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,280
At what measure of a man
stood you

12
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,120
when heart beat within chest?

13
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,790
A Syrian

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,210
despised by all;

15
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,040
a slave to my husband,
Batiatus...

16
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,800
a gladiator...

17
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,720
...ever so briefly
upon the sands of the arena...

18
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,930
...elevated to
trusted conspirator,

19
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,520
valued for your gifts
of cunning and deceit.

20
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,480
And when the
House of Batiatus fell

21
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,940
to the mad Thracian Spartacus
and his rebels...

22
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,030
Kill them all!

23
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,110
...you turned against
your brothers...

24
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,570
aiding Roman masters -

25
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,530
an attempt to bring
rebellious slaves to heel.

26
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,790
And yet you had already fallen
well in advance of Spartacus,

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,170
being struck from the world
of the living by Roman spears.

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,710
Yet the Fates
weave many threads.

29
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,720
Your untimely passing
was but single path

30
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,720
of what might have been.

31
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,930
Do you desire to bear witness
to another?

32
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,020
A new reality,

33
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,060
uncoupled from history...

34
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,270
where you did not perish
upon Vesuvius,

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,520
where instead you aligned
with mighty Crassus,

36
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,230
the richest man
in all the Republic,

37
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,940
and his dog of war,

38
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,530
Gaius Julius Caesar.

39
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,870
A path where you hurled
fatal spear

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,620
that claimed the life
of Spartacus...

41
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,040
...and, in the act,
saved Crassus,

42
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,790
who rewards you
with patronage...

43
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,010
and all that once belonged
to my noble husband.

44
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,180
Embrace the path
the gods have set you upon.

45
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,300
Do you desire
to know where that fate

46
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,430
would have led?

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,010
Awake, then...

48
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,640
The gods have
brought you this far.

49
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,020
...and embrace a life
that might have been.

50
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,020
I believe
we are not done with you yet.

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,060
Wake!

52
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,200
Dominus?

53
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,370
Are you unwell?

54
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,410
A fleeting dream...

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,040
born of unfortunate meal in
advance of slumber.

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,250
What did Morpheus reveal
upon his shores?

57
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,920
It...

58
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,300
It...

59
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,310
eludes grasp of waking mind.

60
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,650
A thing of no importance.

61
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,280
Bring food...

62
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,860
and wine.

63
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,200
I will greet morning sun.

64
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,580
And what fortunes it carries.

65
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,160
Ha!

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,150
Halt!

67
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,830
Second position.

68
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,540
Begin!

69
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,420
Watch footing,
you fucking woman.

70
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,630
Watch tongue, you fucking cunt.

71
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,970
Logas!

72
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,350
Tarchon!

73
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,390
Use your mind!

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,020
Get him off!

75
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,650
Yes!

76
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,940
Doctore!

77
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,440
Form the men.

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,700
I would have words.

79
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,990
Attend.

80
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,710
You act as child

81
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,670
with shit running down your leg.

82
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,340
I act as my father would...

83
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,550
in his youth.

84
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,840
I should have never laid
with your mother.

85
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,000
What... is beneath your feet?

86
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,500
Sacred ground
watered with tears of blood.

87
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,250
No,

88
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,630
you simple fuck.

89
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,090
What lies beneath your feet
is opportunity -

90
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,430
for coin,

91
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,180
and the respect
such bounty presents.

92
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,940
And...

93
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,690
glory in the arena.

94
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,320
You stand but first crude brick
laying foundation

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,610
to the rise of
the House of Ashur!

96
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,990
To ascend, you must train absent
mirth or breaking of laughter.

97
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,790
You must commit flesh to
being forged into semblance

98
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,330
of the gods...

99
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,870
to honor the man

100
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,670
who brought down
the mighty Spartacus himself.

101
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,090
You find issue in such thought?

102
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,470
Apologies, Dominus.

103
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
Break words,
absent threat of reprisal.

104
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,310
Rumor bends ear.

105
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,230
Speak...
and see it straightened.

106
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,520
That you

107
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,570
hurled spear at
the bringer of rain

108
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,030
while his back was
yet towards you.

109
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,250
Perhaps you think your dominus

110
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,000
unworthy

111
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,670
opponent.

112
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,840
Bring me gladius.

113
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,800
Dacus.

114
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,640
No.

115
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,020
I would see wood
give way to steel.

116
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,540
Dominus strays from reason.

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,840
No.

118
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,970
He but corrects those
beneath him.

119
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,590
Well?

120
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,300
Begin.

121
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,770
Advantage of size means little
when countered with skill

122
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,190
and mind

123
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,320
fleet of purpose.

124
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,540
He shifts weight to right leg,
signaling intent.

125
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,130
Agh!

126
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,630
He gathers breath
before assault.

127
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,350
Again, signaling intent.

128
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,480
Give way to emotions,

129
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,980
and fall upon the sands
of the arena,

130
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,860
presenting ass for fucking.

131
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,700
That...

132
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,790
was Falernian.

133
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,670
And I was deemed lowest
among the Brotherhood

134
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,930
by most vexing doctore serving
my own dominus, Batiatus.

135
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,350
Yet even the lowest
of a gladiator

136
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,520
stands colossus

137
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,640
in regards to common men.

138
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,230
Grasp words to fucking breast...

139
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,190
or see heart torn from it.

140
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,910
Bury him where he lies
so I may water grave

141
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,870
with pressing need
of each morning's piss.

142
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,640
Grain delivery has been delayed.

143
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,350
Cilicians fell upon ship
and transport.

144
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,890
I've instructed Messia
to ration what we yet hold

145
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,560
while other arrangements
can be secured.

146
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,940
What of dispatches from Rome?
Have any been received?

147
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,450
No, Dominus.

148
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,780
See to the day's work, Hilara.

149
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,790
And inform delicate
fucking artist

150
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,040
to finish labors by nightfall!

151
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,590
Or see hammer and chisel
turn upon master.

152
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,750
Ashur!

153
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,550
I would have fucking words.

154
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,520
Have you lost fucking sense?!
He was a man of great worth

155
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,430
who held promise
towards fucking arena!

156
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,850
I will not be addressed in
such tone, you fucking goat.

157
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,440
Cease tongue and see passions
cool to more pleasing breeze.

158
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,860
Apologies.
Yet words carry sting of truth.

159
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,120
The man's demise
will be keenly felt.

160
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,740
So shall lesson imparted
upon remaining stock.

161
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,620
There are less permanent ways
of motivating them.

162
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,920
Then why have you not summoned

163
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,290
such mystical powers
of persuasion?

164
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,630
My doctore opens mouth,
yet shit spews forth.

165
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,090
I am not one of
your fucking slaves

166
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,050
and shall not be treated
as such.

167
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,970
I am a free man,

168
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,010
an honor earned by
my victories in the arena.

169
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,930
No man is truly free if he yet
finds himself in need of coin.

170
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,850
You are well paid
for your services.

171
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,980
But if you hold belief
a man of your advanced years

172
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,020
may obtain a better position
in another ludus,

173
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,440
let us part

174
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,440
fucking ways.

175
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,370
I do not care for you.

176
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,710
Nor I you.

177
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,540
Yet we are bound

178
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,840
by need.

179
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,260
Let us see our fortunes
rise as one

180
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,550
and forge a path

181
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,510
towards less
tempestuous relations.

182
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,640
Your will, my hands.

183
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,140
Our hands.

184
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,320
Gather yourself.
We attend the games.

185
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,320
We gain position
to finally present our men?

186
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,410
No.

187
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,580
But words strike
to heart of intent.

188
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,730
Yeah!

189
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,490
Fucking war hammer?!

190
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,870
Thraex should be paired
against spear of hoplomachus

191
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,660
- or sword of murmillo.
- Attend the crowd.

192
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,040
They give no shit
towards tradition.

193
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,690
A fine showing,

194
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,570
yet the gods bless us

195
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,160
with even greater spectacle

196
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,280
for primus

197
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,450
to conclude the day,

198
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,000
to honor Capua

199
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,040
and most deserving citizens!

200
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,500
Good Opiter

201
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,170
has seen fit to present
most glorious offering.

202
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,630
Come on!

203
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,970
Enter Pluton - hoplomachus!

204
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Make it hurt!

205
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,440
Yeah!

206
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,860
Who shall face
such formidable opponent?

207
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,980
There can stand only one!

208
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,490
- From the House of Proculus...
-  Ooooh...

209
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,540
...enter Ammonius -

210
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,120
murmillo!

211
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,590
Ha ha!

212
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,850
Your man is well received,
Proculus!

213
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,470
He but claims laurels
rightfully due.

214
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,640
Perhaps the House of Opiter

215
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,020
shall present
surprising challenge.

216
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,270
Would that voice graced with
such beauty entreat the heavens.

217
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,530
Mmm.

218
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,660
May the Gods

219
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,250
favor our offerings.

220
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,120
Begin!

221
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,030
See how Ammonius draws his
opponent in, lending false hope.

222
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,750
Yes!

223
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,960
He wields not only strength
but sharpened strategy.

224
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,210
Shall I seek to arrange
for you to swallow his cock

225
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,130
upon contest's end?

226
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,510
The man stands unrivalled
upon the sands.

227
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,930
It would be an honor to drink
such potent a blessing.

228
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,980
He is of form.

229
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,110
If we can conjure an opponent
of equal worth...

230
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,730
Oof!

231
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,840
Jupiter himself would have
to grace us with champion

232
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,300
to give Ammonius
slightest of pause.

233
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,390
Come. Let us set foot upon path

234
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,270
and see you proved
short of fucking sight.

235
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,610
A most welcome diversion,

236
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,700
easing encumbrance of
ill-natured concerns.

237
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,240
It lifts heart to hear it so,
Cossutia. Let us--

238
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,450
Aedile!

239
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,910
Ah!

240
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,080
I would seize moment
and beseech word.

241
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,250
You accost me in the street now,
Syrian, as common cutpurse?

242
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,050
Apologies. I was unable
to secure audience

243
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,050
through traditional means
and took initiative

244
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,140
- through brighter prospects.
- The man flaunts savage nature

245
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,180
and presents it as
shrewd navigation.

246
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,850
Let us not stand
in too harsh a reply.

247
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,520
Did the Syrian not help
quell rebellion,

248
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,230
turning upon his own
in the effort?

249
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,150
Such is said through
parted lips and eager tongue.

250
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,770
I but serve the Republic.

251
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,820
As does my husband -
at times, to distraction.

252
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,820
- His absence most deeply felt.
- Mm.

253
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,660
Duties yet hold him in Rome?

254
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,620
He counsels Pompey in attempt
to soothe inflamed relations

255
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,120
with Crassus.

256
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,830
Crassus yet stands
your patron, does he not,

257
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,250
gifting you position
and Batiatus' ludus?

258
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,710
I stand so blessed...
for services rendered.

259
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,170
Then surely you have his ear
in the matter.

260
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,470
I have dispatched messages
regarding variety of

261
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,140
pressing concerns,
not least among them

262
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,720
rebuilding once mighty arena
brought to ruin

263
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,720
- by Spartacus and his rebel--
- Yes, a lofty ideal,

264
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,680
to be sure.

265
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,650
Please give Crassus our wishes
for continued prosperity.

266
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,150
If you shout them loud enough,

267
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,910
perhaps they will reach
all the way to Rome, hm?

268
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,040
Uvidus!

269
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,000
Aedile. I would broach subject
for position in future games.

270
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,300
Position? Word travels upon wind
of your men being... less than.

271
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,550
I assure you, they stand equal
to any good Proculus

272
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,100
- could hope to offer.
- Korris speaks out of turn...

273
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,600
yet breaks truth.

274
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,100
Let us grace the Syrian
with reward equal to worth -

275
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,940
if not swayed by my desire, then
in name of honored husband?

276
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,280
Very well.

277
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,440
One man...
to be presented mid-month

278
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,490
upon festival of Liber Pater.

279
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,570
I eagerly await the day.

280
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,950
As do I.

281
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,130
Did I not tell
you? We at last gain position!

282
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,180
If you'd bowed any lower, your
mouth would be filled with dirt.

283
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,260
And I would gorge until
bursting to gain advantage.

284
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,060
Who stands most
well-honed among our men?

285
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,230
Rhodius, by wide fucking margin.

286
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,310
Rhodius? Which man is he?

287
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
The one you buried this morning.

288
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,370
You did not think
to broach subject

289
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,500
before I fell
the fucking man?!

290
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,210
I warned his absence
would be keenly felt.

291
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,540
After deed had been done!

292
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh, apologies... for not
divining future where you

293
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:26,170
fell from reason and took life
with jug of fucking wine!

294
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,810
We have opportunity, Korris,
and we must seize it.

295
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,940
Pit man against man
at break of dawn.

296
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,030
Whoever triumphs by
fall of night shall stand

297
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,990
our champion in the arena.

298
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,990
- Your will--
- Go!

299
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,740
- Dominus.
- What?!

300
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,540
Apologies.

301
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,000
I thought you might take food.

302
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,830
And perhaps warm bath.

303
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,880
To temper mood.

304
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Is it so foul a creature?

305
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,720
For enraged bull?

306
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,090
- No.
- Mm.

307
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,720
Lead way.

308
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,100
And I shall attempt not to gore

309
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,810
with errant horn.

310
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,030
What troubled thoughts
lend burden?

311
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,870
None of worth.

312
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,130
Place them upon scale to be
weighted by a less critical eye.

313
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,090
Many nights I would lay in
my cell below us in the ludus,

314
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,720
dreaming...

315
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,140
of a day I would
hold title of dominus.

316
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,430
Absent concern to onus
such title carried.

317
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,560
Did former dominus
share in reflection?

318
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,360
Batiatus?

319
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,320
The man stood
constantly pressed,

320
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,820
believing the gods themselves
spread cheeks

321
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,780
for frequent ramming.

322
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,580
And how did he survive?

323
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,670
Through cunning and deception.

324
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,090
Benefit of my aid

325
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,430
at every turn.

326
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,970
Then you shall rise

327
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,930
through conviction
of your own counsel...

328
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,570
...as your cock

329
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,480
heralds way.

330
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,120
Ah!

331
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,500
Shall I summon Messia
to join us?

332
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,840
No.

333
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,720
I have desire
for sweeter nectar.

334
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,560
Wash day's bitter taste...

335
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,560
...from mouth.

336
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,490
Bless the gods. We...

337
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,740
are for the arena!

338
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,080
You are for fucking shit, Erato.

339
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,250
You fare no better.

340
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,170
Place lips upon hole so I may
impart more cloying breath

341
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,790
than breaks from fucking mouth!

342
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,460
Oh, Tarchon.

343
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,800
Your boy stands absent
sense or concern.

344
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,300
And you did not fall into
quarrel during day's training?

345
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,390
Passions overwhelmed
upon the moment.

346
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,010
I should not have
lashed out at my brothers...

347
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,850
when true enemy stands Roman.

348
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,270
-  Oooh.
- Logas!

349
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,520
- Oh, let him speak.
- Towards what end?

350
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,980
Of us fucking all

351
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,360
if whimpering growl
reaches ear of our dominus.

352
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,530
- The Syrian?
- Mm?

353
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,070
He stands a traitor
to the Brotherhood -

354
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,990
something well known
to Spartacus.

355
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,870
You would see us all nailed
upon cross along Appian Way.

356
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,960
I would see us
slip from beneath heel.

357
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,460
What Spartacus began
lives in the spirit

358
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,420
of those who followed him.
And rumors

359
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,010
the man himself

360
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,550
may yet live.

361
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,840
If he yet drew breath,

362
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,260
the Bringer of Rain
would make presence known.

363
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,760
No, no, no.
More likely the mad fuck

364
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,690
forever slumbers in unknown beds
beneath fetid ground.

365
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,900
Tarchon,

366
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,440
fall to my side

367
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,360
and let us remove ourselves
from such foolishness.

368
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,330
You clear fucking room.

369
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,330
We are better served
in their absence.

370
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,580
The lesson of Spartacus
is well learned...

371
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,080
for those who dare embrace it.

372
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,420
What fucking lesson?
To die at the end of spear?

373
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,050
That freedom is worth any cost,

374
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,220
as is claiming the life
of those who would oppress us.

375
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,510
Whoever stands upon
the sands of the arena

376
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,180
will have the opportunity
in victory

377
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,220
to shed the blood of our dominus

378
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,730
and every Roman cock
he kneels to suck.

379
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,200
You have been granted
the greatest of honor

380
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,370
to at last grace
the sands of the arena!

381
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,500
To prove yourselves against the
shit, Proculus, and his men.

382
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,750
Some...

383
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,750
would claim you've been

384
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,380
blessed by the gods.

385
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,960
Fuck the gods!

386
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,720
They give no shit
towards the affairs of men,

387
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,010
a thing I have witnessed
countless times as a gladiator,

388
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,100
as a soldier...

389
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,560
as a free man.

390
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,150
We forge our own fate

391
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,150
with our hands,

392
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,780
with our will,

393
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,820
and with our blood!
Prove yourselves worthy -

394
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,990
not to Jupiter
and his fucking cock

395
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,240
but to yourselves.

396
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,210
And to your dominus.

397
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,730
Doctore.

398
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,540
Salvius!

399
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,250
Hedylus.

400
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,220
Begin!

401
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,610
Illugorus. Firmus.

402
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,790
Logas. Helios.

403
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,800
Erato. Ephesius.

404
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,190
Celadus. Tarchon.

405
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,290
Celadus, Logas...

406
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,000
take position for final contest.

407
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,310
Mm.

408
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,990
So, you stand above all others
in the House of Ashur.

409
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,780
Logas has proven himself
worthy of the arena.

410
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,530
Were you not the one
who spoke of sacred grounds

411
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,540
watered with tears of blood?

412
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,040
Yes, Dominus.

413
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,580
Place thought aside.

414
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,710
Proculus
will not risk embarrassment.

415
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,670
He shall seek an opponent
with deadly consequence,

416
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,840
perhaps even the champion
Ammonius himself.

417
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,770
All those before me shall fall,
regardless of name or title.

418
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,360
Mmm.

419
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,900
See it so.

420
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,610
And be rewarded
for fucking effort.

421
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,750
The crowd again favors
your wares, Proculus.

422
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,750
Gratitude. Yet I fear
good Opiter may forfeit all coin

423
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,750
in attempts to restock
his ludus.

424
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,920
Well, fortunes may yet shift

425
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,170
- in my favor.
- As I would see it so.

426
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,970
Sun threatens zenith...

427
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,430
and, with it, promise of
most anticipated contest.

428
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,640
May the gods grant spectacle
to shake the very heavens.

429
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,930
Mm.

430
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,570
See our man ready...

431
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,570
and first victory of
the House of fucking Ashur.

432
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,480
It is time to embrace
your destiny.

433
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,860
A thing that I have
long dreamt of.

434
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,820
Now I've imparted all I can
in the days allowed us.

435
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,690
Bring honor to the name Logas.

436
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,660
And if the gods will it,
embrace the afterlife

437
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,280
with a dignity befitting
our brotherhood.

438
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,160
It is not I who shall fall
this day.

439
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,190
- How stands our man?
- Filled to overflowing

440
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,690
with lust for blood.

441
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,230
The gods may yet
bless us this day.

442
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,820
I hold no stock in them,

443
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,070
yet I would gladly stroke
Jupiter's cock to completion

444
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,990
if it held promise
towards our favor.

445
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,650
The gods hear your plea.

446
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,530
Gabinius returns from Rome
to bear witness to our efforts.

447
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,790
Gabinius. You grace us
with unexpected presence.

448
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,540
I had not thought
to see such a vision

449
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,330
for yet
a handful of days.

450
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,170
Heart could not bear another
fleeting moment...

451
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,710
- ...absent from your embrace.
- Mm.

452
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,970
Apologies. What news from Rome?

453
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,090
None to lift heart.

454
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,930
I entreated Pompey to offer
disbanding his army garrison

455
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,640
beyond city gates;
in return, in kind from Crassus

456
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,440
and his forces
equally positioned.

457
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,360
Well, a reasonable solution
to ease mounting tension.

458
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,270
I fear reason has taken wing.

459
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,650
Love lost between
the two consuls in recent months

460
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,950
proves too great a divide
to close with simple words.

461
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,280
Slightest spark of temperament
may ignite civil war.

462
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,660
Replace concern
of uncertain future

463
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,080
with more joyful present.

464
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,500
Wise counsel for all attending.

465
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,170
And well received.

466
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,460
Viridia did not accompany?

467
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,760
The games serve only
to reopen old wounds.

468
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,130
I bear gifts from Rome

469
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,840
- to aid in their healing.
- Mm.

470
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,470
Ah, let us not drag the day
into morose reflection.

471
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,970
I am for wine...

472
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,180
- and the clash of swords.
- Mm.

473
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,810
As I would see
desires satisfied.

474
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,190
She at last finds
fucking tongue.

475
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,280
Citizens of Capua,

476
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,240
honored guests
and beloved husband...

477
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,240
Liber Pater -

478
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,120
benevolent god gracing us

479
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,080
with most welcome
discovery of honey

480
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,170
and blessing us

481
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,130
with fertility,

482
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,500
harvest,

483
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,300
and wine...

484
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,430
...has also seen fit

485
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,930
to deliver most
extraordinary spectacle...

486
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,970
...for those

487
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,190
of faithful worship.

488
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,770
For the first time

489
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,360
in all of history,

490
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,190
the House of Ashur
presents upon the sands.

491
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,700
And who shall the Syrian
put forth?

492
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,370
Enter...

493
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,250
um...

494
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,210
Logas.

495
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,760
Enter Logas -

496
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,220
murmillo!

497
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,950
A momentous reception.

498
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,500
The mob does not know what
moves until motion has ceased.

499
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,170
They sound pretty
fucking moved to me.

500
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,380
And who shall face
such fearsome opponent?

501
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,680
Good Proculus has
chosen carefully.

502
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,590
Enter...

503
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,180
the Brothers Ferox, thraex,
murmillo and hoplomachus.

504
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,390
Three?!

505
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,520
Logas is to face
three fucking men?

506
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,490
What is this
fucking shit?!

507
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,880
Jest veers from proper contest.

508
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,500
'Tis but slight amusement.

509
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,840
See how the spirit of the crowd
is so lifted by it.

510
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,590
Whoo!

511
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,850
What is that he wears
upon his belt?

512
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,350
Trophies taken from
the lives he's claimed within

513
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,350
the arena... and beyond.

514
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,520
Ah!

515
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,200
May your sacrifice
find favor among the gods.

516
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,790
Begin!

517
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,340
Mm.

518
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,180
First blood to Satyrus.

519
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,190
Recall training!
They are but men!

520
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,560
They are aborted demon,

521
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,520
belched from fucking cunt
of the Underworld.

522
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,300
I pray the Syrian's man
does not fall too quickly.

523
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,170
I would see moment prolonged.

524
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,390
Kill this cunt!

525
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,400
Yes!

526
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,240
Brother!

527
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,790
Balbus!

528
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,910
Come.

529
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,380
Let us see how you fare absent
fucking brothers, little man.

530
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,880
Ha!

531
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,980
Is this the best
that Proculus offers?!

532
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,190
Ha!

533
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,230
My cock stands larger threat.

534
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,420
Fuck.

535
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,910
One day...

536
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,390
Yes!

537
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,310
Yeah!

538
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,150
No man stands above us

539
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,820
when laid to fucking ground!

540
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,060
They laugh.

541
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,400
They fucking laugh at us.

542
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,650
There sit mother
of fucking jest.

543
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,610
Regain your seat.

544
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,610
Would you have us sit and bathe
in fucking mockery?

545
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,740
They desire us gone...

546
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,120
a satisfaction
I would see denied.

547
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,000
Apologies, pressing concerns
wrest me from position.

548
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,460
Cossutia.

549
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,590
Day is but half fallen,
and I stand for Liber Pater.

550
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,010
- I would remain.
- And I would not.

551
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,470
What turns such mood?

552
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,770
Surely not amusement
at expense of the Syrian toad.

553
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,110
That toad is pet to
Marcus fucking Crassus.

554
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,360
I make overtures to temper
smoldering resentment

555
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,860
between the man and Pompey, only
to find wife stoking flames!

556
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,660
Apologies, Gabinius.
We did not think--

557
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,030
No, you did not.

558
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,660
If Crassus yet bore concern
towards the Syrian,

559
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,790
intentions would have been
made known. He is forsaken

560
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,290
and soon shall fade from Capua

561
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,210
as unpleasant memory
upon passing of time.

562
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,300
I pray words hold truth.

563
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,510
Come.

564
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,100
Gratitude...
for most enjoyable day.

565
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:47,390
Witness speed and ferocity
unmatched upon the sands!

566
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,640
Little shit!

567
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,900
Oh!

568
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,280
Most honored guest
at last arrives.

569
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,780
Behold the mighty Syrian -

570
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,030
Dominus of the House of Asses.

571
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,550
Pay him no heed. Satyrus
drinks as man fully formed,

572
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,710
overfilling flyspeck vessel.

573
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,550
Voice so small to
be barely of note.

574
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,680
Yet louder than your man
in the arena with throat slit

575
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,270
by tiny hand.

576
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,680
I shall compensate for your loss

577
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,690
in hope that jest is received
in manner intended.

578
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,730
- It has been taken as intended.
- Ah. Sentiment well met.

579
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,740
I would not have Crassus
believe otherwise.

580
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,740
I find no reason to concern him
with such matters.

581
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,370
We are one in this regard.

582
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,870
Perhaps more common ground
may yet be claimed.

583
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,620
Is the man incapable

584
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,130
of speaking plainly?

585
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,340
Apologies.

586
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,470
I should reduce words so
base intellect may grasp intent.

587
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,380
I have born your jest
absent complaint, yet

588
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,810
the House of Ashur has not yet
been afforded proper contest.

589
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,390
You seek additional position
in the arena?

590
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
Crowd turns
weary of repeated meal.

591
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,730
They quench hunger by devouring
new and unusual meat.

592
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,770
Perhaps if you acquired
something novel to offer.

593
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,450
I shall redouble the effort
to secure undiscovered spectacle

594
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,700
and see rematch upon a day.

595
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,580
A thing greatly anticipated.

596
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,120
Ah, good Herennius has arrived.

597
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,870
Let us greet him, lest Opiter
bores the man to early grave.

598
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,920
Hm.

599
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:43,090
Herennius, I trust Opiter and
noble wife have offered wine.

600
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,140
There stood a time such insult
would have been paid in blood.

601
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,890
Would that sun
reversed its course

602
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,390
and return us to fucking moment.

603
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,680
Come.

604
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,770
We must secure stock matching
purpose to regain footing.

605
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,690
Are we to train men
the size of children now?

606
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,900
I would force sword
into hand of newborn babe

607
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,150
if the crowd desire such.

608
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,530
The slaver Rusonius
here in Capua

609
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,160
holds none of exotic nature.

610
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,160
We shall seek further abroad,
to Neapolis or Cumae,

611
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,660
and pray the gods
you're forever moaning about

612
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,080
at last present fucking selves.

613
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,020
You shall behold no finer
specimens within Republic.

614
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,770
Each man stands fresh from
journey across Tyrrhenian Sea.

615
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,280
Breathe in intoxicating scent of
future triumphs upon the sands.

616
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,990
I have conjured more worthy
shits from troubled bowels.

617
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,320
What of the Gaul?
He cuts a form towards promise.

618
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:57,080
We possess a dozen
yet carved in the man's image.

619
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,500
We must present unknown delights
to ignite the crowd

620
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,420
and gain attention
of fucking Aedile.

621
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,630
- When's the next shipment due?
- By month's end. Perhaps then--

622
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,050
You fill cup with warm piss
and expect request for more?

623
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,180
Let us to Cumae and hopes of
more fragrant opportunity.

624
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,180
You grasp gold
from a sow's arse.

625
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,600
And will plunge to fucking
shoulders in the seeking of it.

626
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,190
Cumae will provide
even less for consideration.

627
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,690
We should return to Capua...

628
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,900
- Halt!
- ...and then--

629
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,030
- Aargh!
- Seize her!

630
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,910
- Ah!
- Aargh!

631
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,750
Aargh!

632
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,270
- Aargh!
- Aah!

633
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:02,810
Move...

634
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,690
and see life fucking forfeit.

635
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,020
Halt!

636
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,320
Ah!

637
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,450
This one seems to have presented
unfortunate complications

638
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,780
to your day. I would
remove her from concern,

639
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,780
lest further embarrassment
arise.

640
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,280
She struck a Roman.

641
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,910
I'll see her removed
from this fucking life.

642
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,750
Let us not fall to
bloody disagreement.

643
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,500
Give way, you fucking shit.

644
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,460
This fucking shit holds favor
of Marcus Licinius Crassus,

645
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,800
Co-Consul of Rome,

646
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,960
and I, his man in Capua.

647
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,720
Lay hand upon me
or those in my employ,

648
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,180
and word shall reach him
of offense.

649
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,760
You are his Syrian,

650
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,850
who aided the Republic
against the rebel Spartacus.

651
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,690
I stand the same.

652
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,320
I believe this should
more than balm wounded pride.

653
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,780
We stand for Crassus
against the butcher, Pompey.

654
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,660
Relay allegiance
if opportunity arises.

655
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,660
Fall to fucking form! Move!

656
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,500
You waste coin on another
fucking house slave?

657
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,080
No.

658
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,670
The gods I do not believe in
manifest unexpected gift,

659
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,800
one I would see
towards advantage.

660
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,380
Move.

661
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,850
You have truly fallen
from fucking sense!

662
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,560
I but rise above lesser minds.

663
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,940
You would have me train a woman
to stand in the arena.

664
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,980
A woman? Upon the sands?

665
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,770
The very notion of
fucking perversion.

666
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,360
Perversion not yet tasted
by ravenous crowd.

667
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,860
One that shall gain notice
impossible to ignore.

668
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,780
Hilara would present
equal challenge

669
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,490
pitted against
fucking gladiator.

670
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,740
I have witnessed
many of breast and cunt

671
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,660
far more deadly
than their opposite.

672
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,620
Among rank of Spartacus
and his rebels,

673
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:50,710
they stood as fierce as any
possessed of cock and balls.

674
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,420
Ha ha!

675
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,710
You are set upon course?

676
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,420
Mm.

677
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,180
Have her bathed and
brought to office chambers.

678
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,140
Let us gaze upon
glorious future.

679
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,020
Ha!

680
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,770
- Has she taken food?
- As jackal upon wounded prey.

681
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,600
Who could lay blame?

682
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,060
Journey through the belly
of a slave ship

683
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,600
offers few comforts,

684
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,190
as any who have survived such
may attest.

685
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,530
See this dispatched to Rome
at first light to be delivered

686
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,660
into no other hand than
possessed of Crassus himself.

687
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,410
Yes, Dominus.

688
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,790
Are you able to break
common tongue?

689
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,630
Close gap. I would have
closer inspection.

690
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,510
Come. I bear no teeth...

691
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,550
and would be greeted in kind.

692
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,360
What name do you carry?

693
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,820
Neferet.

694
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,400
Neferet?

695
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,740
Most pleasing upon tongue.

696
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,830
Yet not upon Roman ear. They
desire more familiar personage.

697
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,950
Yes, one stirring reflection
of ancient legends

698
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,080
and impossible exploits

699
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,880
of lore.

700
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,460
Achillia.

701
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,930
The name you will bear
from this day forward -

702
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,590
Achillia.

703
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,800
Imagine the crowd chanting such,

704
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:10,980
the sound assaulting
the very heavens in your honor.

705
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,100
Crowd?

706
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,650
You're not without skill
in way of combat,

707
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:17,110
evident keenly presented
upon shores of Neapolis,

708
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,730
yet you stand
as newly forged blade.

709
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,820
Sound of steel...

710
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,240
yet dull of edge.

711
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,910
I will have you honed
to deadly advantage

712
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,200
and unleashed upon
the sands of the arena...

713
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,120
to the roar

714
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,120
of the crowd.

715
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,000
And you may reap benefits...

716
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,260
such adulation provides.

717
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,270
Do such benefits
promise more wine?

718
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,100
Ha!

719
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,230
Enough to drown the gods
if you so desire.

720
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,020
You but need to fall
to command--

721
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,610
Ugh!

722
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,740
Move and see
his fucking life forfeit.

723
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,490
Hold ground.
Hold... fucking ground.

724
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,530
- Release him!
- You cannot slip these walls.

725
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,200
Then we fall from
this world entwined.

726
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,830
I will not die a fucking slave
to men such as you.

727
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,920
We are all of us but slaves
to those of means and position

728
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,040
who move us upon board,
pieces in game,

729
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,460
sacrificed upon whim or need--

730
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,840
Speak clearly while you yet
have thought to form words.

731
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:29,100
Even if you slip these walls,
you will never be truly free.

732
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,180
They will hunt you down for
such offense and see life ended.

733
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,810
A fate more desirable
than one bound in chains.

734
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,730
There is another way.

735
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,690
Pledge oath. Call me dominus
and fight in the arena.

736
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,650
Earn your freedom
upon the sands.

737
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,490
A freedom the Romans
can never seize

738
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,660
from you.

739
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,700
Such a thing is possible?

740
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,250
I stand proof it is so.

741
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,130
Let us,

742
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,210
uncouple from history,

743
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,880
and embrace,

744
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,170
unknown tomorrow.

745
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,470
Leave her!

746
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,560
We struck a bargain.

747
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,610
Have we not?

748
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,000
Dominus.
