1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,812
Seriously, you don't have to come.

2
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:07,563
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

3
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:10,984
Take a rest for today.

4
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:18,218
Open the trunk.

5
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,656
I know.

6
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:26,141
I need to hang up now.

7
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:30,320
You are smoking in the car again.

8
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:30,884
Okay.

9
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:31,695
Tomorrow.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,162
(Xiao Lin)

11
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:48,023
The rain came in so quickly.

12
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,914
How long are you gonna stay this time around?

13
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:53,023
Three to four days perhaps.

14
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:55,062
Why don't you stay a little longer?

15
00:00:57,867 --> 00:00:59,750
Did Grandma just call?

16
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:01,219
Yes.

17
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:03,086
She knows you're coming back home.

18
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,335
And she insists on coming to see you.

19
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:05,969
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

20
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:07,265
Is mom home?

21
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:12,922
Not for now.

22
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,523
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

23
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,875
Yes, I had my meal.

24
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:17,429
You ate already?

25
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:19,500
I ate while I was in the shuttle.

26
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:29,757
Why didn't you bring your girlfriend back?

27
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:31,000
Huh?

28
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:31,695
I mean

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,179
why isn’t your girlfriend coming
with you this time?

30
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,398
We broke up long time ago.

31
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:37,351
What?

32
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,789
I don't have any feelings for her anymore.

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,273
What sort of a relationship did you have with her?

34
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:43,429
You know your grandmother is still waiting
to see her granddaughter-in-law.

35
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,711
There will be a few of
my friends at home.

36
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,335
Remember to say hello to them.

37
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,359
Don't ignore them like you used to do.

38
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,594
You heard me?

39
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:57,570
Yes, I did.

40
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:01,867
There you are.

41
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:03,085
You guys are finally back.

42
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,781
Come and sit.

43
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:06,320
You guys haven't started drinking yet?

44
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:07,695
We are waiting for you.

45
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,617
You needn't have waited for me.

46
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,562
Let's pour the liquor.

47
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:12,188
How about the food?

48
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:13,351
Good.

49
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:14,711
Let's get some.

50
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:17,375
Where's your son?

51
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:18,539
He's back there.

52
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:19,554
Leave him alone.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,132
Come on.

54
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:23,140
Let me help you.

55
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:24,023
You are back, Xiao Lin.

56
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,492
Let's eat together.

57
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:26,968
I've already eaten. You guys can start without me.

58
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:27,734
Let me get you a bowl and chopsticks.

59
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:29,828
No thanks, Auntie.
Please stay seated. I'm full for now.

60
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,477
Guess kids don't want to eat with us.

61
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:34,000
What's tasty when you are surrounded
by a bunch of old men.

62
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:36,273
Ok, let's drink.

63
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,437
Lin.

64
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,983
Your son is such an obedient child.

65
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:45,085
Look at my daughter.

66
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,895
I don't even know
if she will go to university.

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,764
Right.

68
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:48,671
I'm worried.

69
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:49,827
Your daughter is beautiful though.

70
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:50,741
You have nothing to worry about.

71
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:53,483
She is a girl. You should see
how beautiful your daughter is.

72
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,233
Is she a flower vase?

73
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,708
She will definitely mend her ways after finding
the perfect mother-in-law.

74
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,928
There is still a chance for her to choose.

75
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:58,124
Yes.

76
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,139
You just wait to enjoy your life thereafter.

77
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:00,139
Nevertheless, we're still anxious.

78
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:01,796
A daughter is a warm jacket.

79
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,694
Look at Wang's son.

80
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,850
He is getting married.

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,444
So fast.

82
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:07,538
When is the wedding?

83
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,483
That brat of mine.

84
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:10,530
Studying has never been his thing.

85
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,170
However, he managed to
find himself a girlfriend.

86
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,686
Guess it's true when they say
"like father, like son", huh?

87
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:20,272
Lin, look at your son,
a master of both, pen and sword.

88
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:21,444
He is cute too.

89
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,733
Oh, forget it.

90
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:23,655
By the way, have you guys ever noticed?

91
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,397
Liu hasn't gotten married until now.

92
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,413
Which one?

93
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,827
The one we had a drink with last time.

94
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:29,842
The one who lives next to Wang.

95
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,389
Oh my neighbor.

96
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:32,866
Yes, the fisherman.

97
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,217
He is in his 40s, right?

98
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:37,600
I believe there is something seriously wrong
that he is still not married in his 40s.

99
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,460
No matter how many girls
his family made him meet.

100
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:43,280
Definitely.

101
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,717
There must be something wrong after all.

102
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,928
Either physically or psychologically.

103
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:49,616
Maybe you are right.

104
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:52,147
Well, rumor has it that he is gay.

105
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:54,920
Ok, ok. Stop talking nonsense.

106
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:56,952
Here we go.

107
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,977
- Let's drink.
- Ok, ok. Let's stop talking about this.

108
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:02,280
There are so many things happening
in today's society.

109
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:04,905
Xiao Lin, have some more.

110
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:06,256
No thanks, you guys dine first.

111
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:19,780
Xiao Lin.

112
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:20,741
Huh?

113
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:21,249
Xiao Lin.

114
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:22,061
Huh?

115
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:23,678
Do you have a girlfriend?

116
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:25,319
Huh?

117
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,256
I said, do you have a girlfriend?

118
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,381
Oh, not yet.

119
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:32,491
No way. Lin, you should be more concerned.

120
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:35,280
He is not talking because his Dad is around.

121
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:36,194
Xiao Lin.

122
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:38,335
Go get some fruits
for your uncles and aunties.

123
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,351
Is two enough?

124
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:46,726
It's good.

125
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,827
Our main mission is the liquor.

126
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:48,944
Apples are just decorations on the side.

127
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:49,670
That's right.

128
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:52,249
He is being so immature at his age.

129
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:53,202
It's ok.

130
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,116
Kids are the same.

131
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:55,600
Let's drink.

132
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,163
Sorry.

133
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:43,678
(Install)

134
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:47,428
(Search)

135
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:50,608
(Basketball)

136
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:51,889
(No related content found)

137
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:57,139
(Ouyang Fugui: Hello, are you there?)

138
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,647
(Application Lock)

139
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:21,428
Xiao Lin.

140
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:24,132
It's your birthday tomorrow.

141
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:26,530
How about getting you a cake?

142
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:29,460
I don't think so.

143
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,694
It's boring when it's only
you and me celebrating it.

144
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,038
The dishes are not done.

145
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,366
All the alcohol you drink.

146
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,655
The floor is not mopped.

147
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,858
The house is such a mess
when Mom is not home.

148
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:23,413
(Ouyang Fugui: Hello, why are you silent?)

149
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,959
(Don't send me a message.)

150
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:31,342
(I'm just curious and only looking around.)

151
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,951
(I'm straight.)

152
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:39,101
(Ouyang Fugui sent you a message)

153
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:42,271
You are straight?

154
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,537
I don't buy it.

155
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,561
I'm running out of inspiration for my writing.

156
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:48,351
It especially makes me want to
talk and get some fresh air.

157
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:05,248
I'm currently drafting a novel.

158
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:20,709
How about you come out and
we can see how it goes?

159
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,451
Let's take a walk
when there is nothing else to do.

160
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,225
It doesn't hurt to make friends, right?

161
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:54,896
You’re done eating?

162
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,194
Yes.

163
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,780
What are you going to do?

164
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:01,154
Just going out.

165
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:04,436
Where? It's late.

166
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,694
Come back early in the evening.

167
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:11,818
Your grandmother is coming.

168
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:13,381
Got it.

169
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:41,264
Hey.

170
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:42,850
Hello.

171
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:44,022
Sorry.

172
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:44,732
Thank you for waiting.

173
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,060
Oh, no, I just arrived too.

174
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:47,741
Let's go.

175
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,068
Yeah.

176
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,334
Why are you keeping such a distance from me?

177
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:58,600
Don't worry. I'm not going to eat you.

178
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:00,061
It’s all right.

179
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:03,568
So, it's your first time meeting someone?

180
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:04,560
Oh, yes.

181
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:07,357
What kind of novel are you working on?

182
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:11,006
It's actually in the area of news.

183
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,209
I often tend to write novels in my spare time.

184
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:14,522
I recently just

185
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:15,607
published a book as well.

186
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:17,115
That's great.

187
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:18,678
I guess.

188
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,568
Actually, I also like writing.

189
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:21,819
and reading is a preferred activity for me.

190
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,865
What do you read then?

191
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,982
All of it.

192
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:28,240
Locally, Wangbo's Drifting
Beijing Shanghai and Guangzhou.

193
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,732
Internationally, The Great Gatsby.

194
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:31,983
That's great.

195
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,061
You sure read a lot.

196
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:35,154
What's your major?

197
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:36,670
I'm in the Chinese Department.

198
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:38,842
Let's take a walk inside.

199
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:40,662
Cool.

200
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:46,037
Personally, I perfer Duna Barnes.

201
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,131
Who is Duna Barnes?

202
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:49,123
A female writer from the States.

203
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:51,303
She is actually homosexual.

204
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,818
But she refuses to admit it.

205
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:54,857
Just like you.

206
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,506
What do you mean like me?

207
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:58,693
Then, why did you say you are straight?

208
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,021
I am.

209
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:02,975
Or

210
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,170
I may say I'm bisexual.

211
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,732
I've had a couple of girlfriends.

212
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:08,342
Oh, impressive.

213
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,037
Then why did you download the app?

214
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,725
I'm just being curious.

215
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,342
The same reason I met you.

216
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:17,256
After all,

217
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:19,623
I've never met any gays in my real life.

218
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:21,967
It's not that you haven't seen them.

219
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:23,967
There must be some around you,

220
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,217
but you just don't know about them.

221
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:28,068
Really?

222
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:28,990
Maybe.

223
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:30,951
Your name is Ouyang Fugui?

224
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,631
A lot of people call me that.

225
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:35,810
However,

226
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,310
I made that name up.

227
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:38,866
For me,

228
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,420
an earthy first name

229
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:43,482
sounds funny especially when it comes
after a rather nobel last name.

230
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:44,983
Which grade are you in?

231
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm a freshman.

232
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,038
Have you ever been to the woods?

233
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:49,670
Is there an area that is accessible?

234
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:50,490
Yes.

235
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:51,021
Let's go.

236
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:51,935
I'll show you around.

237
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,202
Wow, what a nice place.

238
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,771
I can't believe I've never been here before.

239
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:08,381
Didn't you ever try to step out?

240
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:09,326
Never.

241
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,795
I thought there weren't any more routes around here.

242
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:12,951
Every cloud

243
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,373
has a silver lining.

244
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:15,491
Go.

245
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:16,326
Let's go to the river.

246
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,350
How can I get there?

247
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:18,779
Cross it over.

248
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,702
For a town as small as ours,

249
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:26,482
this is the only place
where you can see the bridge clearly.

250
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:36,037
By the way,

251
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:37,678
are you going to get married?

252
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:38,615
Marry?

253
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:40,030
No way.

254
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:41,451
Why should I get married?

255
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,279
Would it be a disaster for the girl
if I was to marry her?

256
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,740
Your family knows you're gay?

257
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,529
Yes, I came out.

258
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,038
Awesome.

259
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:51,920
What was their reaction like?

260
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:53,248
In the beginning,

261
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,928
they surely disagreed.

262
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:56,975
They forced me to go on a blind date or something.

263
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,084
Bit after a while,

264
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:00,537
when they realized that I was good on my own,

265
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:02,006
then they quit.

266
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:03,725
Thereafter,

267
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,248
it's my mom who comforted my dad.

268
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,068
I'm friendlier with my mother.

269
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:11,131
She accepted it more quickly.

270
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,475
I guess

271
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:18,506
most gays have a better relationship
with their mother than with their father.

272
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:20,435
You too, right?

273
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:26,295
My parents got divorced.

274
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:29,287
Oh.

275
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:30,506
I'm sorry to hear that.

276
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,756
No worries.

277
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:37,920
So your parents are cool with you living
with your boyfriend, right?

278
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,365
Well, we've broken up for a while now.

279
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:42,912
as a result of our work.

280
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:43,998
We were in a long distance relationship for too long.

281
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,373
Look, the distance.

282
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,951
Does this count?

283
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:49,912
Let's go.

284
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,912
For us it did.

285
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,771
But I know of a friend

286
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,654
who's been in a long distance relationship
with his boyfriend for about four years now.

287
00:13:58,576 --> 00:13:59,803
I can't do it.

288
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:01,678
You know a lot of gays?

289
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,139
Well.

290
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:08,396
Do you remember seeing
those middle-aged people in the park earlier?

291
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:10,053
Maybe

292
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:11,490
they are pair of gays.

293
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:13,397
Really?

294
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,029
In our town,

295
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,021
a lot of the middle-aged gay guys
go out there for dates.

296
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,053
Likewise, the woods back there

297
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:22,248
is also considered a default place to gather around.

298
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:24,982
Is that so?

299
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:27,404
Only now do I understand
why they stared at us earlier.

300
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,444
So

301
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:31,896
Don't feel that you are excepted.

302
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:34,240
It's not a shame to admit it.

303
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:36,076
Perhaps

304
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,428
those two fishermen back there
are a gay couple as well.

305
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:44,865
It would be great if everyone around here was gay.

306
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:46,896
How so? Who is it that you fancy?

307
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:48,264
No.

308
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,373
Do you know of the furthest distance
in the world?

309
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:56,842
It is

310
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,545
when a homosexual falls in love
with a heterosexual.

311
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:01,615
Or when a heterosexual

312
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,342
falls in love with a homosexual.

313
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,452
So,

314
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:08,068
I don't think you can accept yourself.

315
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:09,553
Don't worry.

316
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:10,748
I can understand.

317
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:12,529
Everyone goes through a stage.

318
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:13,577
So did I.

319
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,959
And even you dated girls before,

320
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,178
it doesn't mean anything.

321
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,529
Could I ask you

322
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:22,123
what sort of intimate things have you done
with your ex-girlfriend?

323
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:23,646
Intimate things...

324
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:26,772
I don't think so.

325
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:28,850
Sure enough.

326
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:29,865
What's the matter?

327
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:30,951
No, no.

328
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,413
I mean

329
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,092
you're one hundred percent gay.

330
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:37,896
A lot of gays have girlfriends
without doing anything intimate

331
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,279
because they don't want to.

332
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,342
I'm just not there yet, okay?

333
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,717
You have to accept who you are.

334
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,584
Am I right?

335
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:51,725
You see that you are using the gay dating app.

336
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:52,529
Which means

337
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,146
you've taken that step.

338
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,076
I hid the app.

339
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,139
I will delete it when I'm home.

340
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:58,646
Hid the app?

341
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,913
No, no, you can't be such a coward.

342
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:01,537
Come on, come on.

343
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,076
Take it out. Reveal it already.

344
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:04,287
Oh, no.

345
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,076
Be brave.

346
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:05,600
Oh dear.

347
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,670
I just want to see you reveal it.

348
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,029
Be brave.

349
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:08,904
Take it out. Take it out.

350
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:09,967
Okay.

351
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,288
Happy now?

352
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,529
Not bad.

353
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:25,717
This tree should have been here for decades.

354
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,787
When I came out,

355
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:31,475
This is where I made the final decision
after a long time thinking.

356
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,264
Actually I don't mean anything.

357
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,420
I just want you to accept who you are.

358
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,834
Look,

359
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:42,006
if you don't accept yourself,

360
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:44,217
then no one else will.

361
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:45,670
Right?

362
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,740
How come you’re back so late?

363
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,131
I had to heat the dishes twice.

364
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:01,983
Where's Grandma?

365
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,653
She went out for a walk

366
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:06,896
after all the waiting.

367
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,725
Don't smoke in the living room.

368
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:30,912
Don't go to the balcony either.

369
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,318
I just hung the clothes out to dry in the morning.

370
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:52,748
Xiao Lin.

371
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,435
You didn't bring your
girlfriend back this time.

372
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:58,060
Your grandmother is disappointed.

373
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:02,522
When will you get us a daughter-in-law?

374
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,436
The only thing you seem to care about
when it comes to me is this.

375
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,060
I don't see you worry about anything else.

376
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,116
Before 30,

377
00:18:14,756 --> 00:18:16,232
I won't consider getting married.

378
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,732
Thirty years old?

379
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,873
That's impossible.

380
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:23,990
Your grandmother and your mother

381
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:25,958
are all looking forward
to you having your own family.

382
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,153
Don't mention my mother.

383
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:29,802
You can't keep your own family.

384
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:32,044
All you know is how to smoke and drink.

385
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,638
So what if I drink and socialize?

386
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:37,786
WWho am I doing all this for?

387
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,654
I get up early and work hard every day.

388
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,771
I just want to save enough money
to buy you a house as soon as possible.

389
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,716
Do I need you to buy me a house?

390
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,724
I don't see myself living in this town.

391
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,693
So, you don't need a house
when you get married?

392
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,208
Or you actually think

393
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:59,529
you can afford a house on your own
by working in a big city for a few years?

394
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:01,521
I said it.

395
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,685
I don't need you to care about my future.

396
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:05,450
I only want to focus on my work and my career first.

397
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:11,029
I'm done caring about your business.

398
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:12,529
Take care of yourself.

399
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:35,615
Xiao Lin.

400
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,732
Grandma, you're back.

401
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:38,333
I'm back.

402
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:39,669
Why do you look thinner than the last time?

403
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:40,763
Really? Do I?

404
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:42,302
You haven't finished your meal yet, right?

405
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:43,897
Go back to eat.

406
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,247
Oh, why does it smell like smoke?

407
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:48,476
You’re smoking in the room again.

408
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,928
Xiao Lin is still eating.

409
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,070
Xiao Lin, Grandma prepared
a red envelope for you. Take it.

410
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:58,546
Grandma, I don't need it.

411
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,359
Take it.

412
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:00,361
I really don't need it, Grandma.

413
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:02,283
Look how skinny you are.

414
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:05,111
Take it to school
and buy yourself some good food.

415
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:06,767
Well, thank you, Grandma.

416
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:09,618
Is the gift that your father gave you good enough?

417
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:11,181
What gift?

418
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:13,384
Ah, your father didn't give it to you?

419
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:14,634
No.

420
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,189
How can you prepare it for such a long time

421
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,658
and not give it to him?

422
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,079
Where is it?

423
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:22,361
He doesn't need it. Then why give it to him?

424
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:24,197
Nonsense.

425
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,328
Where is it?

426
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:26,267
I'll give it.

427
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:27,970
Where is it?

428
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:29,478
Under the book.

429
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:34,771
You only know how to smoke.

430
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:37,880
Xiao Lin, look.

431
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:40,303
Property Ownership Certificate.

432
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:42,467
Property Ownership Certificate?

433
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,615
Right.

434
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:47,115
Your father just bought you
a house a few days ago.

435
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:49,263
It's for your wedding.

436
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:51,818
Your dad only knows about smoking.

437
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:53,529
The house is so dirty

438
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,146
and he doesn't know how to clean it up.

439
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,185
Look at your father.

440
00:20:58,436 --> 00:20:59,732
Never says a thing.

441
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:01,443
He worked hard to prepare it for you

442
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,154
yet he is being shy about it.

443
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:04,693
Actually,

444
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:06,943
he's always thinking about you.

445
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:08,677
I guess it's alright now.

446
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:09,748
After all of the toiling and moiling,

447
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:11,505
we've finally landed.

448
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:18,201
A person who drinks to socialize everyday
was house-sitting for a while.

449
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:20,763
Everything is settled now.

450
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:23,974
Xiao Lin is already attending a good university.

451
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:26,693
All we need to do now is find him a good wife.

452
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:30,099
So that I can finally have my great-grandson.

453
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:35,216
Oh, I don't know if I can wait until the day
when I'm finlly able to hold my great grandson.

454
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,412
Will I, Xiao Lin?

455
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,475
Yes, you can.

456
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:43,850
It's good if I can.

457
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:46,513
I don't have to see the rest of them
showing off any more.

458
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:48,474
I can show off too.

459
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:05,513
Is Xiao Lin still up?

460
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:07,013
Ah, Grandma.

461
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:09,701
My baby grandson.

462
00:22:09,943 --> 00:22:11,974
Let me peel an apple for you.

463
00:22:12,303 --> 00:22:13,107
Thank you, Grandma.

464
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,553
Get a good rest then.

465
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:16,404
Ok Grandma, you too.

466
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:57,287
Hey Handsome, you need a room?

467
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,451
What's wrong?

468
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:09,959
As men of letters,

469
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:11,966
we care about crying to our beer.

470
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,997
One more.

471
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,560
Do you usually drink a lot?

472
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:23,498
Not much.

473
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:25,107
Then drink more today.

474
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:30,115
Have another one.

475
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:32,802
Take time to think about

476
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,606
what I mentioned this afternoon.

477
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,919
I don't mean anything else.

478
00:23:36,943 --> 00:23:38,810
I just hope you can...

479
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:44,950
What's wrong?

480
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:45,817
You like him?

481
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:47,716
You think too much.

482
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:57,645
He's the most popular singer here.

483
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:01,482
Here. Have some more.

484
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:04,059
Have another drink.

485
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:04,903
No.

486
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:06,466
No.

487
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:07,677
No more.

488
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:13,591
Looks like you're weak when it comes to drinking.

489
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:19,723
What are you doing?

490
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:21,247
Just hold my hand.

491
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,036
How about being my boyfriend?

492
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:11,060
Are you kidding me?

493
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:13,544
I'm going to get married, ok?

494
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,068
What's going on?

495
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,380
Looks like what I talked about this afternoon
was a waste.

496
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:25,068
I don't believe you can get hard for girls.

497
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:29,950
Can't you come to terms and face your true self?

498
00:26:31,263 --> 00:26:32,482
Why can't I?

499
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,231
This is me.

500
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,419
Well what's real is the you just now.

501
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,294
I'm definitely going to get married.

502
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:42,880
Get married?

503
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,841
You dated so many girls.

504
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:46,403
You didn't even hold their hands.

505
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:49,052
Your marriage will turn out to be
a disaster for those girls.

506
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,318
Can't you be brave enough to just accept yourself
for who you are?

507
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:04,231
You don't understand.

508
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Here onwards,

509
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:10,481
we should avoid seeing each other often.

510
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,364
I don't wish to be gay.

511
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:16,317
What do you mean?

512
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:22,919
Don't you know that this is a gay bar?

513
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,403
Why did you bring me to a place like this?

514
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:37,114
Why? What's wrong with this place?

515
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:39,130
I'm heading home.

516
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,146
Can you face your true self?

517
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,458
This is me.

518
00:27:44,802 --> 00:27:46,208
Then go out there and get married.

519
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:03,763
Hey Handsome, do you have a girlfriend?

520
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,466
Let me turn off the lights.

521
00:29:38,255 --> 00:29:39,286
Wait a minute.

522
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,661
Wait for what?

523
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:44,966
I will do it by myself.

524
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,294
I will do it by myself.

525
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:49,982
Let me close the curtains.

526
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,270
Wait a minute.

527
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,419
Forget it. Forget it.

528
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,208
I have something else to do.

529
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:38,981
(Ouyang Fugui invites you to a voice call.)

530
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:49,198
(Are you sure to delete contact Ouyang Fugui?)

531
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:50,237
(Please wait.)

532
00:31:56,524 --> 00:32:00,260
(Uninstall)

533
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:34,146
Mom, you can go back now.

534
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,700
He'll come back for the Spring Festival.

535
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:39,481
It's ok. Have you got everything?

536
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:40,575
Yes.

537
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,091
Be careful when you are alone outside.

538
00:32:43,115 --> 00:32:43,966
Okay.

539
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:45,880
Study hard at school.

540
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:52,270
Bring your girlfriend back
the next time to show me.

541
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,638
If you have time,

542
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:55,865
just call your Dad more often.

543
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:57,083
Okay.

544
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:59,481
Don't make your Dad worry, okay?

545
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:01,263
Grandma, go back first.

546
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:03,880
Wait a minute.
I have something else I forgot to take.

547
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,052
What are you taking again?

548
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:07,755
Wait a minute, I will get here soon.

549
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,794
The more urgent it is,
the more forgetful it is.

550
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:25,919
My brain is of no use now.

551
00:33:25,943 --> 00:33:27,755
Why are you briging him this?

552
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,997
Xiao Lin, here take this tumbler.

553
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:31,278
Grandma, I have one at school.

554
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:34,302
Oh, how can it keep warm like this one.

555
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:35,238
All right.

556
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,231
Ma, get back.

557
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,177
- Okay.
- Let's go.

558
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:40,153
There's hot water on the way.

559
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,130
Pay attention to safety.

560
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,177
My wedding house...

561
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:20,513
Show it to me the next time.

562
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:24,106
Sure.

563
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:27,153
I will keep it for you to have it decorated.
