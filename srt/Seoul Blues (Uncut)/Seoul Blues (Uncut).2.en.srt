1
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:10,858
So I decided to confess

2
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:12,944
That I like you

3
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:34,674
What?

4
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,056
I'll go order some coffee

5
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,057
You explain it well

6
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:43,766
Okay

7
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:51,524
Were you surprised?

8
00:00:56,487 --> 00:00:57,655
What's going on?

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,699
Did you two lose a bet or something?

10
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:06,330
Or is this some kind of hidden camera prank?

11
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:09,625
It's nothing like that

12
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,086
We...

13
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:14,463
Decided to date

14
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:16,465
Huh?

15
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:22,304
I confessed

16
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:24,473
And that's how it happened

17
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:30,062
Oh...

18
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:33,774
Coffee

19
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:34,650
Thanks

20
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,659
Jeong-ha seems completely shocked

21
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:47,872
Seems so

22
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:55,046
So what about you two?

23
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:56,881
How, I mean...

24
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:59,800
In the future, what kind of...?

25
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:02,762
Dae-young, this one's worrying unnecessarily again

26
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,930
You say something

27
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,308
What's there to explain?

28
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:08,642
If we enjoy being friends

29
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:09,685
We can date too

30
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:10,728
Is that so?

31
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:16,734
Were you surprised?

32
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:19,111
Yes

33
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,865
I didn't know you two...

34
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,118
liked each other that much

35
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:31,290
It's disconcerting

36
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,710
I'm still a bit dazed too

37
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:37,046
Yeah?

38
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:40,841
Just a moment

39
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:45,846
Thanks

40
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,392
You said you were cold inside because of the air conditioning

41
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:52,228
Why did you come out dressed so lightly?

42
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:57,108
What if you catch a cold?

43
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,359
Being so sensitive to cold

44
00:02:58,526 --> 00:02:59,568
I'm fine

45
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:02,113
It's not that cold...

46
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:05,825
Want me to hug you?

47
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:07,284
Here?

48
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:08,202
Hey...

49
00:03:08,577 --> 00:03:09,328
What's wrong with that?

50
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:10,746
We're the only ones here

51
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:11,747
Still

52
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:13,290
Honey, I'm worried

53
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,542
you might catch a cold

54
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:16,335
Honey?

55
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,215
Wait a minute!

56
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,261
Uh...

57
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:29,890
Have you two already...?

58
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:35,104
Ah... better not think about it

59
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,774
What are you thinking?

60
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:41,193
Congratulations

61
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,864
Congratulations, and now I'll go to the bathroom for a bit

62
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:46,782
Jeong-ha

63
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:50,995
Yes?

64
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,581
Our relationship...

65
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,376
It's okay, right?

66
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:02,882
Yes

67
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:04,592
Of course

68
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:18,355
Huh?

69
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:20,149
Excuse me, I need to make a call

70
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:20,858
Okay

71
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,076
I'm sorry

72
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,662
Huh?

73
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:37,249
It's just...

74
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,211
After all these years together

75
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,795
For it to suddenly be like this, as if

76
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,631
we had conspired behind your back

77
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:45,966
Ah...

78
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:47,843
No, it's okay

79
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:51,513
Actually, I kind of suspected it

80
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:53,515
What?

81
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,685
That you liked Dae-young

82
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:00,189
Ah...

83
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,443
I think I noticed that the way

84
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,446
you looked at Dae-young was different

85
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:12,034
I see

86
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:16,997
After knowing each other for so long

87
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,415
Everything shows

88
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,209
That's true

89
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:24,672
Then, do you know that too?

90
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:26,840
What?

91
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:30,261
That Dae-young...

92
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,389
Doesn't see me as a woman

93
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,273
But don't worry

94
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:44,275
We won't break up or anything

95
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,776
I'll work hard at it

96
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:48,279
Will you support me?

97
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:56,412
What are you two talking about?

98
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:57,371
Huh? You're back

99
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:00,958
Can I charge my phone at your place before I go?

100
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,251
Sure

101
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:04,712
What about you, Jeong-ha?

102
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:06,463
Yes?

103
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:09,049
Want to have dinner with us?

104
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:12,928
Uh...

105
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:14,888
No, I have something to do

106
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,056
I think I'll have to go

107
00:06:16,682 --> 00:06:17,182
Something to do?

108
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:19,393
What do you have to do?

109
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,062
Hey

110
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:24,690
I'm a very busy person too

111
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,693
That's too bad

112
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:29,862
Let's eat together next time

113
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:32,823
Okay

114
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,741
Go...

115
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:35,868
Go

116
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:36,702
I'll be going

117
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,056
What are you doing?

118
00:06:58,265 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm looking up recipes

119
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:00,893
Shall we make pasta?

120
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,019
Yes

121
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,312
I have ingredients at home

122
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:05,147
I'll make you cream pasta

123
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:06,357
Great

124
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:14,490
Jeong-ha...

125
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:19,453
She seemed very surprised

126
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:22,873
Yeah

127
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:28,337
Were you teasing Jeong-ha earlier?

128
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:31,298
Huh?

129
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:36,303
When you said you'd take care of me and hug me

130
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,520
Whatever it is, I like it

131
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:48,107
Being alone with you like this

132
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,234
It feels like a dream

133
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:28,355
Dae-young

134
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:31,275
Yes?

135
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:34,069
Actually, it's my first time

136
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:37,823
But...

137
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,702
I want to do it with you

138
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:06,894
Kiss me

139
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:13,358
What's wrong?

140
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:21,408
Who is it?

141
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,869
Jeong-ha

142
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,371
If you call back in a little while...

143
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,748
Hello

144
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:29,750
Yes

145
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,549
I understand, I'll go

146
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,348
I...

147
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,061
I'll go out for a moment
