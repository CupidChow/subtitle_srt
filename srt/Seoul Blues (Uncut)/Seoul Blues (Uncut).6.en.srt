1
00:00:00,473 --> 00:00:01,515
Yeah, where are you?

2
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:02,391
Here

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,489
I think it would be good to do it like this

4
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,409
Definitely, putting the incident at the front

5
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:22,286
It seems to make the characters come more alive

6
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:27,375
Since Jeong-ha's writing flow is so good

7
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,753
For now, just keep writing

8
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,714
Things like editing or adaptation

9
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:34,924
Can be done later

10
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:35,549
Yes

11
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:38,970
Ah

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,138
This is CEO Shin Do-jin

13
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:43,432
I remember someone in the writers' community

14
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:45,267
Said they had their work corrected

15
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:46,686
But it turned out

16
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:48,729
It was a publishing company CEO

17
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:52,024
Nice to meet you

18
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:56,696
I'm Shin Do-jin

19
00:00:58,614 --> 00:00:59,448
Yes

20
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:01,575
I'm Jung Dae-young

21
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:06,622
Actually, writing one's own story

22
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:08,499
Isn't easy for a writer

23
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:14,213
After all, you have to keep digging up

24
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:16,132
Your own wounds

25
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,262
But Jeong-ha expresses that very well

26
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:27,727
So I became interested

27
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,730
And I'm helping out, though it might seem presumptuous

28
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,109
What kind of story is it?

29
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,529
You never told me about it

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,282
Ah

31
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:42,950
Well...

32
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:46,412
When it's published

33
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:48,706
You can read it then

34
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,003
Even between close friends

35
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,547
Showing your unpolished writing

36
00:01:58,382 --> 00:01:59,884
Isn't easy

37
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:02,803
We're not friends

38
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:11,020
If we're not friends...

39
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,857
Then what are we?

40
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:19,612
We are...

41
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:20,196
Ack!

42
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:23,491
We-we think of each other like brothers

43
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:25,201
More than family

44
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:27,828
Since we've known each other since we were very young

45
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:29,538
Our families all know each other

46
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,540
More than friends

47
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,046
That's nice

48
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:38,881
Friends like brothers

49
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,424
Ah...

50
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:44,220
I wish I had a friend like that

51
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:02,363
Are you angry?

52
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:08,911
Dae-young

53
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:14,625
That CEO's publishing company

54
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,877
Says they might publish my writing as a book

55
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:21,715
But there's no need to create misunderstandings

56
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,384
Or ruin chances for the book

57
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:28,180
Don't meet with that person

58
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:30,808
Huh?

59
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:35,229
I'd like you not to see that person again

60
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:38,941
What are you saying?

61
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,736
I'm telling you they might offer a publishing contract

62
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:44,113
There are plenty of publishing companies

63
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:45,823
It doesn't have to be that one

64
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:48,492
Don't you understand how important

65
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:49,952
This is to me?

66
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,542
Or are you...

67
00:03:58,252 --> 00:03:59,587
Are you upset because I didn't tell you

68
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:00,462
I was dating someone?

69
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:05,634
Or are you misunderstanding something?

70
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:09,388
I don't have any relationship with that CEO

71
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:10,347
It's just strictly business

72
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,766
They always approach like that

73
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:14,393
What do you mean?

74
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:18,105
Ah...

75
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:20,149
I mean...

76
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,069
Those kinds of people

77
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,404
Tend to approach that way

78
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,740
I've seen a lot of cases like that around me

79
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:33,120
That man doesn't give me a good impression either

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,496
It would be better to work

81
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,831
With a better company

82
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:36,999
Huh?

83
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:42,254
You really don't understand anything about my work

84
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:44,506
What?

85
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:49,511
It's the first publishing company that said my writing is good

86
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:52,765
Do you know how excited I was about that?

87
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,518
And for you to so easily tell me not to meet with him

88
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:00,606
Isn't that like belittling my work?

89
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,274
No, it's not that I'm belittling it

90
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,360
Enough! I'll handle my own affairs

91
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:07,947
I'm leaving

92
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,241
Jeong-ha, Jeong-ha...

93
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:49,780
Hello?

94
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,323
Hello?

95
00:05:51,907 --> 00:05:52,700
Dae-young?

96
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:54,743
Who is this?

97
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:57,371
Shin Do-jin?

98
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,248
Why are you calling?

99
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,500
Jeong-ha has had a lot to drink

100
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,669
I think you should come pick her up

101
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:07,548
Oh, you're here?

102
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:10,467
Jeong-ha, are you okay?

103
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:15,514
How much alcohol did you give her to drink?

104
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:19,893
It was Jeong-ha who called me saying she had concerns

105
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:22,855
Am I the one who should be scolded?

106
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:25,816
Do it like this

107
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:27,318
Can you stand up?

108
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,194
I'm going to the bathroom...

109
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:31,613
Don't anyone follow me

110
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:50,090
Did you approach her on purpose?

111
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,470
I'm not...

112
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:57,181
I'm not that idle of a person

113
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,558
Then are you saying this is a coincidence?

114
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:03,896
Ah...

115
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,481
The truth is...

116
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,193
I felt you

117
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:10,986
What?

118
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:15,157
The story that came out in Jeong-ha's writing

119
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,451
Wasn't unfamiliar to me

120
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:20,746
It was as if...

121
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:22,873
Someone's behavior and way of speaking

122
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:24,625
Were being imitated

123
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:29,004
So I became interested and read the writing

124
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:32,591
And I met with Jeong-ha to hear the story

125
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,259
The more I listened

126
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:37,471
The more I was reminded of you

127
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:42,810
But

128
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,270
I never dreamed it would actually be you

129
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:48,440
If this is a coincidence...

130
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:52,194
Is it a terrible fate?

131
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:54,905
Don't talk nonsense

132
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,783
You and I ended a year ago

133
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,077
Does Jeong-ha know too?

134
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:01,203
What?

135
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:04,998
What happened...

136
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,459
At the company

137
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:31,108
Just say you wanted to see me

138
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:35,654
That's enough for me

139
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:40,826
Don't talk nonsense

140
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:42,744
I didn't want to see you!

141
00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:44,329
And I don't want to run into you again!

142
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,834
And what happened that day

143
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:52,880
Don't give it any meaning

144
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:57,926
Please

145
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:00,971
Don't appear in front of Jeong-ha

146
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:05,726
Ah...

147
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:10,522
That might be a bit difficult

148
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:12,941
What?

149
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:17,154
Lately, things have been quite boring and tedious

150
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:18,614
But

151
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:21,366
Since meeting you again

152
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:25,120
Things have started to get very interesting

153
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,260
Meeting you...

154
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,305
Makes me feel alive

155
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,979
Do you know how long I waited back then?

156
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,440
And now you come...

157
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:59,154
Tell me you're sorry

158
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,156
At least apologize to me properly

159
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:02,533
I'm sorry

160
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:10,832
I'm sorry
