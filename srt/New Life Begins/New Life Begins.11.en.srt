[Episode 11]

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,130
You will meet someone better.

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,990
I won't.

6
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
What people think I will like

7
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,470
is not actually what I like.

8
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,920
Well,

9
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,870
-So you mean... -Yes.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,880
I like you.

11
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,530
Don't be nervous.

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,520
I will respect your decision.

13
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,690
I can understand what you're thinking.

14
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,390
I'll send you home safely.

15
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,030
I haven't said anything yet.

16
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,030
Why are you sending me home?

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,940
I mean

18
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,690
I haven't made up my mind yet.

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,780
Give me some time.

20
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,410
I'll tell you after I've made up my mind.

21
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,340
Okay.

22
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,329
Take your time.

23
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,900
You can think for as long as you want.

24
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,340
I found that Baifu likes sunbathing.

25
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,040
It's warm in winter and cool in summer in Xinchuan.

26
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,460
And it's mostly sunny this year.

27
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,390
Perfect for him to sleep in winter.

28
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,710
Just like Jichuan, it barely snows in Xinchuan.

29
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,480
I thought I'd see snow.

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,550
It doesn't mean I will stay.

31
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,140
Your lanterns are too big.

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,710
They are not symmetrical.

33
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,910
The big ones are more beautiful.

34
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,420
She even wants to beat you on the latterns for Spring Festival.

35
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,060
It's okay.

36
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:16,800
Let's go.

37
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,459
Are you going to the new mansion to supervise the workers?

38
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,320
I want to go too.

39
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,580
In case you abuse your power

40
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,470
and leave good things to yourself.

41
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,300
Miss Song, are you out of your mind?

42
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,470
Today is New Year's Eve.

43
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,900
We have to go to the palace tonight.

44
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,390
Right.

45
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,180
Then I'll get more red packet than you.

46
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,590
Sure.

47
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,150
Miss.

48
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,280
You always say you like Prince Zheng.

49
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,220
But you actually care more about Lady Wei.

50
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,290
That's true.

51
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,680
Are you in love with me?

52
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,550
No way!

53
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,130
I like dear Zheng.

54
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,800
And it's none of your business.

55
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,870
Besides,

56
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,500
do you know what love is?

57
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,860
Tell me then.

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,020
Loving a person is different from loving an object.

59
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,100
You won't care about the feeling of an object.

60
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,090
You can just take it if you like it.

61
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,840
But when you love someone,

62
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,690
you care about whether the person is happy or not.

63
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,930
You should learn to respect each other.

64
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,650
All you think about is him.

65
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,490
That's not right, Miss.

66
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,360
According to you,

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,920
you don't like Prince at all.

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,420
You pester Prince every day

69
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,650
to attract Lady Wei's attention, right?

70
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,320
Shut up!

71
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,390
Happy New Year!

72
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,900
Happy New Year, Mr. Li.

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,770
The New Year's Eve dinner in the palace tends to be very formal.

74
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,780
I'm afraid that you'll feel uncomfortable.

75
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,909
Let's eat outside.

76
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,540
But it's against the rules.

77
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,930
It doesn't matter.

78
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,840
In Xinchuan, we don't need to stick to the curfew

79
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
on New Year's Eve.

80
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,820
We can go to the night market.

81
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,810
Here.

82
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:07,720
Look!

83
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,800
How is it?

84
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,140
Isn't it similar to what you ate in Danchuan?

85
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,080
It's really the cayenne pepper from Danchuan.

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,340
Where did you get this?

87
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,070
It is a New Year gift from Madam Danchuan.

88
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,260
I asked someone to cook it

89
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,130
to give you a surprise.

90
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,380
There's this too.

91
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,280
The Wu Jiu specially brewed in Danchuan.

92
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,810
It was delivered this morning.

93
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,290
Try it.

94
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,710
Let's eat.

95
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,220
Wait.

96
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,340
What are you up to again?

97
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,840
You want to take one more Concubine?

98
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,570
Nonsense!

99
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,340
I have sworn!

100
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,090
I don't dare to do that.

101
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,860
No!

102
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,110
I don't think you dare.

103
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,960
Shangguan,

104
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,650
can you not be so fierce to me sometimes?

105
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,650
Look at...

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
How about hotpot?

107
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,360
Zheng!

108
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,650
Li Wei!

109
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,140
Happy New Year.

110
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,860
Jing.

111
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,970
You're eating hotpot.

112
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,570
Happy New Year.

113
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:13,700
Help yourselves.

114
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,300
Let's eat.

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,230
They are cooked.

116
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,680
This.

117
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,480
Are they cooked?

118
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,210
Smells good.

119
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,790
Wei.

120
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,220
How's the preparation for your new mansion?

121
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,480
It's almost done.

122
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,230
What about the servants?

123
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,480
You must have recruited many new servants.

124
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,340
It's hard to manage people.

125
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,390
You must be careful.

126
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,890
Thank you for your concern.

127
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,800
But most of the servants in the new mansion are on our side,

128
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,260
even those in the kitchen.

129
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,330
Then do you have anything else to do?

130
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,810
Only the banquet.

131
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,810
We can't be careless since we have to invite all distinguished guests.

132
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,480
We tried the specialties from nine regions last time.

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,460
So I want to try all the dishes in Xinchuan this time.

134
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,710
I really envy you.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,030
I heard that after moving into your own mansion,

136
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,230
you can go out freely.

137
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,720
When I can leave the palace,

138
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,960
I'll travel around

139
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
and enjoy myself.

140
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,380
We can travel together.

141
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,710
Sure.

142
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,380
And me.

143
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,070
Me too.

144
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,610
Did I say I would take you?

145
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,690
It's not easy for me to travel around the world.

146
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,750
I don't want to bring you along.

147
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,640
That's like bringing trouble to myself.

148
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
Or do you think I'm too happy?

149
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,410
Shangguan,

150
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,130
who else can you take?

151
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,100
You are my wife in name.

152
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,930
You can't run away with others.

153
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,150
She wants to run away?

154
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,200
She can't run away.

155
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,920
Who told you?

156
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,670
Just eat.

157
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,710
Even food can't shut you up?

158
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,330
I don't want it.

159
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,190
It's too sweet.

160
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,060
You just don't know how bitter life is.

161
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,580
This

162
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,130
tastes good if you dip less sugar.

163
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,080
It's good.

164
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,500
Are you here to eat or cause me trouble?

165
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,140
-You invited us. -You invited us.

166
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,600
True.

167
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,370
God.

168
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,130
I deserve it.

169
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,410
According to the rules,

170
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,910
official couples will celebrate New Year's Eve together.

171
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,830
Let's rest.

172
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,520
Prince hasn't came for days.

173
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,950
He blamed me for what happened in Jinchuan.

174
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,160
He won't come.

175
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,300
Well,

176
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,290
you don't want to do something?

177
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,260
Let's talk about it later.

178
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,680
Now is not the time.

179
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,630
I have a question.

180
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,570
Prince has never neglected Lady.

181
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,130
But for so many years,

182
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,550
Lady has never been pregnant.

183
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,750
Six years ago,

184
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,870
during the selection of women from nine regions,

185
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,600
Lady was the most popular.

186
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,020
But later,

187
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,120
Prince wanted to divorce and remarry.

188
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,250
So Lady panicked

189
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,140
and cut all her ties with the outside world.

190
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,110
She just stays in the mansion and take care of Prince.

191
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,730
Are you done?

192
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,060
Your handwriting is so ugly.

193
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,360
You ate the hotpot my sister sent.

194
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,420
How can you write such an ugly letter?

195
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,240
It's New Year yet you're causing people troubles.

196
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,230
You always scold me.

197
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,100
Then do it yourself with your good handwriting.

198
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,370
Here.

199
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:25,720
Do it.

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,460
Fine.

201
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,760
Move aside.

202
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,080
Nice handwriting!

203
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,840
Should I say it or not?

204
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,460
I didn't expect

205
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,120
someone could set off my handwriting so well.

206
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,690
If you have time to laugh at me,

207
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,150
why don't you go and study?

208
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,650
Look how old you are.

209
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,130
Even your elder brother has his own mansion and attends court meeting.

210
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,560
Well...

211
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,810
You don't understand.

212
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,740
Zheng succeeded early in life.

213
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,420
And me?

214
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,940
I will succeed late in life.

215
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,910
You're really shameless.

216
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,160
Well,

217
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,370
do you really want me to own my mansion earlier?

218
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,370
Of course.

219
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,220
It's boring to be trapped in the palace every day.

220
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,640
How free it is to live in your own mansion.

221
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
You don't want it?

222
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,640
But I have to enter the court first.

223
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,910
That means I have to graduate from the hall.

224
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,000
Then I have to get up at 5 a.m. every day

225
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,620
and rush to the attendance.

226
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,990
It's fine for students to skip classes sometimes.

227
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,610
Have you ever seen anyone

228
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,720
who skip work?

229
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,200
This...

230
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,850
There's no freedom left.

231
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,870
If you want freedom,

232
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,390
you have to pay.

233
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,200
You're living in your parents' house now.

234
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,250
After having your own mansion,

235
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,850
you'll live in your own house

236
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,670
and do whatever you want.

237
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,570
In this big world,

238
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,430
you can do whatever you want.

239
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,900
You can ride horses freely

240
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,780
and travel the world with your sword.

241
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,840
Do you understand?

242
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,760
It sounds beautiful.

243
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
But I still don't want to go to court.

244
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,680
Here.

245
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,740
It's hard to choose

246
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,300
the dishes for the banquet.

247
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,160
I seriously suspect you are doing this because you want to eat.

248
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,200
How many times have you sampled?

249
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,000
Exactly.

250
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,320
It's just been a few days after the New Year's Eve,

251
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,520
and I've been sampling here everyday.

252
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,710
I've gained weight.

253
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,400
Make up for what you didn't eat in Cangchuan when you were young.

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,560
Here comes the food.

255
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,240
Wei.

256
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,160
Let me tell you.

257
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,380
Do prepare the dishes on the banquet with less oil and salt.

258
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,360
It's good for health.

259
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,690
Here.

260
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,080
This is the snow fungus from Jichuan.

261
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,140
This is good stuff.

262
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,000
It's good for your skin.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,780
I want a bowl of this.

264
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,190
Here.

265
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,020
Give me a bowl.

266
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,110
-Here. -Thank you.

267
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,050
Smells good.

268
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,430
Here, Shangguan.

269
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,100
Smells good.

270
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,940
Why is Prince Han here today?

271
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,490
He likes to play with girls.

272
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,370
We are sisters

273
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,260
so I called him.

274
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,860
Wei, you're lucky.

275
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,970
You can move out

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,130
and live in the new mansion.

277
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,770
Unlike us,

278
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,120
we can't go anywhere.

279
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,330
I have to see An's face everyday.

280
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,730
I'm so annoyed.

281
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,650
Still better than Qi.

282
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,180
He's stupid and unreasonable.

283
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,120
How dare he say my handwriting is ugly?

284
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,010
At least Prince Qi is sincere.

285
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,740
He's not as hard to serve as Prince Song.

286
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,470
To him, men are above all.

287
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,590
They are right when they're right.

288
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,990
And they're also right when they're wrong.

289
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,620
I'm still thinking about what Prince Han said.

290
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,430
The dishes are too greasy.

291
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,620
Too greasy?

292
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,640
I'll note that down.

293
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,010
Forget that first.

294
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,460
Tell us about Zheng.

295
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,740
Prince Zheng?

296
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,280
He's nice.

297
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,190
Li Wei,

298
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,380
I am asking you seriously.

299
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,030
Are you in love with him?

300
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,750
No.

301
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,260
When I was in the restaurant,

302
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,120
I've seen a lot of relationships.

303
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,150
Her expression tells everything.

304
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,800
What's wrong with my expression?

305
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,080
Is it that easy to like someone?

306
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,640
I don't like him.

307
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,540
What do you like about him?

308
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,380
In my opinion,

309
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,600
it's not strange that she likes Prince Zheng.

310
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,480
He's the best

311
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,470
among our men.

312
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,040
Right.

313
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,620
Aside from the two legitimate princes,

314
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,150
Prince Song and Prince Yue,

315
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,870
An is nothing.

316
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,960
Jun is too sophisticated.

317
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,870
Qi...

318
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,510
Yan, Sisi's husband,

319
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,580
barely talks.

320
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,510
The 8th Prince died young.

321
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,480
Han is not included.

322
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,680
In comparison,

323
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,210
Zheng isn't bad.

324
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,940
Haitang,

325
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,680
I don't like what you said.

326
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,740
Zheng is so nice.

327
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,170
Every time Brother says I'm not a man,

328
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,790
Zheng always protects me.

329
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,920
He's kind and handsome.

330
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,570
Of course Wei likes him.

331
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,090
I don't like him.

332
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,560
I just couldn't find the right words just now...

333
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,500
He has many problems.

334
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,760
He has stomach problems and he's picky.

335
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,830
There is a lot of food he doesn't like.

336
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,940
I don't like him.

337
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,360
Is she scolding him?

338
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,050
Aren't you protecting him?

339
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,220
Yeah.

340
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,500
You are quite united.

341
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,170
Your Highness.

342
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,160
Dinner is ready.

343
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,960
Please move to the dinning room.

344
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,770
How about Wei?

345
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,760
Lady Wei is sampling for the banquet

346
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,280
with the other ladies.

347
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,880
Haven't they already sampled this noon?

348
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,270
It started in the morning.

349
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,540
But it's not over yet.

350
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,400
Listen.

351
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,660
It's been half a month.

352
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,700
It's hard to guess what she's thinking.

353
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,520
I agree.

354
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,280
You've told your true feelings to Lady Wei.

355
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,860
But she hasn't responded.

356
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,960
All she does is gather with her sisters.

357
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,160
What is she thinking?

358
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,480
No hurry.

359
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,280
A lifetime is long.

360
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,650
There will be an answer.

361
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,700
Your Highness,

362
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,570
my life may not be that long.

363
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,710
I am afraid that I can't see you holding hands

364
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,310
before I die.

365
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,010
Don't worry.

366
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,680
By then,

367
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,490
I will let you know our ending by burning you papers.

368
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,280
Let me tell you something.

369
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,630
Don't tell others.

370
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,660
Actually,

371
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,200
I've been wanting to leave

372
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,650
since I got married.

373
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,990
We've discussed it.

374
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,020
We have no feelings anyway.

375
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,940
As long as I don't cause trouble,

376
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,860
after he own his mansion and attend the court,

377
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,280
he'll find a way to send me out.

378
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,850
What about now?

379
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,280
Do you still want to leave?

380
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,310
He said

381
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,850
he likes me.

382
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,860
He wants me to be his wife.

383
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,980
His wife?

384
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,960
He wants you to be his wife?

385
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,210
That means

386
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,490
he really really likes you.

387
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,800
He really likes me?

388
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,650
You're from Jichuan.

389
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,150
In your opinion,

390
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,609
it's normal for a man

391
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,430
to spend his whole life with only one wife.

392
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,230
So being his wife means nothing.

393
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,490
But it's different in Xinchuan.

394
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,390
He was willing to bear all the consequences after you leave.

395
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,190
Now he's willing to break the rules and make you his wife.

396
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,490
He really likes you.

397
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,950
What about you?

398
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,190
Do you like him?

399
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,750
Recently, I found that

400
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,650
being with him makes me feel at ease.

401
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,110
Sometimes, I even want to move

402
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,760
to the new mansion earlier.

403
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,970
Eat with him,

404
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,080
read with him,

405
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,850
and plant vegetables with him.

406
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,070
Look at you.

407
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,200
You're completely in love.

408
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,620
You

409
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,750
are in love with him.

410
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,040
What if

411
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,980
I am just being impulsive?

412
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,460
What if I regret and want to go back?

413
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,040
I don't know him well.

414
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,280
He doesn't know me well either.

415
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,330
Isn't it irrational

416
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,790
to stay here on impulse?

417
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
That's also true.

418
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,930
Falling in love with the master

419
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,640
is not a good thing.

420
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,890
You'll become irrational if you fall in love.

421
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,760
But I think Prince Zheng's heart

422
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,490
is on you.

423
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,580
I think

424
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,640
you can give it a try.

425
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,740
Maybe you'll be happy.

426
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,820
Lady Wei!

427
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,420
Lady Wei!

428
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,950
This is the menu for tomorrow's sampling.

429
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,010
Please have a look.

430
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,040
Are you going to sample again tomorrow?

431
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,890
The main dishes have been decided.

432
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,720
But the dessert and fruits haven't been decided yet.

433
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,180
Indeed.

434
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,870
Desserts and fruits are also important.

435
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,060
It's a banquet.

436
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,350
We can't be careless.

437
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
I'll make my leave first too.

438
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,570
Okay.

439
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,650
Where are you going?

440
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,380
The same way.

441
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,640
How is it?

442
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,550
Is it time for the court meeting?

443
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,310
Almost.

444
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
Prince is coming.

445
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,430
May God bless Prince.

446
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,550
For everything to go well in the court.

447
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,400
Hope he will not be burdened by me again.

448
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,130
May God bless Prince.

449
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,270
For everything to go well in the court.

450
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,940
Hope he will not be burdened by me again.

451
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,220
-May God bless Prince. -Jia.

452
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,110
Your Highness.

453
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,160
Sorry for disturbing you.

454
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
But I had a nightmare last night.

455
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,820
I dreamed that you abandoned me.

456
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,620
If that's the case,

457
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,950
it's also my fault.

458
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,650
All I hope is that

459
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,090
your life can go well

460
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,240
and you can be healthy and happy.

461
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,330
Your Highness,

462
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,920
praying to Floral Immortal

463
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,430
is a tradition in Yanchuan.

464
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,240
These days,

465
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,600
Lady Wei has been praying for you every day.

466
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,860
She never missed any chance for praying.

467
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,290
How could I not know

468
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,830
your heart?

469
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,730
It's busy in the Ministry of Revenue around the New Year.

470
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,330
I didn't get time to meet you.

471
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,150
Don't take it personally.

472
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,920
As long as I am in your heart,

473
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,680
I'll be satisfied.

474
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,690
Don't think I don't care about you.

475
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,400
I know

476
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,300
everything you do.

477
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,690
Although I like you,

478
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,360
I can't indulge you.

479
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,460
Recently,

480
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,690
you've been seeing Lady Wei

481
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,960
too frequently.

482
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,610
Li Wei and I are old friends.

483
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,280
And she never

484
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,000
asked me anything about you.

485
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,280
Then did you ask about

486
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,360
the things in their mansion?

487
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,800
I only want to know

488
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,550
how to serve you.

489
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,640
I'm not good at scheming.

490
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,640
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

491
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,000
Forget it.

492
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,900
You just need to know it clearly.

493
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,780
But remember,

494
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,400
don't get too close

495
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,460
to the girl from Jichuan.

496
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,870
Your waist...

497
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,100
It's not as slim as before.

498
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,290
Beauties should

499
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,200
have a slim waist.

500
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,580
You should

501
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,840
eat less.

502
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,750
I used to love your waist the most.

503
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,520
You have to keep it up.

504
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,640
Yes, Your Highness.

505
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,240
Don't worry about me.

506
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,300
Just mind your own business.

507
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,790
Do you want melon seeds?

508
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,170
Here.

509
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,000
Do you want some melon seeds?

510
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,420
Here.

511
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,430
Thank you.

512
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,750
Here, Hao Jia.

513
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,870
No, thanks.

514
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,820
I'm on diet.

515
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,490
Diet?

516
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,230
You're so thin. Do you still need to control your weight?

517
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,890
I've gained weight recently.

518
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,760
I need to control myself.

519
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,100
So what if you've gained weight?

520
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,870
As long as you're happy and healthy,

521
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,180
it doesn't matter.

522
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,090
But

523
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,730
I really gained weight.

524
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,100
I can't eat anymore.

525
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,940
My clothes have become tight.

526
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,000
Now that you mention it,

527
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,980
I think I've been eating too much lately.

528
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,370
Wei.

529
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,200
It seems that since we became friends,

530
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,690
we've been eating more and more.

531
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,010
You are right.

532
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,710
You are right.

533
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,640
So it's my fault?

534
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,390
Ministry of Internal Affairs is going to send out new palace clothes.

535
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,950
I told them my original size.

536
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,010
I'm sure they'll be too tight to be worn.

537
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,010
What should we do?

538
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,670
Hao Jia,

539
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,320
can you teach us

540
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,860
some ways to lose weight?

541
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,070
Then I'd like to share something.

542
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,520
You can learn from me.

543
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,890
Pick up a snack.

544
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,140
Any one is fine.

545
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,740
Take a bite.

546
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Don't swallow it.

547
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,120
Hao Jia,

548
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,270
what do you mean?

549
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,210
We are like squirrels.

550
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,960
Here's the thing.

551
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,720
We should chew more than 20 times

552
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,460
for each bite.

553
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,280
It makes you feel full.

554
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,890
When you eat,

555
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,480
have a bowl of hot soup first.

556
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,080
Eat more vegetables and meat

557
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,000
and less grains.

558
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,470
But we can't avoid eating grains.

559
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,640
Because not eating grains

560
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,440
is not good for us girls' health.

561
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,410
After dinner,

562
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,960
it's best to stand against the wall for about 30 minutes.

563
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,740
In your daily life,

564
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,510
try to stand more and sit less.

565
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,520
This...

566
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,910
This is so crazy.

567
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,510
That's suffering.

568
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,480
It's nothing.

569
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,350
In Yanchuan,

570
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,450
girls have many ways to lose weight.

571
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,240
Like by eating bitter melon,

572
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,500
by eating only apples,

573
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,760
by not eating after noon,

574
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,880
or by not eating for seven days.

575
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,210
And there's a way to lose weight in 21 days.

576
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,900
That must be so painful.

577
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,490
Eating is one of the few joys in my life.

578
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,510
Who said it's ugly to look fat?

579
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,670
Yeah.

580
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,130
Stop practicing at night.

581
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,320
Don't lose weight with others.

582
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,150
You're thin.

583
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,340
That's my daily practice.

584
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,510
Look here.

585
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,150
How is it?

586
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,040
Previously,

587
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,960
I just needed some money for an emergency.

588
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,690
After that, I found ways to redeem it back for you.

589
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,890
What do you mean?

590
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,450
Wait.

591
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,890
Don't hit me again.

592
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,700
You can't hit me again because of the same thing.

593
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,830
It's not allowed in our household.

594
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,430
Thank you.

595
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,840
This means thank you?

596
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,120
You scared me.

597
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,510
No.

598
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,530
It hurts a little.

599
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
I can't handle it.

600
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,220
Alright.

601
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,840
No need to thank me.

602
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,400
Well,

603
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,700
as long as you're happy,

604
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,450
I am fine.

605
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,160
This dish is too far away.

606
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,640
Prince gestured for me to bring it to Lady Wei.

607
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,240
No, no, no.

608
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,420
I don't eat meat.

609
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
Give it to Song Wu.

610
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,400
Miss Song.

611
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,150
Please enjoy.

612
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,310
You poisoned it?

613
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,970
How is that possible?

614
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,440
Usually, you can eat a plate of meat yourself.

615
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,850
But you're giving it to me today.

616
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,300
Why?

617
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,760
I'm on a diet.

618
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,080
Diet?

619
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,610
You're not fat.

620
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,220
I am fat.

621
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,660
My clothes are tight.

622
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,380
It's no wonder since you eat a lot every day.

623
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,170
Then these are all mine.

624
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,750
Just eat your vegetables.

625
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,190
Here.

626
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:36,770
Read it.

627
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,390
Don't be too full

628
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,210
or too hungry.

629
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,640
Being full will hurt your lungs.

630
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,140
Being hungry will hurt your Qi.

631
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,870
You should eat when you should.

632
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,890
But you can't eat too much or starve.

633
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,680
You can hold back on your diet

634
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,660
by eating to around three-quarters of your fill.

635
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,050
But it's bad for your health if you starve.

636
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But...

637
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,940
The charcoal beef in Jichuan.

638
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,750
I asked Liu Baoquan to learn it.

639
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,410
It's not as good as what you had at home

640
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,390
but it's not bad.

641
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,080
Being too tight is the problem of the clothes.

642
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,940
Eat as you want.

643
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
That makes sense.

644
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,770
I need the energy from food to lose weight.

645
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:24,940
Your Ladyship.

646
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,470
Bad news.

647
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,340
Lady Haitang fainted at home.

648
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,290
What?

649
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,840
How could she starve herself like this?

650
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,300
It's all An's fault.

651
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,500
He insisted that we've gained weight

652
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,100
so he didn't let Haitang eat.

653
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,130
From now on, don't eat anymore.

654
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,110
Your Highness,

655
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,070
people will starve to death if they don't eat.

656
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,320
Missing one or two meals won't kill you.

657
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,890
Be good.

658
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,520
We can eat whatever we want when we lose weight.

659
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,860
And he wants our waist to be as slim as a... a paper

660
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,270
and our collarbones to be deep enough to place coins.

661
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,640
If we don't meet the standard,

662
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,840
he won't give us food.

663
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,330
This is too much.

664
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,170
How can he ask you to do that?

665
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,990
Does he have a good figure?

666
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,750
Exactly!

667
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,770
We don't need to lose weight!

668
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,230
Stop it.

669
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,970
Let's just be fat.

670
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,850
That's right.

671
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,790
Why do we keep slim?

672
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,830
It's for our health.

673
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,350
It's for our happiness.

674
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,580
There's no way it's for pleasing others.

675
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,430
That's right!

676
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,360
The most important thing in life is eating.

677
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,700
Enjoy eating and drinking.

678
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,190
Don't take troubles to heart.

679
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,880
Being tight is the problem of the clothes.

680
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,170
We can make it bigger.

681
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,590
Yes!

682
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,690
Wei.

683
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,280
Porridge.

684
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,440
Here. Here.

685
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,910
There's more.

686
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,910
Come and get this.

687
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:44,810
Slowly.

688
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,210
Here.

689
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,250
Have this.

690
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,750
Here, have one.

691
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,860
Your Ladyship,

692
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,040
I don't think it's appropriate.

693
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,200
There has never been

694
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,290
rule breakers like you in the palace.

695
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,630
I want to make this dress bigger.

696
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,590
From now on, I will go for the oversized style.

697
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,440
Anyway, this is me.

698
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,370
If you have a problem, hold it back.

699
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,150
Are you Prince Han?

700
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,300
Why do you know everything?

701
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,920
Prince didn't grow up with his mother since his childhood.

702
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,930
So he did many things

703
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,260
himself.

704
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,430
He's good at taking care of himself.

705
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:48,890
Shut up.

706
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,880
That must be hard.

707
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,270
Your Ladyship,

708
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,710
there are many things you don't know.

709
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,150
Prince had a hard life when he was young.

710
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,390
In order to train Prince Song,

711
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,570
Lord let him take charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs

712
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,720
But he secretly deducted the allowances of the illegitimate princes.

713
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,370
Then how could they eat well?

714
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,180
Prince

715
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,670
saved his own food

716
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,870
and shared it to his brothers.

717
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,040
Since he kept doing so,

718
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,050
he got the stomach disease.

719
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,300
Butler Su.

720
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,220
It's too much.

721
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,660
Not at all.

722
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,550
Your Highness.

723
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,590
A person who doesn't hold a grudge

724
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,400
because of the unfairness he received.

725
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,820
What a kind person he is.

726
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,580
Enough.

727
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,200
It's okay.

728
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,080
I want to know more about you.

729
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,620
Is being picky

730
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,580
also an excuse

731
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,750
to let others eat more?

732
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,920
No.

733
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,530
He's just a picky eater.

734
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,010
Su Shen.

735
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,020
Why is the handkerchief dirty?

736
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,950
Yuping, Yuzhan.

737
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,640
Let's go wash the handkerchief.

738
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,700
You can try.

739
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,030
Maybe you'll be happy.

740
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,180
Yin Zheng.

741
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,330
What did just you call me?

742
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,470
Didn't you ask me

743
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,680
to be your wife?

744
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,420
Do you dare to answer me

745
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
if I call you that way?

746
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,550
Are you really willing to be my wife?

747
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,110
But things are different in Jichuan and Xinchuan.

748
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,220
Do you understand?

749
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,090
You will be my only wife.

750
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,840
Then, yes.

751
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,270
♫I don't know what to say. I am so excited♫

752
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,060
♫But you can tell what is in my heart with your eyes♫

753
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,760
♫The road is long. Luckily, I have you♫

754
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,100
♫In rivers and mountains, let's appreciate the smoke rising♫

755
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,210
♫The past is gone with the sunrise♫

756
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,680
♫The warmth in your palm is in my heart♫

757
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,530
♫Let's share the light in wind, snow, and coldness♫

758
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:11,580
♫I am relieved when you are with me♫

759
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,190
Come back tomorrow after court.

760
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,949
If you see me waiting for you,

761
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:19,710
that means

762
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,020
I want to stay

763
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,659
and spend my life with you.

764
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,110
Finally!

765
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:39,500
Why are you crying, Butler Su?

766
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,110
You won't understand.

767
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,330
It's not easy for Prince.

768
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,280
Since he was young, his parents didn't love him.

769
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,130
He was bullied in the palace but he grew up to be an upright man.

770
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,190
His wish has finally come true.

771
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,170
Don't disturb them.

772
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,350
I wanna keep watching.

773
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,570
Don't disturb them.

774
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,340
The court meeting is the first step for you to get what you want.

775
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,080
I hereby

776
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,390
congratulate you.

777
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,260
After you enter the court,

778
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,960
we'll do as we wish.

779
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,920
We won't play tricks

780
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,230
and won't be blinded by power.

781
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,020
We consider things

782
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,460
for the people.

783
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,140
We consider things

784
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,860
for the country.

785
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,090
Focus on what's important and leave trivial matters behind.

786
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,430
We can finally see the sun.

787
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,720
Your Ladyship.

788
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,200
How did I fall asleep?

789
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,790
Here.

790
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,500
Put it on.

791
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,040
Oh no.

792
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,030
What time is it?

793
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,030
Did Prince leave?

794
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,310
Yin Zheng!

795
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,050
Today is your first day in court!

796
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,590
Don't be nervous.

797
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,010
Believe that you can do anything.

798
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,250
You're the best!

799
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,100
What did she just say?

800
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,340
Got you!

801
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,610
How did you know?

802
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,730
She might have said that

803
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,020
I'm the best.

804
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,230
How did you hear that?

805
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Bow in salute!

806
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,480
Greet the Lord!

807
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,230
Greetings, Your Highness.

808
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,220
Please rise.

809
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,260
My Lord,

810
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,580
the first debt of Jinchuan has been paid.

811
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,940
But now all the money of Xinchuan Government

812
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,060
are being used to assist Danchuan.

813
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,800
If Jinchuan presses us too hard,

814
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,130
we have no choice but to hold the Three-region Negotiation.

815
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,330
-My Lord, I think Xinchuan... -My Lord.

816
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,390
I think

817
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,060
Prince Song is right.

818
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,600
We are helping Danchuan out of mercy.

819
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,560
Jinchuan knew the situation

820
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,770
but still asked us to pay back the money.

821
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,550
If we keep obeying them,

822
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,470
we will lose our prestige

823
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,130
as the head of nine regions.

824
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,440
And we might also lose your prestige.

825
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:19,930
But...

826
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,590
Zheng,

827
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,200
it's good that

828
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,000
you don't dare to say anything during your first time in court.

829
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,860
Step aside.

830
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,880
We will teach you well.

831
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,200
Don't worry.

832
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,610
He tried his best to let father make an exception to promote him.

833
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,010
But once he goes to court, he's still under my control.

834
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,600
It's useless to get father's acknowledgement.

835
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,430
In order to repay the debt,

836
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,570
he offended all the officials.

837
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,690
I want to see who else will help him.

838
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,560
An.

839
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,460
Brother.

840
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,160
I know.

841
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,590
You

842
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,320
helped Zheng collect the debts

843
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,470
because you wanted to perform well in front of father

844
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,160
and move out of the palace as soon as possible.

845
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:48,970
That's true.

846
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,550
Brother.

847
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,410
I've been bored in the palace.

848
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,480
It's okay.

849
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,500
I understand.

850
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,640
It's all in the past.

851
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,740
I'll explain to everyone later

852
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,540
that you

853
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,890
were threatened by Zheng.

854
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,620
It wasn't your own intention.

855
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:08,800
An,

856
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,520
if you need anything,

857
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,890
it's more reliable to look for Brother.

858
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,230
Am I right?

859
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,070
Of course.

860
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,090
Thank you, Brother.

861
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,090
We are brothers.

862
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,650
You're welcome.

863
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,590
Let's go.

864
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,340
Your Highness,

865
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,760
how was the court meeting today?

866
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,340
Did something happen?

867
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:52,650
No.

868
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,380
That's good.

869
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,180
Let's go back.

870
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,190
Prince Zheng, please wait.

871
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,040
Prince Zheng.

872
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,240
Lord wants to see you.

873
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,810
Prince Zheng is here.

874
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,590
Father.

875
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,880
Madam Xinchuan.

876
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:32,670
Mother.

877
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,980
It's your first day in court.

878
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,490
Song is afraid that you'll be scared.

879
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,960
If you talk too much, you may make mistakes.

880
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,220
That's why he didn't let you say too much.

881
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,700
In the future,

882
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,290
you need to practice more.

883
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,180
Yes, father.

884
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,370
One more thing.

885
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,900
You mentioned

886
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,290
you need a hostess for your new mansion.

887
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,500
I've selected a perfect candidate for you.

888
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,360
The eldest daughter of Lord Jinchuan,

889
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,490
Princess Yuanying.

890
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:13,850
What?

891
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,150
Are you too happy to speak?

892
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,110
But I just want to let Mrs. Li from Jichuan to be my wife.

893
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,940
I don't want a new hostess.

894
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,020
Please grant my wish.

895
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,520
Li is from a poor family.

896
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
When you married her,

897
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,910
your father promised

898
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,220
to choose a better wife for you.

899
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,170
He is fulfilling his promise.

900
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,940
And this marriage

901
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,550
is offered by Lord Jinchuan.

902
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,420
I think

903
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,100
the Sixth Prince of Xinchuan is good.

904
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,060
He has a talent to help the people.

905
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,320
He is quite similar to Ying.

906
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,620
If you think it's good,

907
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,140
I'll go and ask Ying's opinion.

908
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,180
No need.

909
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,360
With her temper,

910
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,620
can we discuss her marriage with her?

911
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,490
I'll write a letter to Lord Xinchuan

912
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,980
to settle this with him.

913
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,770
The debt collection

914
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,850
in Jinchuan

915
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,680
was quite well done.

916
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,940
Lord Jinchuan highly appreciated you.

917
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,070
Princess Yuanying

918
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,760
has been known for her talents since childhood.

919
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,230
Marrying her won't be unfair to you.

920
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,260
But I don't want to.

921
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,090
Zheng.

922
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,140
Think carefully before you speak.

923
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,540
This concerns the affairs between Jinchuan and Xinchuan.

924
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,620
You can't refuse.

925
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,960
Father has promised to appoint Li as my wife.

926
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,620
Please fulfill your promise.

927
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,900
When did I promise you?

928
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,650
Besides,

929
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,200
don't you understand the benefits of marrying a princess?

930
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:04,690
Benefits?

931
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,900
I can't even ask someone to treat me sincerely.

932
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,450
What benefits do I want?

933
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,210
Even if there's a benefit,

934
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,440
will I get the chance to enjoy it?

935
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,390
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

936
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,620
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

937
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,120
♫A gust of wind blows♫

938
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,590
♫And stops by my ear♫

939
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,880
♫The moon shines♫

940
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,180
♫In my heart♫

941
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,750
♫Your smiles are all over♫

942
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,390
♫Gradually I am used to♫

943
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,190
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

944
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,920
♫I don't dare to get related♫

945
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,130
♫But you came to me♫

946
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,790
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫

947
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,490
♫I don't know what to say. I am so excited♫

948
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,290
♫But you can tell what is in my heart with your eyes♫

949
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:35,980
♫The road is long. Luckily, I have you♫

950
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,300
♫In rivers and mountains, let's appreciate the smoke rising♫

951
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,370
♫The past is gone with the sunrise♫

952
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:50,050
♫The warmth in your palm is in my heart♫

953
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,740
♫Let's share the light in wind, snow, and coldness♫

954
00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:02,040
♫I am relieved when you are with me♫

955
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,670
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

956
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,010
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

957
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,270
♫A gust of wind blows♫

958
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,690
♫And stops by my ear♫

959
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,080
♫The moon shines♫

960
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,390
♫In my heart♫

961
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,330
♫Your smiles are all over♫

962
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,660
♫Gradually I am used to♫

963
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,480
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

964
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,530
♫I don't dare to get related♫

965
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,350
♫But you came to me♫

966
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:10,430
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫

967
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,840
♫I don't know what to say. I am so excited♫
