00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,970
Please come inside.

5
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,320
Take a look inside.

6
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,479
Happy New Year.

7
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,370
The "Plum beauty" is from Hao Jia, right?

8
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,810
She sent a lot of them.

9
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,030
She said it was a gift to us.

10
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,729
We can either sell it in the restaurant

11
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,850
or drink it ourselves.

12
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,210
She also mentioned in the letter

13
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,030
that Prince Song treats her well.

14
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,720
She's taking care of the unborn child at home.

15
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,050
She told us not to worry.

16
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,180
How can you expect someone who has beaten her to change his nature?

17
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,880
We've sent several invitations to her.

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,750
But we were told she couldn't see anyone

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,810
and had to rest nine times out of ten.

20
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,250
In the few times we saw her,

21
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,980
it seemed everything was right,

22
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,840
but who knew what the real situation was?

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
Prince Song is now claiming

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,120
he's about to have his first son.

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,880
And he's been searching for tricks to ensure it's a boy.

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,540
His heart is now set on his son.

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,930
He won't do anything to Hao Jia for now.

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,920
I think so too.

29
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,510
Hao Jia said in her letter

30
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,530
that Prince Song treats her with the utmost care.

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,130
She doesn't seem to be lying.

32
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,480
I'm not sure how she'll be treated

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,020
after the baby is born though.

34
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,810
Jing.

35
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,770
Hao Jia said

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,460
she liked the diapers you and Prince Qi gave her.

37
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,650
What's wrong?

38
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,630
Those are the cotton pants we made.

39
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,280
Good for you.

40
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,130
Good workmanship.

41
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,580
Can you be more annoying?

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,570
I just did the accounting.

43
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,210
The restaurant has been making good money lately.

44
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,540
Our clothing store,

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,480
Mahjong Hall,

46
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,680
and the martial arts school are also doing well.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,620
So it seems

48
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,420
the women's Chamber of Commerce is promising.

49
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,320
If Hao Jia agrees,

50
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,579
let's also get her involved.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,579
Okay.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:22,960
Good.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,600
So...

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,090
Let me ask a question.

55
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,470
Why is he here?

56
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,660
His store went broke.

57
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,750
He's transferring his store to us.

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,910
We're going to build on the Women's Chamber of Commerce anyway.

59
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,240
We need a lot of space.

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,300
And his store is well located.

61
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,579
I agree.

62
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,200
Prince An.

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,400
Why don't you make an offer?

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,980
What offer?

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,540
I just want to open a store with you.

66
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,320
If you let me join you,

67
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,830
I'll give you the restaurant across the street.

68
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,220
I can't believe you're that kind.

69
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,880
It must be a trap.

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,640
No, it's not.

71
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,490
I swear.

72
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,660
You know.

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,540
I opened the restaurant

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,960
just to upset you.

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,920
Now that I'm out of business,

76
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,630
I don't have to spend any more time.

77
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,339
Why don't I give it to you?

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,920
But

79
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,210
I hope you can take me along

80
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,960
and let me have a share.

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,150
I knew Prince An couldn't suffer a loss.

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,780
Our family agrees.

83
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,830
So does Princess Shangguan.

84
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,350
So it's left to us.

85
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,860
Okay.

86
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,110
Let's take a stand.

87
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,310
Raise your hand if you want to let him go.

88
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,190
I mean.

89
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,950
You guys are cruel.

90
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,840
An.

91
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,720
It works

92
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,940
if you want to sincerely repent.

93
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,890
Since you are sincere,

94
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,490
we can't be merciful and let you go easily.

95
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,610
The men who join our Nine Regions Food Collection

96
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,630
must be judged on grooming.

97
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,810

99
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,090
Hold on.

100
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,820
Hold on.

101
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,710
Stand up straight.

102
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,360
Only by being tough enough for yourself

103
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,280
can you join the Nine Regions Food Collection.

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,490
Don't be lax.

105
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,690
Believe in yourself.

106
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,820
From today onwards,

107
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,440
you can't have a single grain of rice.

108
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,920
Next year, you will be able to hang on to the coins.

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,580
Breathe in.

110
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,550
Breathe.

111
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,159
Do it again.

112
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,770
Keep inhaling.

113
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,440
Hang in there.

114
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,240
Almost there.

Slim waist, burly arms.

116
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,409
The world is so cruel to men.

117
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,110
You're already inferior.

118
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,200
You have all the reasons to strive for excellence

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,150

for further glory.

121
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,920
You have such a thick waist.

122
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,440
Stick to a month of vegetables and you can lose weight.

123
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,700
Don't be discouraged.

124
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,140
How come you can't do such a simple pose?

125
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,960
What? Are you not convinced?

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,240
I am.

127
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,350
I am.

128
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,330
I just think

129
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,180
I didn't treat you right.

130
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,710
Forget it.

131
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,570
I'll forgive you

132
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,050
and spare your life.

133
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,240
I don't want to have New Year's Eve dinner in the palace this year.

134
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,720
Can I eat with you?

135
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,020
I was lonely

136
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,040
during the time you were away.

137
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,890
You can do it.

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,650
You should cook.

139
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,290
If it's not good,

140
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,440
redo it.

141
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,960
I'll learn.

Your Highness.

144
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,430
It's choking.

145
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,750
What's burning?

146
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,140
It's called daylily.

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
It's also known as male weed.

148
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,420
The falling of the bell is an omen for a baby boy.

149
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,020
It's all for the sake of a boy.

150
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,890
Bear with it.

151
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,840
Your Highness.

152
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,860
This is not good.

153
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,159
Her Ladyship is pregnant

154
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,890
with a daughter.

155
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,500
What?

156
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,050
Are you sure?

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,200
Absolutely.

158
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,810
Soak the pregnant woman in burning daylily smoke.

159
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,310
If the bell falls today,

160
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,970
she will give birth to a boy.

161
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,130
But the bell

162
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,160
has no sign of falling at all.

163
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,040
So Her Ladyship

164
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,900
must be pregnant with a girl.

165
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,040
Hey.

166
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,960
The child hasn't yet been born.

167
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,840
Are you so sure?

168
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,710
I'm sure I'm not wrong.

169
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,970
His Highness has used me for many years.

170
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,310
He knows it.

171
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,070
This kind of divination is absurd.

172
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,750
You can't say.

173
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,890
What a bummer!

174
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,000
Your Ladyship.

175
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,630
You must be worried about Prince Song's concubine.

176
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,290
I asked Yuan Ying to send an invitation today.

177
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,220
It was returned.

178
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,040
She always wrote back, saying she was fine.

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,660
But I'm always worried that she's not doing well.

180
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,520
Your Ladyship.

181
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Chief Steward Su?

182
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,200
Prince knows you are worried about Concubine Hao.

183
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
He ordered me to send a message

184
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,400
that you should

185
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,460
pay a visit to Prince Song 's mansion,

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,240
saying that Madam He sent you.

187
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,560
They dare not stop you.

188
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,750
Does it cause any trouble?

189
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,690
No.

190
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,970
The Prince has already taken care of it.

191
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,960
I think Madam He and Concubine Hao feel the same way.

192
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,810
Madam He is willing to help.

193
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,450
I'll get ready then.

194
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,860
Be careful.

195
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,360
Take care.

196
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,150
Her Ladyship is asleep.

197
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,450
She doesn't look asleep.

198
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,710
Wei.

199
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,620
Wei.

200
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,840
I haven't seen you for a long time.

201
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,810
What's wrong?

202
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,860
I'm fine.

203
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,990
I'm just pregnant.

204
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,290
I'm not feeling well.

205
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,490
It's normal.

206
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,920
Is it always like this when you're pregnant?

207
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,750
I don't know.

208
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,320
If you want to cry, cry out.

209
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,440
It's not good if you suppress your feelings.

210
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,260
With all the tonic food I'm taking,

211
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,830
I won't be in a bad shape.

212
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,100
After I got pregnant,

213
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Zhao Fangru allowed me to communicate with my family.

214
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,440
You see?

215
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,970
My mother wrote me so many letters.

216
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,020
She told me to take care of myself.

217
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,420
And the Prince must know about it.

218
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,920
But he turned a blind eye to it.

219
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,460
So he treated me fine.

220
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,980
Take care of yourself.

221
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,450
Prince Song is back.

222
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,680
Jia.

223
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,020
Guess what?

224
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,650
Why is she here?

225
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,430
Your Highness.

226
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,750
Li Wei has come all the way to visit me.

227
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,410
How many times have I told you?

228
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,300
You need to recuperate now.

229
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,350
You don't have to see the outsiders.

230
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,340
Lv Ming.

231
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,700
See her off.

232
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,320
I'll leave now.

233
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,650
Jia.

234
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,390
Guess what?

235
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,800
Zhang has another trick up her sleeve.

236
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,600
You can still give birth to a boy.

237
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,270
Why aren't you happy about it?

238
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,160
You are carrying our baby.

239
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,490
Rest well.

240
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,360
Lie down.

241
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,250
I'll stay with you.

242
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,280
Your Highness.

243
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,580
She's been digging for so long.

244
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,470
She may get the keel later.

245
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,160
She's going to wreck her hand.

246
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,190
What's wrong?

247
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
It didn't go well?

248
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,470
I heard at the court today

249
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,580
Brother Song is going to give His Majesty a first-born grandson.

250
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,640
He must have spread the news himself.

251
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,840
He's been doing all those blind worship,

252
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,500
asking for a son with a reward.

253
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,730
That day,

254
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,620
that day at the restaurant, we should have…

255
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,510
We wanted to let Hao Jia escape.

256
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,270
But we found out she was pregnant.

257
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,560
She couldn't even leave.

258
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,170
Prince Song even beat her up

259
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,380
and locked her up in the house,

260
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,470
claiming it's good for Hao Jia.

261
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,730
I think he is bullshit!

262
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,210
Hao Jia now cries every day.

263
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,440
I regret it.

264
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,360
I should've let her escape anyway.

265
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,790
Once domestic violence starts,

266
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,790
it'll never stop.

267
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,690
If she can leave,

268
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,050
it'd be the best for her.

269
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,330
She's in such emotional turmoil.

270
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,660
Should we call a doctor?

271
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,530
Your Highness.

272
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,670
Do you remember I once told you

273
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,080
Madam He was also in a bad mood and cried a lot,

274
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
she even sent you to the servant’s room

275
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,920
after you were born?

276
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,010
Could Concubine Hao and Madam He...

277
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,370
I'll get the doctor.

278
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,910
It's up to you

279
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,850
as for how to send him in.

280
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,570
Go.

281
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,560
I understand.

282
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,400
Stop.

283
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,370
The vegetables in my house grow well.

284
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,740
I've brought some to Your Ladyship.

285
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,320
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,120
Her Ladyship is pregnant.

287
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,530
I don't dare to accept anything from outside

288
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,100
in case it ruins Prince's son.

289
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,560
Don't you know my relationship with Hao Jia?

290
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,680
Would I harm her?

291
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,770
Please forgive me.

292
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,280
These are just some vegetables.

293
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,150
Let her in.

294
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,610
It's Lady Zhao's wish.

295
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,810
If anything happens,

296
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,490
let the Prince go to her.

297
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,080
Yes.

298
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,320
This place is hidden.

299
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,380
Let the person in the barrel come out.

300
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
There's indeed rape in this barrel.

301
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,860
But this is the doctor I hired.

302
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,520
Go.

303
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,540
Sister.

304
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,930
Let me ask one more question.

305
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,860
Why is Lady Zhao willing to help us?

306
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,190
Concubine Hao is not well.

307
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,910
Her Ladyship knows this can't work.

308
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,240
It would harm the child.

309
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,620
Her Ladyship loves children.

310
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,890
But she can't get pregnant.

311
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,040
Now that Concubine Hao is pregnant

312
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,240
and she is concerned,

313
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,900
she hopes that the mother and child are safe.

314
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,650
Please thank her for me.

315
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,530
These fruits have seeds.

316
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,210
You should eat more.

317
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,610
I'm sure you'll have a big baby boy later.

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,860
Your Highness.

319
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,810
I don't like sour food.

320
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,580
Yes,

321
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,470
you do.

322
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:38,890
All right.

323
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,390
You should rest well.

324
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,730
After you give birth to our son,

325
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,640
I'll take you

326
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,120
wherever you want to go.

327
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,420
Remember to eat all these.

328
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,350
Yes.

329
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,310
Your Ladyship.

330
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,720
Your Ladyship.

331
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,000
Your Ladyship.

332
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,099
Hao Jia.

333
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,000
Wei.

334
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,089
Why are you here?

335
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,240
What's wrong?

336
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,480
Sit down.

337
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,030
I've brought a doctor.

338
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,310
Are you all right?

339
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,950
It's only been a few days.

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,770
Why have you become like this?

341
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,290
That day, the divine woman concluded

342
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,390
Her Ladyship was pregnant with a daughter.

343
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,920
His Highness was not happy.

344
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,560
But the child was not yet born.

345
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,890
So there was still hope.

346
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,760
His Highness always asked the divine woman

347
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,970
to send the incense to pray for a boy.

348
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,600
Her Ladyship was upset but didn't dare to say anything.

349
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,330
So she always cried by herself.

350
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,650
Her Ladyship is depressed during pregnancy.

351
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,130
Many wives, after conception,

352
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,320
will have stagnant qi and blood, and a depressed mind.

353
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,480
Over time,

354
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,360
they become depressed.

355
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,590
This room is closed

356
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,530
with incense burning.

357
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,330
People must get uncomfortable.

358
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,560
Pregnant women need to go out during the day

359
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,390
and keep a good mood.

360
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,600
It's not a good idea

361
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,400
to stay cooped up all day like this.

362
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,460
Thank you, doctor.

363
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,410
I don't know what to do.

364
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,710
I chose this life

365
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,360
of relying on others.

366
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,480
This is my punishment,

367
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,690
but not my child.

368
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,500
Prince Song knows he has no talent.

369
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,050
But he has to pretend.

370
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,510
He walks on thin ice and trembles

371
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,840
under his father’s watchful eye.

372
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,450
Is my child going to be like this?

373
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,030
And she’s born by a concubine like me.

374
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,620
Life is so hard.

375
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,090
I can live on my knees.

376
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,050
But she can’t.

377
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,870
When you tried to help me run away,

378
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,040
I thought I could start a new life.

379
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,650
I never thought…

380
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,250
I never thought…

381
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,480
And now,

382
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,200
I might be in this cage

383
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,090
for the rest of my life.

384
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,700
Is death

385
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,920
the only way to end all this?

386
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,410
Wei.

387
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,700
No, it's not.

388
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,120
What should I do?

389
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,530
No.

390
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,050
No.

391
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,330
Today we are all here

392
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,050
to discuss Hao Jia escaping the mansion.

393
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,950
We can take her out of the mansion and send her out of the city.

394
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,280
The problem is the subsequent placement.

395
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,480
If Hao Jia is missing,

396
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
Prince Song must suspect us.

397
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,710
If he confronts us,

398
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,800
Li Wei and I will deal with it.

399
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,840
But if he sends someone to find Hao Jia,

400
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,720
Li Wei's house in Jichuan will be the first to suffer.

401
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,580
So we need someone to provide an alternative location

402
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,310
to ensure the safety of Hao Jia.

403
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,160
I don't want to get everyone involved.

404
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,690
But Yuan Ying from Jinchuan

405
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,490
can't make a move either.

406
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,400
So I ask for your help.

407
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,600
If you do not want to…

408
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,400
All right.

409
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,140
Save it.

410
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,140
If Yin Song finds out what's going on,

411
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,440
say it was my idea.

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,740
How about this?

413
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,020
I'll pay for Hao Jia's expenses.

414
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,750
I'll pay too.

415
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,560
Why don't

416
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,050
all four of us pay for it?

417
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,040
Who would be afraid of Yin Song?

418
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,840
That's right.

419
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,410
Although I don't think we'll die,

420
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,000
what if?

421
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,870
We'll be sisters again in our next life then.

422
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,750
That's right.

423
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,490
We need to know that this is dangerous.

424
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,870
If someone is dragged down,

425
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,410
Hao Jia will suffer more.

426
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,880
I'll take care of this.

427
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,040
Please try to protect yourselves.

428
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,170
What does that mean?

429
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,240
How can I stand by and do nothing about this?

430
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,530
If the people of Danchuan find out,

431
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,330
I'll be laughed at for the rest of my life.

432
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,700
Here.

433
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,760
This is the rations and food prepared by Si.

434
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,560
I put the token of Danchuan in it.

435
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,970
If Jichuan is not safe,

436
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,960
ask Hao Jia to go to Danchuan Palace.

437
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,020
My sister will take care of her for us.

438
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,320
Don't worry.

439
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,910
Most of the farms in Yingchuan are ours.

440
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,040
We can let Hao Jia live there.

441
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,920
Cunning rabbits have multiple caves.

442
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,320
Yingchuan is a big place.

443
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,370
It will take a long time to find her.

444
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,710
Thank you all.

445
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,800
This is settled.

446
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,080
Su Shen said you wanted to see me.

447
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
Sit down.

448
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,620
I want to let Hao Jia go.

449
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,120
She is so poor.

450
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,560
After she married Prince Song,

451
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,470
I watched

452
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,340
her turn depressed

453
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,210
from a bright and cheerful person.

454
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,450
I can't stand by and do nothing.

455
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,180
Have you thought it over?

456
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,040
But releasing a girl with palace papers is a big deal.

457
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,560
Prince Song won't let it go.

458
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,290
I can't drag you into this.

459
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,020
Can you write me a letter of repudiation

460
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,280
to clear your name first?

461
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm sorry.

462
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,800
I have no other choice.

463
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,570
Only we feel truly empathetic for her.

464
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,760
Except for us,

465
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,080
no one else can save her.

466
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,140
[No way]

467
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,300
You can do whatever you want to do.

468
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,250
But

469
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,900
don't say it again.

470
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,800
Thank you.

471
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,470
I just think

472
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,820
it's hard enough for you.

473
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,080
If anything else happens because of me,

474
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,880
I'll feel so guilty.

475
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,480
Don't be afraid of anything.

476
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,520
I'm here.

477
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,610
I'm leaving so carelessly.

478
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,190
Will you be all right?

479
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,010
Don't worry.

480
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,900
People are waiting in the car.

481
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,340
Jia.

482
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,380
Mother.

483
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,100
Jia.

484
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,370
Mother.

485
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,390
Why are you here?

486
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,680
As soon as I received your letter,

487
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,460
[Hao Jia's mother]

488
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,850
I rushed over here.

489
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,500
Luckily, I was able to give you a ride in time.

490
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,070
Mother.

491
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,590
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,030
I wanted to stay in Prince Song 's mansion.

493
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,070
I wanted to live a good life.

494
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,970
But…

495
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,280
Aunt brought a driver from home.

496
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,230
He's very reliable.

497
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,010
Don't worry.

498
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,650
I've prepared everything for the journey

499
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,830
back to Jichuan.

500
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,570
Go to my house first to avoid the storm.

501
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,500
We'll talk about the future later.

502
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,340
Wei.

503
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
I don't know how to thank you.

504
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,480
It's a great kindness…

505
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,280
It's nothing,

506
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,470
as long as you live happily ever after.

507
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,890
Even if it's for the sake of the child.

508
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,990
I've already thought through it.

509
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,220
Her name will be Changle.

510
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,220
It means long-lasting peace and happiness.

511
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,030
When she is born,

512
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,980
I'd like you to be her godmother.

513
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:10,770
Good.

514
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,520
I will be a good godmother.

515
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,680
But you have to love yourself more.

516
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,640
Otherwise, how can you love others?

517
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,770
It's a big world.

518
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,340
You will live a free and easy life.

519
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,120
Don't cry.

520
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,120
Go on.

521
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,370
Go.

522
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,590
Auntie.

523
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:38,990
Good.

524
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,190
Mother.

525
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,400
It's been a long journey.

526
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,260
Come here.

527
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,250
Have some water.

528
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,180
What’s wrong, Mother?

529
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,180
Jia.

530
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,730
Have you ever thought about

531
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,830
once you leave,

532
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,700
how should you live in the future?

533
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,380
Since you married Prince Song,

534
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,220
the money you gave us

535
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,740
were all offered by him.

536
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,810
But once you're gone,

537
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,960
what will you do to make a living?

538
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,210
Mother.

539
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,770
Don't worry about that.

540
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,330
Li Wei and the girls are doing great business now.

541
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,070
They're making a fortune.

542
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,260
I can work with them in the future.

543
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,390
How can I not be worried?

544
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,560
You're different from Li Wei.

545
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,680
Prince Zheng only has one wife.

546
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,680
And he loves Li Wei so much.

547
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,740
You said it yourself.

548
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,180
Li Wei's husband

549
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,890
is very good to her.

550
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,860
If anything happens to her,

551
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,820
her husband has plenty of people to help her out.

552
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,920
But we don't have anything.

553
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,880
You mean

554
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,150
you want me to go back?

555
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,030
How can I not wish you well?

556
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,300
But once you leave

557
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,250
and Prince Song asks me for you,

558
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,500
what about me and your father?

559
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,290
Prince Xinchuan would be furious.

560
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,380
If Lord Yanchuan aims at your father,

561
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,280
our family won't be able to live.

562
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,830
That's why you came all the way here.

563
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,700
It's not for seeing me off.

564
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,200
But you wrote so many letters to me,

565
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,000
asking me to take care of myself.

566
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,340
You're trying to use me?

567
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,260
How can I be using you?

568
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,830
There are so many girls in our family.

569
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,030
I had to go through a lot of trouble to send you to Xinchuan.

570
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,710
Luckily, you're doing well.

571
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,980
You met Prince Song

572
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,000
and you're pregnant with his child.

573
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,720
It's been a long time coming.

574
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,310
You should take care of yourself.

575
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,500
Jia.

576
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,200
I know

577
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,620
Prince Song is not good to you.

578
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,160
I also feel sorry for you.

579
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,870
But with him protecting us,

580
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,410
we have someone to back us up.

581
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,180
That's all a woman can do for the rest of her life.

582
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,540
Her husband is her landlord.

583
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,760
It's always hard

584
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,980
to beg for food with the landlord.

585
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Bear with it.

586
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,840
I'm counting on you for the rest of my life.

587
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,300
Your Highness.

588
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,750
What's with the panic?

589
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,220
What are you doing?

590
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,230
I'm...

591
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,020
Where is Her Ladyship?

592
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,430
Her Ladyship…

593
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,610
Where is she?

594
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,220
Lv Ming.

595
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,400
I've gone to make tea for Your Highness.

596
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,400
I heard from the servants that Your Highness is busy with government affairs

597
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,890
and is sleepless at night.

598
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,680
I've made some tea to calm your mind.

599
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,040
Good tea.

600
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,710
You are pregnant.

601
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,270
And you're still thinking of me?

602
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,020
Leave this

603
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,470
to the servants.

604
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,210
I always think of

605
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,590
doing something for Your Highness.

606
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,550
I made Your Highness unhappy a while ago.

607
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,550
I am afraid that the child in my belly

608
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,170
won't satisfy you.

609
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,950
But don't worry, Your Highness.

610
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,380
I will take good care of my body from now on

611
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,840
and listen to the advice of the divine woman Zhang.

612
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,300
I'll try my best to give birth to a son for you.

613
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,790
You...

614
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,760
If only you could always be so obedient.

615
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,690
I can't stay long.

616
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,690
I'll see you again in a few days.

617
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,830
Take care, Your Highness.

618
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,870
Good tea.

619
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,640
Your Ladyship.

620
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,900
Why are you back again?

621
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,760
Didn't Lady Zhao turn a blind eye

622
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,660
and let you go?

623
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,940
My mother was right.

624
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,220
I'm a woman with a child.

625
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,870
I can't survive.

626
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,440
Besides, I'm nothing.

627
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,219
Why should I drag you into this?

628
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,409
I run away.

629
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,679
His Highness must be furious.

630
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,300
Lady Zhao can protect you,

631
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,110
but you'll still suffer.

632
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,969
I won't run away.

633
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,040
So we'd all be safe and sound.

634
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,830
Even if I give birth to a daughter,

635
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,010
I think His Highness will be grateful for the love of the past

636
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,409
and take care of her.

637
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:01,860
My mother brought me up to be what I am today.

638
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,860
I can only be a canary,

639
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,220
a bird in a cage.

640
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,460
I cannot live alone.

641
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,930
I'm the same as

642
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,750
Prince Song.

643
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,140
He relies on

644
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,450
Madam's family.

645
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,150
I've dragged Li Wei, the girls and you all into this.

646
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,480
We are all incompetent people.

647
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,160
Death in this house

648
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,680
is my final destination.

649
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,160
Hao Jia asked me to return it to you,

650
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,290
saying she's grateful.

651
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,620
I was stupid.

652
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,810
I thought her mother was here to help her.

653
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,150
According to Lv Ming,

654
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,970
she was pushed by her mother instead.

655
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,130
Hao Jia's mother

656
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,990
probably just wanted

657
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,280
her to marry into a rich family

658
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,800
to bless the whole family.

659
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,170
What kind of mother is this?

660
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,920
Her daughter has already had such a miserable life.

661
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,650
She still forced her to endure?

662
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,520
Hao Jia is different from us.

663
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,370
To be frank,

664
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,800
we grow up with no worries.

665
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,530
Of course we have the power.

666
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,790
But Hao Jia has always lived off other people's attitudes.

667
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,240
She must have experienced

668
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
a lot of

669
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,380
hard feelings.

670
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,740
So

671
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,070
she doesn't dare to do

672
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,810
what she wants to do.

673
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,850
Hao Jia has no family

674
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,330
that can support her

675
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,390
in case she falls.

676
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,570
Things have been so.

677
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,470
From now on,

678
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,730
we are her family.

679
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,660
We'll hold her up.

680
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,740
It hurts.

681
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,290
It hurts too much.

682
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,600
Lady Zhao has invited a midwife.

683
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,730
She'll be here soon.

684
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,760
I don't want to give birth.

685
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,090
It hurts too much.

686
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,370
The midwife is coming.

687
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,840
It hurts too much.

688
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,720
The fetus is not in the right position.

689
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,930
Her Ladyship has been taking too many supplements during pregnancy.

690
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,840
The baby is too big.

691
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,240
I'm afraid it'll be hard.

692
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,590
Then what should we do?

693
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,000
We'd better ask a doctor for an injection to stop the pain.

694
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,670
A doctor?

695
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,020
I'll go to Lady Zhao

696
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,200
and ask His Highness to get a doctor for her.

697
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,530
Okay.

698
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,060
Hurry.

699
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,530
Go change the hot water.

700
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,920
Yin Zheng thinks that he is the assistant director of the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

701
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,080
He wants to implement the new currency in the nine regions

702
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,550
and has reached the Ministry of Revenue.

703
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,010
Father even praised him from time to time.

704
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,720
How many times have I told you?

705
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,440
I told you to find out what he's up to.

706
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,840
Brother, don't be angry.

707
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,200
I can't help it.

708
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,440
He's done a good job with everything he's handled.

709
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,160
Even if he's involved in the new currency,

710
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,680
it's under Father's approval.

711
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,880
It's not an overstep.

712
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,920
Yin Zheng has a deep mind and is discreet.

713
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,230
I have so many eyes on him.

714
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:39,800
But...

715
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,820
But they can't find anything wrong with him.

716
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,990
Can't find it?

717
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,090
Make it then.

718
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,370
For the past six months,

719
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,080
Father has been dissatisfied with you and me.

720
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,840
He thinks Yin Zheng is more upbeat.

721
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,380
Brother.

722
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,510
I'm afraid it's not a good time

723
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,530
to make a move now.

724
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,990
Your Highness.

725
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,200
Your Highness.

726
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,000
Her Ladyship is in labor.

727
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,520
Why do you come to me for this?

728
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,680
Her Ladyship is in severe pain.

729
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,400
She has no more strength

730
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,360
and can't hold on.

731
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,490
The midwife said she could use

732
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,710
a couple of injections from a doctor.

733
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,440
Maybe it will stop the pain.

734
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,190
Is there a woman who doesn't have pain during childbirth?

735
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,920
How do you know if the needles will hurt the fetus?

736
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Tell her to bear it.

737
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,350
Yes.

738
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,600
Wait a minute.

739
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,820
If it's a boy,

740
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,480
report to me.

741
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,110
Yes.

742
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,310
Push!

743
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,310
Push! Hurry!

744
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,010
Your Ladyship, push!

745
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,200
Your Ladyship.

746
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,440
His Highness won't allow the needle to stop the pain.

747
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,800
Her Ladyship's condition is getting worse.

748
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,130
We don't know what to do.

749
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,920
Harder. Quick.

750
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,910
Hurry up.

751
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:44,940
Hao Jia.

752
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,960
Pull yourself together!

753
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,760
Don't give up!

754
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,840
Your Ladyship, stay here.

755
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,080
She is about to give birth.

756
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,480
If you don't go in, she'll die.

757
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:55,880
Get out of the way!

758
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,480
Prince Song has ordered.

759
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,440
No one is allowed inside.

760
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,560
Do you know who we are?

761
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,320
It doesn't matter who you are.

762
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,040
Prince Song has said

763
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,400
no one is allowed in today.

764
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,330
Get out of my way!

765
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,580
Your Ladyship.

766
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,610
Your Ladyship.

767
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,350
If I die...

768
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,520
Can you take care of my child…

769
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,030
No.

770
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:15,740
Listen to me!

771
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,680
If you dare to die in my house

772
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,900
and get me bad luck,

773
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,760
I will torture your child to death.

774
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,030
I won't let her grow up.

775
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,380
You must live,

776
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,780
so you can keep an eye on me.

777
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,840
Do you understand?

778
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,940
Your Ladyship.

779
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,270
It doesn't work.

780
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,620
She can't give birth.

781
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,270
Don't panic yet.

782
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,390
Doctor Xu can't come now.

783
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,880
Do you know which acupuncture points on her body are for pain relief?

784
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,110
Give her the needles now.

785
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,620
She must have the strength to give birth to the baby.

786
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,000
I do know.

787
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,130
But

788
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,550
Prince Song won't let me.

789
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,410
That's enough!

790
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,090
You must know

791
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I am the only mistress of this house.

792
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,360
Even Hao Jia's life is in the charge of me.

793
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,820
Do not hesitate.

794
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,720
Place the needles.

795
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,170
Okay.

796
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,480
Your Ladyship.

797
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,170
I'm sorry.

798
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,520
It hurts!

799
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,410
Your Ladyship, hurry up!

800
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,670
I see the child's head.

801
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,450
Hao Jia.

802
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:17,940
Remember.

803
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,850
Nether you

804
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,360
nor the child

805
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,310
should die today!

806
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,590
Your Ladyship.

807
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,060
Harder!

808
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,590
It's already dark.

809
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,230
Why is there no news?

810
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,570
She’s finished.

811
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,790
Her Ladyship has given birth to a daughter.

812
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,590
That's great.

813
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,800
How is Hao Jia?

814
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,110
Her Ladyship is fine.

815
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,440
The mother and the daughter are both safe.

816
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,200
It's good that they're safe.

817
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,850
Please go back first.

818
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,000
The Prince is not in a good mood today.

819
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,650
He won't let anyone into the house.

820
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,490
Lady Zhao will take care of Concubine Hao.

821
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,890
Everything will be fine.

822
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:27,940
Then, please

823
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,390
take this amulet to Hao Jia.

824
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,960
Good girl.

825
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,770
Good girl.

826
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,610
When she was born,

827
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,740
she was crying all the time.

828
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,770
Now she's asleep.

829
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,200
She doesn't make a fuss anymore.

830
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,030
You see?

831
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,130
She doesn't look like me at all.

832
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,610
More like her father.

833
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,720
It's okay.

834
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,630
Just let her spend more time with us.

835
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
After a long time,

836
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,570
when she grows up,

837
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,290
she'll be free of

838
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,040
those bad habits of Yin Song.

839
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,040
Right?

840
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,770
From now on,

841
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,300
I never want to see that man again.

842
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,890
I had his baby.

843
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,440
I almost lost my life.

844
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,080
He wouldn't even give me a painkiller.

845
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,110
When he found out it was a girl,

846
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,180
he disappeared.

847
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,950
I'm no better than a shabby shoe.

848
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,210
Have you thought about

849
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,440
what to name this baby?

850
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,610
The nickname is Changle.

851
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,650
The official name is Hao Yue.

852
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,110
Her Ladyship.

853
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,560
If His Highness knows

854
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,480
the baby's name is Yin Haoyue

855
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,570
with your mother's family name,

856
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,130
I'm afraid he won't like it.

857
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:02,860
No.

858
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,540
Not Yin Haoyue.

859
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,250
Just Hao Yue.

860
