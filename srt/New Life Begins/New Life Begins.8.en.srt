[New Life Begins]

2
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,810
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,370
Madam Danchuan.

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,250
I want to marry you.

5
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,950
Are you surprised?

6
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,000
Danchuan needs Xinchuan's help.

7
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,870
Xinchuan needs Danchuan's marriage.

8
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,759
That's why Prince Qi and Jing were forced to get married.

9
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,380
But now she doesn't want it.

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,340
I'll complete the marriage between the two regions.

11
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,420
Isn't that a happy ending?

12
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,440
The marriage letter has been drafted.

13
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,650
If you are willing,

14
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,060
I'll ask someone to send this marriage letter to Xinchuan immediately.

15
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,000
Once the decree of marriage proposal is sent to Xinchuan,

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,260
our father will definitely abandon you.

17
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,090
Madam Danchuan,

18
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,530
forgive me for being foolish.

19
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,990
I really don't understand

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,170
what your intention is.

21
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,180
I didn't expect that

22
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,579
for my first time to confess my love to a man,

23
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,490
he didn't believe it at all.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
But Prince Zheng,

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,510
what I said

26
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,920
are sincere words.

27
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,410
Thank you for your appreciation.

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,660
But I'm already married.

29
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,990
I can't betray or abandon my wife.

30
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,170
But I've heard from Ms. Li that

31
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,320
you were forced to get married

32
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,800
like Prince Qi and Jing, and have no feelings towards each other.

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,170
What's more, she doesn't like you at all.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,579
My decree

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,200
will not only protect the alliance through marriage

36
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,880
but also make Ms. Li's and Jing's

37
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,810
forced marriages end in a good way.

38
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,290
Isn't that a happen ending?

39
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,680
Although we were ordered to get married,

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,170
I really like Li Wei.

41
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,320
If she doesn't like me,

42
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,700
I won't force her.

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,930
But Madam Danchuan,

44
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,980
please don't force me.

45
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,900
I've just found out

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,610
how Prince Zheng feels.

47
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,440
He's a nice guy.

48
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,370
We can try to get along.

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,180
I don't want to part with Prince Zheng so easily.

50
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,650
Madam Danchuan, please show mercy.

51
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:29,830
Sister.

52
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,780
Don't separate them.

53
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,650
Sister.

54
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,080
If you separate them now,

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,330
Prince Zheng and Li Wei won't be happy.

56
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,780
It's enough now for this big fuss.

57
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,480
Let me go back with Prince Qi.

58
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,090
I shouldn't have come back willfully.

59
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,520
Jing,

60
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,500
I know you care about the alliance of our two regions.

61
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,010
But if you don't want it...

62
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,120
I want it, sister.

63
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,410
Prince Qi is not bad.

64
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,640
He looks ordinary,

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,160
and he's both stupid and foolish

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
with a bad temper and impatient personality,

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,740
being neither gentle nor considerate.

68
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,580
His physique is bad, too.

69
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,640
He can't even beat me in the fighting.

70
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,100
Well...

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,250
Talk about the content after "but".

72
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,760
But

73
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,250
he is kind of a good man.

74
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
What do you mean by "kind of a good man"?

75
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,460
I...

76
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,430
Anyway, we can go on living with each other.

77
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
He doesn't dare to do anything to me.

78
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,040
Moreover,

79
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,740
I quite like Xinchuan.

80
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,730
I have Li Wei and other friends there.

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,020
So, sister,

82
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,110
don't make things difficult for them.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,670
Got it.

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,880
Prince Qi.

85
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,920
My sister used to smile a lot.

86
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,780
But somehow,

87
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,800
after she went to Xinchuan,

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,840
I've never seen her happy again.

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,130
If you're the one who can make Jing laugh happily,

90
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,660
I'll allow you

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,430
to take Jing back.

92
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,480
Laugh happily.

93
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,920
I have to make her laugh happily.

94
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,100
How do you think I can make Shangguan Jing happy?

95
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,440
Are they...

96
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,930
Can you two stop holding hands?

97
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,159
Although I said that, I...

98
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:47,860
I know.

99
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,690
No need to explain.

100
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,230
You said you like me

101
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,560
because you don't want to be a matrilocal husband.

102
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,290
Don't worry.

103
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,960
I won't imagine myself as the one you love.

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,040
What's wrong with you?

105
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,200
Do you have a stomachache?

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,710
I didn't ask you to eat spicy food.

107
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,660
Zheng

108
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,520
has always been quiet.

109
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,860
But you're really something.

110
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,890
You've really made him so angry that he has a stomachache.

111
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,560
Let me do it.

112
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,790
You do it.

113
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,120
Does it hurt?

114
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,960
Let me help you massage it.

115
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,820
Don't touch me.

116
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,930
Is this true?

117
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,820
Did you deliberately draw the attention of others?

118
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,690
Take it back.

119
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,490
Let me help you massage it.

120
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,320
Your Highness, you didn't sleep all night, did you?

121
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
Even if you had killed yourself by staying up so late,

122
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
it wouldn't help.

123
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,180
How do you think I can make Shangguan Jing laugh?

124
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,820
She was born with a poker face.

125
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,640
She's trying to make things difficult for me.

126
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,510
Your Highness, don't describe her like that.

127
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,040
She laughs a lot in the inner court study hall.

128
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm not eating.

129
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,010
Where are you going?

130
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
There are so many men in Danchuan who can please their wives.

131
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
I'll learn from them.

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,570
I'll go with you.

133
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,179
Stabilize it.

134
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,070
It hurts, master.

135
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,960
With your look like that, how can you learn it?

136
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,890
Raise your head.

137
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,159
Straighten your chest.

138
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,780
So this is your idea?

139
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,320
Learn the art of fast mask-changing.

140
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,130
Prince Qi said Jing likes the art of fast mask-changing.

141
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,790
Just cater to her preference.

142
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,620
But can he learn it?

143
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,430
He said

144
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,060
he would eat two bowls of chili if he couldn't master the skill.

145
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,730
He's so determined.

146
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,110
With your look like that, how can you learn it?

147
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,680
Stop!

148
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,680
Master.

149
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm stupid,

150
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
and I'll get stupider and stupider as you hit me.

151
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,700
Stop!

152
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,370
Again.

153
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,040
You'll kill me.

154
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,100
No, I can't learn it.

155
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,720
Let me tell you.

156
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,330
Zheng.

157
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,160
Your Highness, are you alright?

158
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,070
He'll kill me.

159
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,720
No. He'll kill me like this. Let me tell you.

160
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,280
We have to go back.

161
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,080
Look. He hit me and my hand got hurt.

162
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,860
I can't learn this.

163
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,430
Master,

164
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,600
you can't hit my brother.

165
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,400
Why are you...

166
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,000
Zheng, why did you...

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,110
What are you doing?

168
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,290
Your Highness.

169
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,580
Your Highness, hang in there.

170
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,090
Zheng.

171
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,320
We can't go back to Xinchuan if you don't master the skill.

172
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,080
Actually, I understand why

173
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Jing doesn't want to go back with us.

174
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,480
After all, Xinchuan is not as comfortable as Danchuan.

175
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,010
I always play this with Li Cang in Jichuan.

176
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,290
I'm very good at it.

177
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,720
I've never lost.

178
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,740
Are you homesick?

179
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,330
Of course.

180
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,420
When our agreement expires,

181
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,980
what are you going to do after you go back?

182
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,340
I may get married

183
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,670
and live like my parents.

184
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,890
That person will make a lot of delicious food.

185
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,140
When we are in trouble,

186
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,160
we will help each other

187
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,850
and discuss it with each other,

188
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,730
never leaving each other behind.

189
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,720
I hope he'll be someone...

190
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,840
whom I like

191
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,320
and who also likes me.

192
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,340
I lost.

193
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,880
Your Highness, please come.

194
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,440
Yes.

195
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,700
Let me tell you.

196
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,880
Prince Qi has been learning it for you for a long time.

197
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,040
His master has hit him many times,

198
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,440
but he has never given up.

199
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
It's tough for him.

200
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,160
Please watch it.

201
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,830
Just one glance.

202
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,300
Right.

203
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,720
Come on.

204
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,830
Have a seat.

205
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,120
I said I don't want to come.

206
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,980
Your Highness.

207
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,520
Prince Qi has tried all his best to ask for your forgiveness.

208
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,920
Please give him a chance.

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,530
Watch it.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,860
Where is he?

211
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,860
A few days ago, he followed me around every day.

212
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,290
I had to see him even if I didn't want to.

213
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,680
Then he disappeared for several days.

214
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,530
He asked me to come here but he keeps me waiting.

215
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,260
I won't wait.

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,610
It begins.

217
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,370
He's coming.

218
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,890
Prince Qi wants to perform the show of fast mask-changing for you.

219
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,920
Has he changed his mask?

220
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,120
Yes.

221
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,100
His expression changed, right?

222
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,710
Yes.

223
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,320
He has so many expressions.

224
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,840
Forget it. I won't watch it.

225
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,040
I'm going to get changed.

226
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,900
Your Highness.

227
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,400
Don't go.

228
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,440
He changed his mask. He really changed it.

229
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,080
Look.

230
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,440
Shangguan Jing.

231
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,100
Shangguan.

232
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,570
Sorry, Shangguan.

233
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
I've been learning it for a long time.

234
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,720
I wanted to make you happy,

235
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
but I still failed in the end.

236
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,730
Since you're here,

237
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,970
please listen to me.

238
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,930
Just a few words.

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,930
Just say it.

240
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,580
Okay.

241
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,840
I want to apologize to you.

242
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,440
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,150
I shouldn't have made a request like that.

244
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,420
Actually on that day,

245
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,260
I made the spicy moon cake for you

246
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,650
not only because I wanted to make you happy

247
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,940
and make that improper request,

248
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,560
but also because I thought it was the Mid-Autumn Festival.

249
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,690
I know that your days wear on like years

250
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,830
in Xinchuan.

251
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,940
I was afraid you might miss home,

252
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,210
so I prepared that flavor specially.

253
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,960
I just wanted you to be happy.

254
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,330
You remember

255
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,540
what I've said before?

256
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,440
What is it?

257
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,170
Shangguan.

258
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,800
I remember it.

259
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,840
I remember everything.

260
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,040
No. You said too much.

261
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,230
You've said things like

262
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,000
"I like spicy food very much", "While I'm alive, the spear will always be with me",

263
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,780
"No one is allowed to get close during my practice",

264
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,440
"It's not easy to fry the chicken if it's cut into big pieces",

265
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,920
"Don't add sugar while stirring food",

266
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,280
"My name is Shangguan Jing, not Shangguan Qian",

267
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,680
and "I like watching fast mask-changing".

268
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,580
Which one?

269
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,420
You smiled.

270
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,070
You smiled.

271
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,070
You finally smiled.

272
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,490
Great!

273
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,810
You finally smiled.

274
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,170
She smiled.

275
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,300
She smiled.

276
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,550
Your Highness.

277
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,900
Shangguan.

278
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,280
Do you know

279
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,310
you look pretty when you smile?

280
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,470
Zheng!

281
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,150
As Jing said,

282
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,810
she has her own responsibility

283
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,150
and her own decision.

284
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,540
Shangguan,

285
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,310
I know

286
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,720
you said you would go back with me

287
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,690
so as to help

288
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,680
Li Wei and Zheng solve the awkward situation.

289
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,280
Of course,

290
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,370
you did it for the sake of Danchuan, too.

291
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,700
But what I want to say is

292
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,200
don't care about the alliance of the nine regions.

293
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,060
I know you well.

294
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,200
You want freedom.

295
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,240
You want to travel the world with your sword.

296
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,040
I support you.

297
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,680
If you ask me to let you go,

298
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,670
I can do that.

299
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,490
Though my father may punish me,

300
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,040
it's okay.

301
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
I'll make it through.

302
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,890
If you really want to leave,

303
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,540
just leave.

304
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,210
It's okay.

305
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm not a person who thinks lightly of loyalty.

306
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,140
I said I would go back with you.

307
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,839
I'll definitely go back with you.

308
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,300
Really?

309
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,300
Okay.

310
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,440
Good.

311
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,920
Thanks for your help in advance.

312
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,160
Princes,

313
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,930
your mission to Danchuan has been completed successfully.

314
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,440
I've specially prepared a farewell banquet

315
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,670
to see you off.

316
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Thank you, Ma'am.

317
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,280
I've been walking around Danchuan these several days to check the hydrology,

318
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,070
and summarized eight measures for flood prevention.

319
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,730
I hope they can help Danchuan.

320
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Ask the local fishermen to be the main force of observation.

321
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,970
Let the people take part in the flood prevention.

322
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,500
It's indeed a good measure.

323
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,560
It's better to prevent flood than to control flood.

324
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,000
If Danchuan needs anything,

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,130
Xinchuan will spare no effort to help.

326
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,590
I was right about you.

327
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,880
Let's start the banquet.

328
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,720
Prince Qi.

329
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,960
Although my sister is willing to go back to Xinchuan with you,

330
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,070
I still hope

331
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,500
you won't forget your pledge.

332
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,760
If you dare to take a concubine during the marriage with my sister,

333
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,090
I will make sure that you have no offspring

334
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,930
and can't perform the function as a man anymore.

335
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,640
Madam Danchuan,

336
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,370
don't worry.

337
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,510
If Prince Qi treats Jing badly,

338
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,960
let him come back to Danchuan and be a matrilocal husband.

339
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,400
That depends on your performance, Prince Qi.

340
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,120
I'll do it well.

341
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,650
I'll definitely do it well.

342
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,500
Everyone, have a safe journey.

343
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,680
Prince Qi, use some strength.

344
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,060
A step.

345
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,120
Use some strength.

346
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,900
Be careful.

347
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,310
Lift your foot.

348
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,340
Be careful.

349
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,160
Yes, yes, yes.

350
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,820
Sleep here.

351
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,760
Go this way.

352
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,360
Lift him up a little higher.

353
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,240
A little higher. Go.

354
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,850
One, two, go.

355
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,130
Butler Su, be careful.

356
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,220
Thank you, guys.

357
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,350
You may leave now.

358
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,640
I'll take care of His Highness tonight.

359
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,120
Butler Su, Her Ladyship is here.

360
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,270
You don't need to bother with such a trivial matter.

361
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,070
You're right.

362
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,210
Help me up. Let's go.

363
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,810
Butler Su.

364
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,020
Shangguan.

365
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,170
We'll go back tomorrow.

366
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,910
We can make do with it tonight.

367
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,440
You sleep on the table.

368
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,200
No, Shangguan.

369
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,520
Can I sleep on the floor?

370
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,480
The table is small.

371
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,690
It's easy to fall from it if I turn over.

372
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,880
It's hard to turn over.

373
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,540
Shangguan.

374
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
Why did you get up suddenly?

375
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,890
Lie down.

376
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,540
One cup of wine.

377
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,650
Just one cup.

378
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,690
You are so drunk now.

379
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,190
You still insisted on drinking the wine.

380
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,100
You can't drink at all,

381
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,000
but you still forced yourself to drink.

382
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,210
Do you hate me?

383
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,780
No.

384
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,520
We got married under the imperial decree.

385
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,910
We have no feelings towards each other.

386
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,240
You don't like me at all.

387
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,930
That's what you told Madam Danchuan by yourself.

388
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,130
That was just the case at first, wasn't it?

389
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,490
We were indeed forced to get married at first.

390
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,430
What about now?

391
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,790
You said it yourself.

392
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,240
You asked me to behave myself these several days.

393
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,160
After you set up your own department,

394
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,290
you'll send me home.

395
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,910
You are my boss.

396
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,300
I am your employee.

397
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,690
No employee would like his boss.

398
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,770
You still hate me.

399
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,410
I never hate you.

400
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,720
If you don't,

401
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,570
can you

402
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,650
like me a little bit?

403
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,680
I... I'm not sure.

404
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,570
Morning.

405
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,060
How are you?

406
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,620
How was your rest?

407
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,060
You drank too much last night.

408
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,250
You don't remember?

409
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,300
I remember.

410
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,100
You remember?

411
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,830
Yes, I can't drink much,

412
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,800
but I can still act decently after getting drunk.

413
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,820
After Qi and Su Shen carried me back last night,

414
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,000
I fell asleep.

415
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,300
That's all?

416
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:20,960
That's all.

417
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,220
What else can there be?

418
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,970
Alright.

419
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,600
I'm going to wash up.

420
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,060
Get out.

421
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
You can do it while I'm here.

422
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,640
I won't be disturbed by you.

423
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
But I'll be disturbed by you.

424
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,890
Get out!

425
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,740
What?

426
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,100
What are you doing?

427
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,260
Did he kiss me or not?

428
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,490
Was it really a dream?

429
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,500
He must have kissed me.

430
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,350
I think you were dreaming.

431
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,810
How could it be a dream?

432
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,990
I remember all the details.

433
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,050
It can't be a dream.

434
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,080
You drank the wine too, right?

435
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,140
How can you be sure?

436
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,470
He did kiss me.

437
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,080
He definitely didn't.

438
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,580
He did.

439
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,600
He didn't.

440
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,430
He did kiss me.

441
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,470
Of course not.

442
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,630
He did kiss me.

443
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,390
That's impossible.

444
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,460
He clearly kissed me.

445
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,860
But I have no evidence.

446
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,570
Jing,

447
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,480
let me ask you something.

448
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,850
Forget it. I won't ask it.

449
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,870
Go ahead.

450
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,920
I have a younger sister.

451
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,730
She has a respected boss.

452
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,750
But recently she has found that her boss

453
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,750
looked at her

454
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,530
affectionately.

455
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,220
Most importantly,

456
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,920
she dreamed that

457
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,180
her boss did something improper to her.

458
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,000
You dreamed that Yin Zheng did something improper to you.

459
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,550
My sister, not me.

460
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,010
Alright.

461
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,280
If your sister

462
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,760
only had a dream,

463
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,850
there's no problem with it.

464
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,130
But it didn't seem like a dream.

465
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,930
So Yin Zheng really did something improper to you?

466
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,430
Not me. It's my sister.

467
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,640
Let's forget your sister first.

468
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,900
We can't forget her.

469
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:39,990
Okay.

470
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,570
Let me ask

471
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,050
whether your sister was reluctant or not.

472
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,820
If she was reluctant,

473
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,670
and that man still did something improper forcibly,

474
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,590
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

475
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,890
Put it down.

476
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,930
Calm down.

477
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,300
The scariest thing is that

478
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,280
she didn't seem reluctant.

479
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,480
If that's the case,

480
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,280
please ask your sister

481
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,340
to think about clearly

482
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,800
how she feels about her boss.

483
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,490
How should I face him

484
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,460
after we go back to Xinchuan?

485
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,560
Xinchuan is the head of the nine regions.

486
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,290
It manages all the affairs of the nine regions.

487
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,640
The cost is huge.

488
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,360
Therefore, it borrowed money from Jinchuan, a place

489
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,350
where all the money in the world is gathered.

490
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,680
It helped to put an end to the flood in Danchuan.

491
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,320
Though it was for the sake of the nine regions,

492
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,520
Xinchuan is short of money temporarily.

493
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,450
At the same time, Jinchuan urges us to repay the loan.

494
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,720
Xinchuan is in a dilemma.

495
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,020
What do you think, ministers?

496
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,500
Now Jinchuan wants us to repay the loan.

497
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,350
They're trying to give us a hard time deliberately.

498
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,530
We can't give in.

499
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,120
They are pressing us so intensely.

500
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,580
[Commander of the Ministry of War]

501
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,770
Let's fight.

502
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,180
Lord Commander, you sound so arrogant.

503
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,880
His Lordship's peaceful world which had been maintained with great efforts

504
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
was wiped out by a few words of yours.

505
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,030
Your Highness, do you mean to repay the loan?

506
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,280
The Ministry of Revenue has given the money to Danchuan to repair the roads.

507
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
We can't ask them to return it, can we?

508
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,120
Jinchuan clearly knows that something happened to Danchuan.

509
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,560
Even though they are selfish

510
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,990
and have refused to help,

511
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,700
they still force us to repay the loan under this circumstance.

512
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,440
They do it out of a malicious intention.

513
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,240
Shouldn't we fight back?

514
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,520
Please mind your words.

515
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,670
It's true that the repayment date we've promised to Jinchuan is coming.

516
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,450
Even if Jinchuan has a malicious intention,

517
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,600
with this news getting out, people will only think they're inconsiderate.

518
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,800
There is no reason for us to send troops.

519
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,680
That's right.

520
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,240
Our region governs the country with justice convincing the people.

521
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,720
We're not bullying people with power.

522
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,090
Yes.

523
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,280
Whichever region is in difficulty,

524
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,810
Xinchuan will surely help.

525
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,480
It is our bounden duty to help them with money.

526
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,210
But the greedy lord of Jinchuan

527
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,160
keeps an close eye on his own state treasury,

528
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,890
and never helps other regions.

529
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,880
When he received help from Xinchuan,

530
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,760
he would try to compete for the No.1 position.

531
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,080
In that case, if we don't teach him a lesson...

532
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,680
Everyone,

533
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,770
I want to hear your opinions.

534
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,350
Is there any department that can get the money back?

535
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,540
Honesty is much valued in our region.

536
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,080
Since we've promised Jinchuan,

537
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,310
even if we only repay part of the loan,

538
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
we should do our best.

539
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,070
The Legitimate Eldest Prince.

540
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,420
My Lord.

541
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,100
In my humble opinion,

542
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,160
if we need to raise money in a short time.

543
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,290
the only way is to levy taxes urgently,

544
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,160
but I'm afraid it might implicate the people.

545
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,880
I dare not make a decision.

546
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,120
Please give me some time.

547
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,890
I will definitely find a way

548
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,840
to share your burden.

549
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,320
Approved.

550
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,040
Dismiss.

551
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,910
Dismiss.

552
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,820
See you, My Lord.

553
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,320
We need to deal with Jinchuan in a short time,

554
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,440
and can't gain the money from the people.

555
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,640
It's not easy to come up with a solution.

556
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,110
An.

557
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,000
You're a relative of Lord Jinchuan's,

558
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,980
and you've always done business outside.

559
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,110
Do you have any idea?

560
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,360
My small business is far from being enough to satisfy Jinchuan.

561
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,520
Besides, I'm a very distant relative of his.

562
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,160
I'm not in the circles of his five generations.

563
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,930
I'm not sure whether Lord Jinchuan remembers me or not.

564
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,400
My wife is waiting for me at home.

565
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,440
I have to go.

566
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,640
Brother. Jun.

567
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,600
What a sly and changeable man he is.

568
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,280
If Jinchuan had not come to make things difficult for us,

569
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,040
and had come to make friends with us instead,

570
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,640
I'm afraid he would have rushed out and claimed to be his relative.

571
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,340
He just thinks it's a tricky problem,

572
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,020
and doesn't want to get involved.

573
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,730
Brother.

574
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,190
I heard that

575
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,840
Zheng had solved the problem in Danchuan.

576
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,800
We need to come up with a solution as soon as possible.

577
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,260
Otherwise, I'm afraid...

578
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,620
Do you mean that

579
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,250
a concubine's illegitimate son like him, who isn't much appreciated,

580
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,630
also deserves to be my opponent?

581
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,880
Of course he doesn't.

582
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,890
But he has been showing himself in front of our father recently.

583
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,750
I don't know what he's up to.

584
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,260
Well...

585
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,420
We have to be wary of his rising up.

586
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,710
Here we are.

587
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,280
Thank you, Butler Su.

588
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,210
You're welcome.

589
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,450
Come on, Shangguan.

590
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,220
Be careful.

591
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,510
Zheng.

592
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,370
I didn't expect you to end up like this today.

593
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,050
The same to you.

594
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,070
Shangguan.

595
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,810
Wait for me.

596
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,060
Your Highness.

597
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,130
Mr. Dai wants to see you.

598
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,200
Sir, what's so urgent that you want to see me in hurry?

599
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,050
Lord Jinchuan urged us to repay the loan.

600
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,070
However, the money acquired from taxes was distributed to Danchuan for flood relief.

601
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,330
Our state treasury is short of money now.

602
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,430
We are not able to repay the loan for the time being.

603
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,780
But if we don't repay the loan to Jinchuan,

604
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,870
I'm afraid it will damage our reputation.

605
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,830
His Lordship thinks so, too.

606
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
But I guess

607
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,600
His Lordship doesn't want to bring burden to the people.

608
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,620
It's not easy for the people.

609
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,350
Of course we can't think about using their money.

610
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,140
I remember you once said

611
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,760
there had been a bad debt during the reign of a former king.

612
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,000
This outside member came to the capital, and took money from the Ministry of Revenue,

613
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,840
even including the cost of local banquets,

614
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,030
but he never paid back.

615
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,830
But those are all old debts lent a long time ago.

616
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,910
After several dynasties,

617
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,790
no one successfully got back the loan.

618
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,040
Do you want to

619
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,530
give it a try?

620
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,680
But we must report this to His Lordship.

621
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,270
If we want to report it,

622
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,000
we have to come up with a perfect plan.

623
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,610
Don't worry, sir.

624
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,179
Put the weapons in my room.

625
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,469
Shangguan.

626
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,380
Listen to me.

627
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,260
Slow down.

628
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:18,850
Wait.

629
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,199
I thought about it.

630
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,690
I think your room is full.

631
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,040
It's not okay.

632
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,020
Just put these things in my study.

633
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,560
Are you willing to let me use your study?

634
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,239
What are you talking about?

635
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,639
Of course I'm willing to do so.

636
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,679
Mine is yours.

637
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,280
Besides,

638
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,969
I don't use this room usually.

639
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,310
Just put them inside.

640
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,889
Put them in the study.

641
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:39,480
Yes, yes, yes.

642
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:39,860
Come on.

643
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,610
This way.

644
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,449
How is it?

645
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,130
It's designed by me.

646
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,340
Is it like a peacock opening its tail?

647
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,030
Actually, my idea is simple.

648
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,280
Besides looking good, it must be practical.

649
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,400
From now on, if you want to fetch a weapon,

650
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,560
you don't have to search for it in the box.

651
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,500
Just look for it here.

652
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,360
You can see every weapon clearly.

653
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,660
What's wrong with Concubine Wei?

654
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,560
It seems she has been abnormal since she came back from Danchuan.

655
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,230
Your Ladyship,

656
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,230
it's almost time.

657
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Let's have lunch.

658
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,900
Have lunch?

659
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,760
I can't eat with him at the same table.

660
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,130
I'm not eating.

661
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,440
That's not okay.

662
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,000
His Highness went to work on the first day after he came back to the palace.

663
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,200
It's not easy for you to have a chance

664
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,370
to meet him during lunch time.

665
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,170
You have to go.

666
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,220
I suddenly have a stomachache.

667
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,090
I can't go.

668
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,480
You have a stomachache?

669
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,630
You have to go even if you have a stomachache.

670
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,350
Get up.

671
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,370
I really don't want to go.

672
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,050
I really don't want to go.

673
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,200
I'm not going.

674
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,270
My lady,

675
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,450
His Highness wants to see you.

676
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,630
There will be trouble in the palace next month.

677
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,760
You must be careful.

678
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
If someone asking for my help comes to see you,

679
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,000
you'd better not see him.

680
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,530
Nor can you accept the gift.

681
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,620
You want to see me

682
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,560
because you have to tell me about this, don't you?

683
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
Can there be another reason?

684
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,700
To deal with the affairs of the Ministry of Revenue,

685
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,070
you're afraid that some bad men might take advantage of loopholes,

686
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,690
so you want to take preventive measures. Right?

687
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,420
I'll ask a lot of people to repay debts next month.

688
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,590
It seems you've been avoiding me since we came back from Dancheon.

689
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,270
Really?

690
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,520
Li Wei.

691
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,140
If I did something that upset you,

692
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,050
please tell me directly.

693
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,510
No.

694
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,600
No.

695
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,920
You think too much.

696
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,250
Nothing happened.

697
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,360
Greetings, Your Highness and Your Ladyship.

698
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Madam He asked me to come here and see

699
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,970
whether Miss Song is sick.

700
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,360
Why hasn't she visited the Palace of Peace to greet Her Ladyship for days?

701
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,850
The black hair finally became gray hair.

702
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,840
It was still summer when my dear Zheng left me.

703
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,660
It's already autumn now.

704
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,830
Nine coins.

705
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:14,750
Mine.

706
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,420
I've got a good hand of cards but I played it badly.

707
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,680
Miss Song.

708
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,390
Miss Song.

709
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,570
His Highness is back.

710
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,400
He ordered me to release you.

711
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,440
It's been a month.

712
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,580
My dear Zheng finally remembered me.

713
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,530
He still cares about me.

714
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,410
I want to see him.

715
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,570
Miss Song.

716
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,620
Stay composed.

717
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,080
Now Concubine Wei is having dinner with His Highness.

718
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,620
It'll be awkward if you go.

719
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,390
Su.

720
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,160
You've just been back from Danchuan,

721
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,480
and you've also been bribed by that woman?

722
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,330
Not really.

723
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,100
I think Concubine Wei is really nice.

724
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,670
All of you are bullying me.

725
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,170
[Garden of Triumph]

726
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,850
[Chuan]

727
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,100
Your Highness is tired.

728
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,620
You do this.

729
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,290
Your handwriting is

730
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,930
a little better than me.

731
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,980
I belong to you anyway.

732
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,320
I'm lucky to achieve half of your

733
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,600
good style of calligraphy occasionally.

734
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,480
Even His Lordship praised your calligraphy.

735
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,500
You can write well as long as you relax.

736
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,880
Are you worried

737
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,170
about Jinchuan's problem?

738
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,590
As a woman,

739
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,610
you also know what's going on outside?

740
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,140
I heard it from others.

741
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,970
I didn't want you to worry.

742
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,300
That's why I wanted to help you relive your anxiety.

743
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,430
I'm not blaming you.

744
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,300
I'm just warning you.

745
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,660
Fangru used to meddle in the affairs outside a lot.

746
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,930
She showed too much of her ability and didn't know her place.

747
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,320
Her behavior didn't match the position as the wife of the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

748
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,130
I understand.

749
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,200
From now on, whatever I think and say

750
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,120
will be within your permission.

751
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,740
Actually, it's not a big deal to let you know.

752
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,480
I've already got an idea.

753
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,760
Do you know what Jinchuan lacks the most?

754
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,860
Jinchuan is the same as Xinchuan,

755
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,040
having no coal mine.

756
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,080
It can only rely on Daichuan.

757
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,700
Fangru's father

758
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,280
is the most famous mine owner in Daichuan.

759
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,520
If he agrees to deliver coal to Jinchuan,

760
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,700
we'll be able to pay off the debt we've owed to Xinchuan.

761
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,150
Your Highness, do you want to use the property of Her Ladyship's own family?

762
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,530
Her Ladyship and the Zhao Family won't agree.

763
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,710
She belongs to me.

764
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,410
The little property of her parents' family is nothing.

765
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,840
As long as the Zhao Family still wants to

766
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,500
continue doing coal business

767
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,910
with Xinchuan,

768
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,940
they won't complain about it.

769
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,590
At most, he might feel wronged.

770
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,680
I'll ask Jun to persuade him.

771
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,450
He knows how to comfort people.

772
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,820
Your Highness is wise.

773
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,400
Tomorrow morning in the imperial court session,

774
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,720
Your Highness should report this to His Lordship as soon as possible.

775
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,560
If His Lordship knows that you couldn't sleep at night for this matter,

776
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,040
he will be very happy.

777
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,690
Yes.

778
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,360
As long as I work hard to handle political affairs,

779
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,150
my father won't listen to the opinions of those concubines' sons.

780
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,400
What's wrong with you?

781
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,730
You're absent-minded.

782
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,640
I'm fine.

783
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,470
I just don't know how to get along with my boss.

784
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,890
Did you offend him again?

785
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,650
No.

786
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,550
Prince Zheng did something improper to her.

787
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,220
No.

788
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,060
Since he has forgotten it,

789
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,390
I should forget it, too.

790
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,360
♫The south wind meets the clouds♫

00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,030
