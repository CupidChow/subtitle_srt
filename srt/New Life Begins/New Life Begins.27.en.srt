Nine Regions Food Collection handed over these in the past few days.

6
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,710
The new currency has just been issued

7
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,039
and there are already so many counterfeit notes.

8
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,920
I can see

9
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,030
Brother Song doesn't want to get involved in this.

10
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,970
I want to ask Father to let you assist me.

11
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,060
If you can persuade Father to do so,

12
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,540
I'll do my best.

13
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:01,980
Deal.

14
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,400
Don't go back on your word.

15
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Okay.

16
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,640
I'm going to the palace now.

17
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,050
No need to see me off.

18
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,020
I knew Prince An came

19
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,400
to ask for your help with the investigation of the case.

20
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,030
I've persuaded you for so long.

21
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,940
I don't want you to get involved in this.

22
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,560
But Your Highness insists on it.

23
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,560
Even if you identify the source of the counterfeit notes,

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,760
you won't get the Ministry of Revenue anyway.

25
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,070
The reputation of finding out the truth

26
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,490
will just fall on Prince An.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,880
But you're the one who did it.

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,200
You might even be judged for overstepping authority.

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,160
The new currency is about people's livelihood.

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,320
I have to do it even if there is no benefit.

31
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,080
If everyone is after profit,

32
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,980
no one will go down in history,

33
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,840
except for the books of accounts.

34
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,270
On the fifth day of the first month,

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,970
Yin Zheng caught some counterfeit money dealers in the market.

36
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,920
At first, they refused to confess.

37
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,620
Tortured,

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,370
they all confessed.

39
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,030
On the eighth day of the month,

40
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,579
he and An raided two workshops

41
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,990
and arrested some plate makers.

42
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,680
On the ninth day,

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,530
the truth revealed itself.

44
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,310
They all said they knew a smuggler

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,660
called Chen Xi.

46
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,600
But after four days of investigation,

47
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,530
they've finally found the source.

48
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,860
We just need to catch Chen Xi now.

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,930
What's wrong with you?

50
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,090
Father.

51
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,060
Yin Zheng used severe punishment.

52
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,660
I heard that he used stoning on the plate dealers.

53
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,880
He told me about it.

54
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,480
He didn't use it.

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,200
He just buried them in the dirt and rocks

56
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,280
to scare them.

57
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,920
They were given water and food.

58
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,350
No one died.

59
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,790

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,650

62
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,390
Are you trying to teach me the laws of Xinchuan?

63
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,010
I wouldn't dare.

65
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,930
I'll leave it to Yin Zheng.

66
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,940
If you can't handle the affairs of the Ministry of Revenue,

67
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,580
you should go to the Ministry of Rites with Jun.

68

69
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,100
Go back and think about it.

we must catch Yin Zheng in the act.

74
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,130
This has already involved the Department of Penalty and Prisons.

75
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,110
You must keep a close eye on him at the Ministry of Rites.

76
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,710
Once any violation is found,

77
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,090
deal with it.

78
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,310

No news yet.

81
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,140
But Duke Yue said

82
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,880
perhaps we can use something else

83
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,480

I thought he'd make some big move.

107
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,280
But the Ministry of Rites just wrote a few letters of impeachment,

He can't impeach me for this.

Oh.

153

Tong'an Mountain is part of Xinchuan.

154
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,560
Daichuan crossed the border to fight over it.

155
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,620

But, My Lord,

172
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,970
the road closure will involve Danchuan.

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,560
We must not lose the Tong'an Mountain mine.

176
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,920
First, we'll block the official road to Daichuan

177

178
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,580

You don't know how to ride a horse.

189
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,360
What are you talking about?

190
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,480
I've taken riding lessons at least.

191
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I know how to do it.

192
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,090
Besides,

193
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,760
Father asked me to come with Zheng this time

194
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,890
so I can get trained.

195
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,340
Maybe when I return,

196
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,890
Father will assign me an official position.

197
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,470
Don't worry, he can ride.

198
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,830
But he's horse-sick.

199
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,740
If he rides long enough, he'll throw up.

200
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,760
He'll throw up the whole way.

201
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,220
The horses can get scared.

202
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,390
I'm going.

203
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,030
Be careful when you get on the horse.

204
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,520
Don't grip the horse's back too hard with your legs.

205
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,830
But hold on tight.

206
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,850
It's okay.

207
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,020
Don't worry too much.

208
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,950
I'm not worried.

209
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,980
We're going.

210
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,850
We're going.

211
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,320
Be careful.

212
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,670
Be careful on your way.

213
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,450
[Tong'an Post]

214
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,580
Good for me.

215
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,120
I am a genius with horses.

216
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,800
See how good it is on the way.

217
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,860
Shangguan can't laugh at me for this.

218
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
By the way, Zheng.

219
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
Aren't you helping An with the counterfeit money case recently?

220
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,120
Don't you think

221
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,160
it doesn't feel right

222
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,220
that Brother Song proposed to Father

223
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,610
and made you deal with this in Daichuan?

224
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,250
Even you can see that.

225
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,680
What do you mean, even I can see it?

226
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,910
Do I look stupid?

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,800
But it's good.

228
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,570
We can find out where Chen Xi is.

229
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,300
Luohe Town is next to Danchuan.

230
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,680
Please send a letter

231
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,340
and ask Lord Danchuan to send troops to guard it,

232
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,350
so that people of the two regions won't be affected.

233
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,840
Now we just need to close

234
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,690
the official road from Pingtong Town to Daichuan.

235
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,050
Understand?

236
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,160
Aren't you the lady from Daichuan?

237
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,530
[Chef of Harem Kitchen, Situ Jin]

238
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,960
Greetings, Princes.

239
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,010
Why did you

240
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,560
block off all the official roads in Luohe Town?

241
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,000
Tomorrow is the Luohe Town Tea and Horse Festival.

242
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,020
The northeastern towns of Danchuan

243
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,950
depend on it for livelihood.

244
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,560
Now the official roads are blocked,

245
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,420
I'm afraid it'll harm the livelihood of the people.

246
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,070
Where did you get the news?

247
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,800
An urgent order from the capital of Xinchuan.

248
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,250
Am I mistaken?

249
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,970
I thought

250
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,360
Father only asked for the closure of the official road in Daichuan.

251
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,490
Why are roads in Danchuan blocked too?

252
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,020
Could it be…

253
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,530
The top priority now

254
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,220
is to meet with Lord Danchuan.

255
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,650
I won't go.

256
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,450
I get nervous when I see her.

257
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,410
I thought you wanted to be trained.

258
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,970
Prince Qi, please.

259
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,920
Poor me.

260
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,290
Let's go.

261
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,370
Thank you.

262
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,090
Brother.

263
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,280
[The mountains towering high into the clouds]

264
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,230
The letter of road closure has been sent out.

265
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,170
What will Zheng do?

266
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,570
We made Father issue the road closure letter.

267
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,220
That's a dead end for him.

268
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,620
If he follows the rules,

269
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,730
he can't make it to return for instruction.

270
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,460
The impeachment papers are ready.

271
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,290
The moment we receive the news of Zheng taking a move,

272
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,230
we can…

273
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,410
Don't worry, Brother Song.

274
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,560
Well played.

275
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,870
This is a big win for you.

276
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,470
Although Daichuan has made a statement,

277
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,810
we can't lose the mine.

278
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,600
We still need to check the gates strictly

279
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,330
and prevent any Daichuan spies

280
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,680
from entering our territory.

281
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,210
Yes, sir.

282
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,770
Go ahead.

283
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,200
I'm exhausted.

284
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,220
You're in such a hurry.

285
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,160
Looks like things are settled.

286
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,010
What did Lord Danchuan say?

287
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,330
I didn't see her.

288
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,030
She's busy

289
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,090
pacifying some merchants.

290
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,200
But she knew how serious this is.

291
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,960
She issued an official letter right away,

292
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,890
clearly stating

293
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Danchuan will check the people passing by with Xinchuan,

294
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,530
in case of infiltration of Daichuan people into Tong'an Mountain.

295
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,220
What about Lord Daichuan?

296
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,960
He said that the Ministry of Rites had the wrong idea,

297
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,640
because Tong'an Mountain did

298
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,610
have something to do with Daichuan.

299
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,410
They're just finding an excuse.

300
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,890
They expect us

301
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,350
to take care of their charcoal business,

302
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,120
so they won't act rashly soon.

303
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,340
You know what?

304
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,970
During my trip to Danchuan,

305
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,720
I saw the merchants and people talking about it.

306
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,830
The Tea and Horse Festival seems to be a big deal.

307
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,790
Of course it is.

308
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,550
It's one of the most important festivals here.

309
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,569
The people of both places rely on it.

310
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,550
Is it too late

311
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,940
to send a letter to Father

312
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,380
and ask him to withdraw the order?

313
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
What should we do?

314
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,020
So I think…

315
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,569
Brother.

316
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,069
What do you think?

317
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,620
I think,

318
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,660
the general

319
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,560
doesn't have to do what he's told when he's away.

320
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,820
Why don't we open the official road first

321
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,260
before we apologize to Father?

322
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
What do you think?

323
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,700
Is this "Love me, love my dog"?

324
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,130
Zheng.

325
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,560
This is a matter of livelihood.

326
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,280
It's not what you said.

327
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,120
This is a big deal.

328
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,780
People's livelihood issues.

329
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,170
Brother.

330
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,210
You've grown up.

331
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,590
You've grown up.

332
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,130
You knew what to do.

333
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,490
You are just testing me.

334
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,330
You…

335
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,730
Here.

336
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Have a piece of cake.

337
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,060
Cool off.

338
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,000
It's sweet.

339
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,470
You mentioned

340
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,960
you'd come for Chen Xi.

341
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,600
Do we need to stay for a few more days?

342
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,560
I've sent someone to track him down.

343
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,900
Let's go back tomorrow

344
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,900
and give Father an explanation.

345
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,870
That's right.

346
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,720
Although you've made a deal with Daichuan,

347
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,650
we still have to explain to Father.

348
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,510
Prince Zheng has submitted a letter of apology.

349
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,200
He says he's giving Danchuan a free pass for the sake of the people's livelihood.

350
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,860
But he's ignoring the interests of Xinchuan.

351
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,620
It's an act of arbitrariness.

352
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,420
He should be punished severely.

353
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,450
That's right.

354
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,080
Prince Zheng is disobedient.

355
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,610
He has shaken the foundation of the Xinchuan.

356
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,620
That's right.

357
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,160
How can the Prince of Xinchuan be partial to the foreigners?

358
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,760
Well.

359
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,000
But Prince Zheng is also looking out for the people's livelihood.

360
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,590
It's justifiable but unforgivable.

361
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,160
Shangguan always says she wants to travel the world.

362
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,920
Look at this journey.

363
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,010
With my current horse-riding skills,

364
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm sure I won't hold her back.

365
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,050
How about

366
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,780
I go to the palace to see Father.

367
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,370
As you see it,

368
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,360
would Father object to giving Danchuan access

369
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,020
and protect the mine instead?

370
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,080
Let's do this.

371
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll go to the restaurant to see Shangguan.

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,260
-See you later. -Okay.

373
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,130
Let's go.

374
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,580
Han.

375
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,310
Qi.

376
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,810
What are you doing here?

377
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,280
I'm bringing some cubilose for Hao Jia to nourish her body.

378
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,880
This is it?

379
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,720
Let me see.

380
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,560
Does this work?

381
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
Of course it does.

382
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,830
It's not for you.

383
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,520
Why do you ask?

384
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,440
I'm just asking.

385
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
If this is good,

386
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,760
you can give me some.

387
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,890
Just a little.

388
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,690
I prepared it for Hao Jia.

389
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,560
Didn't you just come back from the border with Daichuan?

390
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,480
Why didn't you go to the palace first?

391
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,540
You've been coming to the restaurant too often lately.

392
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:17,970
What?

393
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,050
Have I?

394
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,240
Someone is here.

395
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,140
I can't see her if I don't come.

396
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,910
Who is it?

397
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,440
I mean.

398
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,530
You don't

399
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,040
still have feelings for Hao Jia, do you?

400
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,480
You can't let Shangguan down.

401
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,940
What are you talking about?

402
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,260
So

403
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,850
why do you always come here?

404
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,520
Don't tell me you're here to see Shangguan.

405
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,720
Everyone knows you two don't get along.

406
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,640
Fine.

407
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,100
See?

408
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,200
You told me not to let Shangguan Jing down.

409
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,360
And you said we don't get along.

410
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,560
So you have all the reasons.

411
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:45,890
Well,

412
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,870
think about it.

413
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,280
There are rumors in the palace

414
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,710
that you have something to do with Hao Jia's escaping.

415
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,200
Even if you don't like Shangguan,

416
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,800
it's still a fixed marriage.

417
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,290
You have to put away your feelings.

418
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,220
Who said…

419
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,200
Are you my big brother?

420
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,030
You're rattling on

421
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,320
nonstop.

422
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,080
That's enough.

423
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,720
Carry on your stuff.

424
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,580
I'm going back.

425
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,150
It's for your good.

426
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,660
Shangguan.

427
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,780
Shangguan.

428
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,860
Shangguan.

429
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,590
Shangguan.

430
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,210
Shangguan.

431
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:14,810
Prince Qi.

432
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,340
Lord Xinchuan asks to see you.

433
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,250
[Garden of Modesty]

434
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,820
Hao Jia.

435
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,770
This is for you.

436
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,500
I don't need it. I'm fine.

437
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,830
Can't you be gentler?

438
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,490
Hao Jia wouldn't be like this.

439
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,360
There are rumors in the palace

440
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
that you have something to do with Hao Jia's escaping.

441
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,880
Even if you don't like Shangguan,

442
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,250
it's still a fixed marriage.

443
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,180
You have to put away your feelings.

444
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,640
You can leave.

445
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,600
[Embrace sincerity and keep truth]

446
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,290
Are you in there?

447
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,930
I need to talk to you.

448
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,050
I heard

449
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,440
what you said to Han today.

450
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,040
I'm very concerned about it.

451
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,570
But I still want to make it clear to you.

452
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,470
Do you still

453
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,330
have feelings for Hao Jia?

454
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,220
I'm talking to you, Yin Qi.

455
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,770
Do you hear me?

456
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,540
Your Ladyship.

457
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,440
Your Ladyship.

458
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,040
Bad news!

459
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,410
Your Ladyship, bad news.

460
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,440
Prince Qi hasn't come back from the palace.

461
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,360
I asked about it.

462
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,080
And I heard

463
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,310
Prince Qi and Prince Zheng have been detained.

464
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,770
What?

465
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,230
This is from the Ministry of Rites,

466
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,450
accusing Prince Zheng of disobeying orders

467
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,760
and giving Danchuan a free pass without permission,

468
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
who has overstepped the authority.

469
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,920
This one

470
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,840
impeaches Prince Zheng for being uncaring

471
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,850
and disregarding Xinchuan.

472
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,800
The Ministry of Revenue impeaches Prince Zheng

473
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,170
for fawning over Lord Danchuan

474
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,180
and disregarding the mine.

475
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,770
The officer of six departments impeaches Prince Zheng for disobedience,

476
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,070
nonobservance of the custom,

477
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,730
and acting before reporting.

478
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,110
I didn't even know

479
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,810
you've gotten so bold.

480
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,690
I dare not.

481
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,200
Road closure is a matter of livelihood.

482
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,830
Time was of the essence.

483
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,440
That's why I had the audacity…

484
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,900
You had the audacity to go against the grain.

485
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,900
Zheng.

486
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,680
I've read all your letters of apology.

487
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,880
I won't believe

488
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,380
you did this on your own.

489
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,620
Did Qi, the son-in-law of Danchuan, know nothing about it?

490
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,650
Indeed, he didn't know about it.

491
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,440
He's aloof and doesn't care much about things.

492
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,240
You know that.

493
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:43,880
Father.

494
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,530
I also think

495
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,840
Qi couldn't decide on this.

496
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Everyone knows

497
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,870
that Zheng is in charge of this.

498
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,320
He dared to make a decision without asking Father.

499
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,690
Did he think

500
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,250
he knew how to make decisions better than My Lord?

501
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,270
Prince Song, you don't have to make it bigger.

502
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,500
My Lord.

503
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,390
Lord Danchuan has agreed to tighten the checkpoints

504
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,590
and won't let any spies enter Xinchuan.

505
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,600
Zheng.

506
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,160
Have you ever thought

507
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,170
why I'd close the official road

508
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,470
before the Tea and Horse Festival?

509
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,570
The festival is a mixed bag in Luohe Town.

510
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,180
If Daichuan takes the chance

511
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,700
and sends a spy

512
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,640
who sneaks into Tong'an Mountain via Danchuan

513
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,350
and poses danger to the mine,

514
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,360
what will you do?

515
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,890
You must have thought of that too.

516
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,640
Are you headstrong and self-willed?

517
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,400
Or are you disobeying orders?

518
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,480
-Daichuan has already made its position clear. -Zheng should have been working with Lord Daichuan.

519
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,120
That's what the Nine Regions Affairs Division should be doing.

520
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,240
But now Zheng has failed in his duties.

521
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,180
I had no choice

522
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,360
but to negotiate with Daichuan myself.

523
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,720
You negotiated with Daichuan?

524
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,850
When did you negotiate with Daichuan?

525
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,760
My father-in-law is the owner of the Daichuan mine.

526
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,300
He has joined forces with other mine owners

527
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,560
to persuade Daichuan to give up the Tong'an Mountain mine.

528
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,140
And now it's done.

529
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Here is the reply.

530
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,920
It seems that Lord Daichuan has already figured it out.

531
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Tong'an Mountain is our territory.

532
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,690
They shouldn't covet it.

533
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,730
Zheng.

534
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,440
You are the Prince of Xinchuan,

535
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,640
not that of Danchuan.

536
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,830
Father sent you to Tong'an Mountain this time,

537
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,770
so that you could keep the mine

538
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,490
and mediate with Daichuan.

539
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,010
But what you did was the same as disobeying the order.

540
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,530
But the good thing is

541
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,150
we're all family.

542
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,760
After you submitted the letter of apology,

543
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,160
we can make a big deal of it

544
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,580
but be lenient.

545
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,110
Zheng.

546
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,700
Do you recognize your crime?

547
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,620
With the crime of transgression,

548
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,300
you should be dismissed and investigated.

549
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,700
Your crime shall be dealt with separately.

550
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,180
From tomorrow,

551
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,520
you don't have to go to the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

552
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,460
Father.

553
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,480
No, Father!

554
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Zheng did negotiate with Daichuan many times.

555
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,720
And he is going to be dismissed twice.

556
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,300
What will the people think of Prince Zheng?

557
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:37,810
Father.

558
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,590
Please look into it, Father.

559
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,470
In fact,

560
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,740
the one who removed the ban from Danchuan road

561
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,300
was me.

562
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,000
What does this have to do with you?

563
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,590
I'm the son-in-law of Lord Danchuan.

564
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,680
I was anxious to protect my relative,

565
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,880
so I decided on my own.

566
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,640
Zheng didn't know about it.

567
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,080
Father.

568
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,700
Qi.

569
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,540
You need to find a good excuse

570
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,760
before you lie.

571
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,320
You went to Tong'an Mountain together.

572
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,350
You took orders from him.

573
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,480
How could you decide

574
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,400
without his orders?

575
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,260
Why couldn't I?

576
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,370
I'd let people go without the order to open the road in Danchuan.

577
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,840
Would I be afraid of Zheng's disapproval?

578
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,300
Father.

579
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,920
This has nothing to do with Qi.

580
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,380
Father.

581
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,130
This is my fault.

582
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,360
You should punish me.

583
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,820
Father.

584
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,260
Zheng knew nothing, Father.

585
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,120
That's enough.

586
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,510
Someone come!

587
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:26,980
Yes.

588
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,790
Take Prince Qi and Prince Zheng out of here.

589
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,170
20 strokes for each.

590
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,890
And put him in a cell.

591
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,490
Yes.

592
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,430
Father.

593
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,520
You should punish me.

594
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,720
Zheng didn't know anything.

595
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,180
Father!

596
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,280
Father, Zheng really didn't know.

597
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,440
Father!

598
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,690
Father!

599
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,360
Nanny.

600
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,940
How is it?

601
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:07,820
My lady.

602
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,240
The Lord is furious.

603
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,880
He even said

604
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,960
he'd abolish Prince Zheng's dignity.

605
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,580
And he beat the two Princes up.

606
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,190
[Nanny Fu, Attendant of Madam Chun]

607
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,290
He's always been foolish.

608
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,850
Lord Xinchuan doesn't expect much from him.

609
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,270
But this is the first time he's been hit so hard.

610
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:22,760
I can't wait.

611
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,280
I have to ask my sister to write to Lord Xinchuan.

612
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,870
My Lady.

613
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,690
I don't know much.

614
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,350
But I can see.

615
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,000
I think

616
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,940
it's better

617
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,910
to let the Lord vent his anger.

618
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,290
We are not in a hurry.

619
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,480
But I'm afraid he'll act like a child

620
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,520
and won't admit his mistake.

621
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,150
My Lady.

622
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,830
Don't worry about it.

623
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,820
In my opinion,

624
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,750
it's a good thing that he's been beaten.

625
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,330
It means

626
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,600
the Lord is venting his anger.

627
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,130
If he didn't even let it out,

628
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,990
that means he's really disappointed.

629
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,350
It's getting late.

630
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,240
You'd better go home early and rest.

631
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,320
Look, you've got dark shadows under your eyes.

632
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,030
Go home.

633
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,490
I don't understand.

634
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,500
They obviously did a good deed.

635
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,860
How can they be used and accused?

636
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,870
I heard

637
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,970
that Prince Qi had proved himself innocent.

638
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,730
But when he heard that the Lord wanted to punish Prince Zheng,

639
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,390
Prince Qi rushed to

640
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,060
take all the blame.

641
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,250
I don't what will happen later.

642
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,370
Shangguan.

643
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,680
Go home and write a letter to Lord Danchuan.

644
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,930
Tell her not to plead for mercy.

645
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,780
It's taboo to overstep.

646
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,830
If you ask for help from another country,

647
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,490
people won't let it go easily.

648
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,370
It's better to find out what's going on first.

649
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,790
There is no definite answer.

650
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,500
If we speculate randomly,

651
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,480
it'll do no good.

652
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,770
Don't worry.

653
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,020
Yuan Ying and I will try to go to the palace

654
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,220
and ask Madam He and Madam Chun for help.

655
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,760
Thank you.

656
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,930
It'll be fine.

657
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
Prince Zheng.

658
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,390
The Lord didn't want to lock you up.

659
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,570
Now that you've been released,

660
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,290
as long as you apologize,

661
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,560
it will be over.

662
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,430
What's

663
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,030
the Lord's decision?

664
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,360
Prince Qi will have to take the punishment.

665
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,580
Prince Zheng.

666
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,470
You must protect yourself.

667
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,890
Greetings, My Lord.

668
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,520
Do you recognize your fault?

669
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,280
I've overstepped the rules

670
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,920
and acted before reporting.

671
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,380
I should be dealt with according to the law.

672
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,990
I have no complaints

673
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,530
if My Lord wishes to dismiss me.

674
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,530
But Father, can you let Qi go?

675
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,010
He has nothing to do with this.

676
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,960
You admit your guilt.

677
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,060
But you don't think you're wrong.

678
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,910
Do you think you're a man of honor?

679
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,060
And you want to protect Qi.

680
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,930
I know if he knew about it.

681
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,670
Is this the time for you to show brotherhood?

682
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
Qi couldn't make decisions.

683
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,900
All decisions are made by me alone.

684
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,120
I was the one who let people go.

685
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,960
I should be the one to be punished too.

686
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,760
Why did you let Qi take the blame?

687
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,860
Is it because…

688
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,480
Because I'm more valuable than him?

689
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,219
Shut up!

690
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,360
Is that how you think of your father?

691
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,330
I've treated you well!

692
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,420
Do you know that in just half a day,

693
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,570
the impeachment papers

694
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,670
have been sent to the palace like snowflakes?

695
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,290
Qi has admitted

696
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,969
he did it.

697
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,699
He is also Danchuan's son-in-law.

698
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,870
Who would believe

699
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,429
he had nothing to do with it?

700
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,100
But I'm the one

701
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,699
who disobeyed.

702
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,290
Not him.

703
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,430
Are you

704
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,450
forcing me?

705
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,680
[Garden of Perseverance, Mansion of the Fourth Prince]

706
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,460
You've lost again, Jun.

707
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,620
You're probably going to

708
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,450
take my next month's salary too.

709
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,760
I'll give you a chance

710
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,960
to let you win back all your previous salary.

711
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,350
What do you want to bet on this time?

712
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,000
Let's bet on Zheng.

713
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,960
Let's see how long he can survive.

714
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,200
Prince Zheng.

715
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,630
I don't know what to say.

716
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,490
Can the Lord

717
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,030
go easy on Qi?

718
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,550
I don't dare to speculate

719
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,040
how the Lord thinks.

720
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,850
The Lord only asked me

721
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,610
to take you to the side hall for self-reflection.

722
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,600
Please

723
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,450
give a message to the Lord.

724
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,650
The jade can be made into a weapon.

725
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,210
But taking the children as a weapon,

726
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,370
not as a human being,

727
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,940
will generate grudge

728
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,880
and lead to abandonment.

729
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:38,750
My Lord.

730
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,130
Prince Zheng shouldn't say such things.

731
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,690
The Lord wants to use him to provoke Prince Song.

732
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,530
That's the duty of a brother.

733
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,740
He's

734
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,200
just worried about Prince Qi

735
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,750
and has lost his mind.

736
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,110
He knew

737
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,170
I'm using him to hold Prince Qi at bay.

738
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,050
He volunteered to be my sword.

739
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,130
And now he said

740
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,310
if I treat my sons as tools,

741
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,390
my sons will abandon me too sooner or later.

742
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,300
My Lord.

743
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,440
Prince Zheng just…

744
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,050
Enough.

745
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,730
He's being impulsive.

746
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,800
He can't even follow the etiquette

747
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,290
for brotherhood.

748
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:28,870
Yes.

749
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,630
My Lord.

750
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,360
What will you do to Prince Qi?

751
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,570
The Ministry of Rites has sent many impeachment reports.

752
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,100
I have to give an explanation after all.

753
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,760
Zheng can't afford

754
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
the crime of transgression.

755
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,400
But Qi...

756
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,090
Shangguan.

757
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,870
Shangguan.

758
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,870
What are you doing here?

759
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,340
Shangguan.

760
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,770
Me and my husband

761
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,060
both live under the wing of Prince Song.

762
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,160
Prince Song asked us to deliver a message.

763
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,360
We can't refuse that.

764
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,270
But my husband is a man.

765
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,710
He can't come to the door.

766
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,410
I have to come and tell you.

767
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,720
Go ahead.

768
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,860
Qi's life is in danger.

769
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,210
His life?

770
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,480
How can his life be in danger?

771
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,090
I thought

772
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,850
he's only in jail temporarily.

773
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,050
Qi committed a capital crime this time.

774
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,360
I don't know how this happened.

775
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,880
It's obviously Prince Zheng's fault.

776
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,350
But now he's fine.

777
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,390
And Qi's in great danger.

778
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,870
Shangguan.

779
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,470
Prince Song can't let this happen.

780
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,310
Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent us to deliver the message.

781
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:06,920
He thought

782
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,840
you are the princess of Danchuan after all.

783
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,040
Do something about it.

784
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,240
Maybe Qi can still have a chance to live.

785
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,390
Well...

786
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,440
The Lord wants to kill Yin Qi.

787
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,160
[Mother of the Fifth Prince, Madam Chun]

788
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,630
You sent letters to the palace asking to see the Lord.

789
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,160
But they were all returned.

790
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:44,450
The Lord must haven't decided what to do.

791
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,450
Now that you've been let in,

792
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,840
I think he has a decision.

793
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,700
In the daytime,

794
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,600
Zheng has been brought out.

795
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,140
He is now being held in the side hall.

796
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,860
But there is no news of Qi

797
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,860
in the prison.

798
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,750
Any news from Lord Danchuan?

799
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Shangguan has asked Lord Danchuan.

800
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,500
There's nothing wrong with what they're doing.

801
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,230
It's to maintain peace between the two regions.

802
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,300
Yin Zheng and Yin Qi

803
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,960
had made a deal with Daichuan.

804
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,050
But Prince Song beat them

805
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,810
to expose it.

806
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,500
Prince Song's wife didn't even know about it

807
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,230
and didn't have time to tell us.

808
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,880
And now we're in this situation.

809
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,730
It's not a clever trap.

810
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,070
But it is effective.

811
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,280
Someone has to take the charge

812
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,010
of disobedience and trespass.

813
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,100
It is

814
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,440
an offence carrying a life sentence.

815
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,050
The Lord cannot afford to lose two sons at the same time.

816
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,890
I'm afraid he has already

817
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,940
weighed his options now.

818
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,340
Sister.

819
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,450
I'll go to see the Lord.

820
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,920
You don't have to go for now.

821
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,380
I'll go.

822
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,000
He is not the only one who can make decisions

823
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,700
in this world.

824
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,390
Bad news!

825
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,340
Lady Shangguan is breaking into the prison!

826
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:45,540

827
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,760
