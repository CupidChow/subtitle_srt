This is my file.

192
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,780
What is this?

193
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,840
This is the perfume I made with orange peel and osmanthus.

194
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,930
This is the liquid rouge made of rose juice.

195
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,610
Am I not allowed to bring them into the palace?

196
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,570
Then please keep them, nannies.

197
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,160
This is the book Commandments for Women that I always carry with me.

198

Can I bring this into the palace?

199

It's fine.

It's me.

213

More than five years.

You're still as beautiful and lovely as when you were little.

215

You're pretty and lovely too.

216
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,920
Don't be afraid

217
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,760
if something like this happens again in the future.

218
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,380
I'm here.

I'll protect you.

look a little bit strict,

222
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
but they won't do anything to us.

223
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,570
Besides, they just confiscated some food from you.

224
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,050
They'll distribute food in the palace later.

225
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,650
It's okay.

226
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,250
They didn't take all of it.

227
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,420
Oh my god, there's still some left.

228
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,330

She is a top beauty among all the beauties.

She's at least a nine for me.

[The Seventh Prince, Yin Yan]

238
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,560
As for the one point deducted,

239
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,240
it's because I heard that she's overly elegant and arrogant.

240
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,370
It's really boring.

241
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,860
Where did you get the portrait?

242
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,260
This girl

243
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,850
is not even as pretty as me.

But I heard

she's a weirdo who came in a donkey carriage.

249
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,550

named Hao Jia from Yanchuan.

254
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,040
She never cares about the trivia in the outside world,

255
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,490
and only reads books of female virtue.

256
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,690
She's of top quality.

Well,

259

you've gone too far rating people like this.

260
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,710
It's just a portrait.

261
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,340
So exaggerated...

262
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
This is indeed...

263
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,600
This one is good.

264
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,500
What's her name again?

It's not Commandments for Women.

But the Eighth Prince died young.

So there are ten princes left.

The older four princes

have already got their legal wives.

After the court meeting,

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,080
they began living outside the palace in their own mansions.

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,660
It's not appropriate.

They are innocent girls,

306
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,100

307
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,850
Fine.

308
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,120
Others can judge me,

309

but you're not even getting married.

310
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,850

But she's from Danchuan,

318
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,130
so I'm thinking, one point.

319
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,610
What's wrong with Danchuan?

320
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,980

322
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,600
So ridiculous.

Naturally,

it's hard for local girls to get married there.

325
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,720

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,320
Your Highness, you are about to be 20,

379
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,810
yet Lord hasn't allowed you to meet him on court yet.

380
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,210
In my opinion,

381
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,770
you should watch for the proper moment for action.

382
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,120
My illegitimate elder brother stationed in Mochuan.

383
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,570
Now all the land outside belongs to my legitimate eldest brother.

384
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,680
Although Father loves and indulges my third brother,

385
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,210
he still needs to bow to him.

386
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,280
My fourth brother also follows his leadership.

387
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,400
That's why he managed to open his mansion and go to court meetings.

388
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,370
But he only got a leisure job at the Ministry of Rites.

389
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,270
If I don't want to an idler,

390
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,270
[The Sixth Prince, Yin Zheng]

391
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,569
I'm afraid I'll have to act servilely.

392
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,420
Prince Qi is naughty and neglected his studies.

393
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,700
Lord hasn't allowed him to attend the court meeting.

394
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,380
It won't be easy for you

395
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,329
to surpass your elder brother.

396
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,940
But you got the first place

397
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,990
in all the exams this year.

398
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,260
I think

399
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,670
Lord should have noticed that.

400
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,560
I have nine brothers,

401
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
but Father only has two eyes.

402
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,800
To get his attention and get a good position in the imperial court,

403
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,610
I have to plan carefully.

404
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,850
Lord may overlook you

405
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,630
in the selection this year.

406
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
It's boring to climb the throne by marriage.

407
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,800
I can earn

408
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,270
what I want by myself.

409
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,810
Thank you for letting me win.

410
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,790
I know

411
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,770
you are quite ambitious.

412
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,480
But you should find

413
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,350
a wife from a reliable family.

414
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,330
Danchuan and Mochuan have powerful armies.

415
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,660
Jinchuan is rich.

416
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,500
Daichuan has mines.

417
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,630
But Jichuan.

418
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,170
It has nothing

419
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,740
but good feng shui.

420
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,770
Then it's not bad

421
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,920
if I get a girl from Jichuan.

422
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,850
I can get

423
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,030
good feng shui for my burial.

424
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,050
If we scheme too much on our marriages,

425
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,120
I'm afraid Father will be annoyed.

426
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,460
The scheme should be appropriate.

427
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,290
If too much,

428
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,420
it may backfire.

429
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,050
Since you chose me,

430
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,410
please believe that

431
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,030
I won't let you down.

432
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,490
[Zhongyi Hall]

433
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,550
The selection begins.

434
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,650
Princess Shangguan, please come forward.

435
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,440
[Madam Xinchuan  Lord Xinchuan]

436
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,740
How is your family background?

437
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
You've already called me Princess.

438
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,260
Don't you know what my family background is like?

439
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,940
[Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs  Head Nanny]

440
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,790
Greetings, My Lord, My Lady.

441
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,460
I'm Hao Jia from Yanchuan.

442
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,050
My parents are still alive.

443
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,470
My father and brother both work for the imperial court,

444
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,200
and my sisters are all married to noble families.

445
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,570
Li Wei from Jichuan.

446
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,450
Did your family hire a etiquette teacher for you?

447
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,400
My family has been farmers for three generations.

448
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
Only my father passed the exam,

449
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,490
but his post was too insignificant to get into the palace.

450
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,770
I come from an ordinary family.

451
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,630
We have nothing but a small field.

452
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,760
My Lady.

453
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,340
What did you ask

454
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,910
just now?

455
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,870
Did you read any books back at home?

456
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,870
Book of Tactics.

457
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,440
It's a book for men, right?

458
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,790
I never knew

459
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,190
books are gendered.

460
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,100
I think a lady should study

461
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,810
to serve her husband better.

462
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
We're not marrying an ordinary man,

463
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
but the distinguished prince of Xinchuan.

464
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,040
So, the external affairs can't be avoided.

465
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,960
For example, people's livelihood and political history.

466
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
Women shouldn't read about these.

467
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,160
As for internal affairs,

468
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,280
such as the prince's daily affairs,

469
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,160
education of children,

470
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,120
the relationship between different levels

471
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,520
and accounts in the mansion.

472
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,200
I've read about all these

473
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,960
back at home.

474
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,760
I won't let you down.

475
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
The Classics and Rites,

476
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
and needlework

477
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,120
are things I don't know well about.

478
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,440
But I'm good at tasting good food.

479
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,430
I want to ask

480
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,680
what other rules have you learned

481
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,480
about serving your husband?

482
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,330
In fact, in Jichuan,

483
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,940
we subscribe to monogamy.

484
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,580
We won't use the word "serve".

485
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,400
If two people love each other,

486
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,240
they will go to the God of Matchmaking Temple to make a vow

487
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,050
and then register in the county government.

488
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,830
If anyone

489
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,790
breaks the vow between husband and wife,

490
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,720
the villagers will criticize him.

491
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,980
Then what's your plan

492
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,220
for the future?

493
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,600
If it can go as I wish,

494
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,790
I would like to travel around the nine regions

495
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,170
and help the ones in need.

496
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,460
I hope in the future,

497
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,410
I can see my husband smile every day.

498
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,330
I haven't thought that much

499
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,130
about the future.

500
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,160
The backyard will be beautiful and peaceful.

501
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,770
We'll have three children.

502
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,640
When we grow old,

503
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,730
we can go to the backyard

504
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,380
and enjoy sunlight together.

505
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
But as a princess,

506
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,970
I indeed shoulder more responsibilities.

507
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,770
I can only practice my spear well

508
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,820
and protect the people I should protect.

509
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,660
But I think

510
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,560
the future

511
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,560
is composed of every day from now on.

512
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,980
The two people should respect,

513
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,370
understand, and tolerate each other,

514
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,690
and live every day to its best.

515
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,890
Not missing one single meal

516
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,150
is the most important.

517
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
You may leave now.

518
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,080
All candidates, please wait outside the palace

519
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,190
for good news.

520
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,090
[Head eunuch, Liang Shi]

521
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,350
The kid from Jichuan is inappropriate.

522
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,940
I like Hao Jia quite a lot.

523
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,140
Qi told me about her too.

524
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,670
Qi is incompetent.

525
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,640
If she can be his wife,

526
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,620
he may become more mature.

527
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,000
I didn't expect their questions.

528
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,370
Do you think

529
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,470
I'll be chosen by them?

530
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,770
Given your answers,

531
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,370
you will definitely realize your dream

532
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,570
and not get selected.

533
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,540
I'm relieved then.

534
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,020
Wei,

535
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,910
can you find a way to go to the Prince Mansion over there?

536
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Why?

537
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,200
Didn't you say you didn't have much for lunch?

538
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
The kitchen of the Prince Mansion

539
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,770
cooks great dishes.

540
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,210
Don't try to fool me.

541
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,640
Tell me, what do you want?

542
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,930
I'm not lying.

543
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,040
I lingered for a while just now and

544
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,640
heard Lord Xinchuan say that

545
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,230
he wants me to marry Yin Qi.

546
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,500
I don't want to.

547
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,980
The one I want to marry is Yin Song.

548
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,910
Who is Yin Qi?

549
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,010
And who is Yin Song?

550
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,200
Why can't you tell them apart?

551
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,440
Lord has ten sons.

552
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,850
How can I recognize every one of them?

553
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,780
Yin Qi is the Fifth Prince.

554
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,360
Yin Song is the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

555
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,090
Yin Song is the legitimate one?

556
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,900
Then if you marry him, you can only be his concubine.

557
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,480
I know.

558
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,290
My mother said

559
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,310
women can only make a living in the imperial harem.

560
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,440
The imperial harem

561
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,690
is the career of women for a lifetime.

562
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,630
It's nothing different from running a shop.

563
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,230
The husband is the boss.

564
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,630
His wife

565
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,810
is just a troublesome steward.

566
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,560
Since I'm here to work,

567
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,190
I'll choose the best region, Xinchuan.

568
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,080
Since I'm already in Xinchuan,

569
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,530
I have to find a boss with the best prospects.

570
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,850
Isn't that the Legitimate Eldest Prince?

571
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,310
You can't think like that.

572
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,240
You are a great girl.

573
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,300
You should find someone who loves you and protects you.

574
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,240
Wei.

575
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,850
I'm not like you.

576
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,910
Your father only has your mother.

577
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,850
Of course you have expectations for marriage.

578
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,570
But I...

579
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,620
My father is not a good boss.

580
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,400
My mother has been his concubine forever.

581
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,440
But just because of the words of his legal wife,

582
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,740
I was regarded as the legitimate daughter

583
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,200
and was sent out for peace-making marriage.

584
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,460
I have no one to rely on.

585
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,070
So I have to plan

586
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,930
for my own future.

587
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,540
Is the food from the Prince Mansion

588
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,540
really delicious?

589
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,830
Let's go.

590
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,470
Can this work?

591
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,770
It must.

592
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,130
They are coming.

593
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,830
We meet again.

594
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,700
You...

595
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,970
It's not easy to deliver food at noon.

596
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,830
Let me help you.

597
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,560
Who are you?

598
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,760
I'm Wei from Prince Zheng's palace.

599
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,640
Have you forgotten?

600
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,860
We met a few days ago.

601
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,400
You're so forgetful.

602
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,330
What do we have for lunch today?

603
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,020
Potatoes and sweet potatoes

604
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,300
can't be put together.

605
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,820
Potatoes prefer lower temperatures,

606
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,130
while sweet potatoes like it warm.

607
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,800
If put together,

608
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,160
either the potatoes will sprout,

609
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,800
or the sweet potatoes will turn bad from inside.

610
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,850
I can tell you rarely go into the kitchen.

611
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,960
Let me tell you.

612
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:38,790
You...

613
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,840
We are together.

614
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,480
Raw food and cooked food

615
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,310
shouldn't be put together either.

616
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,230
They will taint the taste of each other.

617
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,260
If the taste is tainted,

618
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
just separate...

619
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,200
After the selection,

620
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,910
you will get married.

621
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,440
Father also said he wanted you to open the mansion and attend court meetings.

622
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,640
But you've been fooling around all day.

623
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,860
The articles you submitted are always full of wrongly written characters.

624
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,060
Even I can't stand it.

625
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,200
The Ministry of Rites assesses the princes that attend court meetings every month.

626
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,000
They won't let you save face.

627
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:10,890
Brother.

628
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,290
What did they say about you this month?

629
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,840
They used the words from Inspection of Mice.

630
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,950
"Mice have skin,

631
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,800
but men may have no manners."

632
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,530
The next line of this poem is "A man without manners may as well die."

633
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,440
The position I gave your fourth brother

634
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,600
is the supervisor of the Ministry of Rites,

635
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,850
which is their superior.

636
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,290
They even dared to impeach your fourth brother.

637
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,870
Think about it yourself.

638
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,640
The Ministry of Rites wouldn't scold you anyway.

639
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,640
Of course it's easy for you to say...

640
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,790
If you have a problem with me,

641
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,790
you can write a memorial to impeach me.

642
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,520
But don't write a memorial

643
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,320
full of wrongly written characters

644
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,650
to embarrass Xinchuan.

645
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,420
Qi.

646
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,280
Apologize to Legitimate Eldest Prince.

647
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,760
Do you still want to open your mansion

648
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,680
or not?

649
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,390
I just don't understand.

650
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,970
There are so many brothers who are incompetent.

651
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,630
Why do I have to be the one who's getting scolded?

652
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,060
What are you doing?

653
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,280
I'm sorry

654
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,560
for disturbing.

655
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,230
Zheng

656
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,090
solved my game of Go.

657
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,660
What do you know about Go, Zheng?

658
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,340
Stop teaching a fish how to swim.

659
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,810
That's right.

660
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,610
What do you know about Go, Zheng?

661
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,560
Song has left the final phase here for days.

662
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,370
No one could solve it,

663
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,300
but you did?

664
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,870
If you're interested in learning Go,

665
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,440
why don't we have another match?

666
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,970
My stomach...

667
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,580
Are you okay?

668
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
You sicko.

669
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,680
Why are you pretending

670
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,200
to be a crazy about Go?

671
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,070
You have a stomachache again, right?

672
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,470
You...

673
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,830
Brother.

674
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,280
You know that Zheng hasn't been in good shape.

675
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,320
Go back first.

676
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,480
Thank you.

677
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,960
Qi.

678
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,760
Take me home.

679
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,880
I'll see him off.

680
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,890
Why did you get involved in this mess?

681
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,310
You solved his game of Go.

682
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,570
Don't you know he's...

683
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,480
Zheng.

684
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,840
What I just said was

685
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,100
"I'll see you off", right?

686
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:38,820
Go.

687
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,770
I'll see you off.

688
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,610
Go back and take some medicine.

689
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,160
Brother.

690
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,810
You were right just now.

691
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,870
I know I was wrong.

692
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,490
How about this?

693
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,420
I'll collect the fishing rod for you.

694
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,480
I'll go get the rod.

695
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,580
Let me do it.

696
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,010
Miss.

697
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,050
Where are you going?

698
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,840
I'm Hao Jia, the candidate from Yanchuan.

699
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,940
I got lost.

700
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,590
Please show me the way back, Your Highness.

701
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,940
It's over there.

702
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,840
Just go this way.

703
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,250
You'll pass by a willow tree.

704
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,250
Then turn right and walk to the end.

705
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,550
Then turn right after you pass the gate.

706
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,850
You'll arrive at Zhongyi Hall.

707
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,400
Thank you, Prince Qi.

708
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,910
How do you know I'm Prince Qi?

709
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,050
No one else can be so silly as you.

710
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,540
I was just guessing.

711
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,220
Seems that I guessed it right.

712
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,260
Amazing.

713
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,450
Yes.

714
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,400
Let's go.

715
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,680
I'll take you there.

716
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,970
Come on. Be careful.

717
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,260
Here.

718
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,420
This game is interesting.

719
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,760
The one who solved this game is of average intelligence.

720
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,710
It seems that he found it out by luck.

721
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,040
But the one who set the game

722
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,860
is good at the strategy of nudging and blocking,

723
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,970
which made black unable to expand.

724
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,800
It seems that the offensive side

725
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,660
is resourceful

726
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,260
and extraordinarily wise.

727
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,350
Black played better.

728
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,330
But I'm sorry.

729
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,050
You're not the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

730
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,720
Sorry. I thought I was smart and talked too much.

731
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,650
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

732
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,820
Never mind.

733
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,610
You were right.

734
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,180
The Legitimate Eldest Prince won't blame you.

735
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,730
Greetings, Your Highness.

736
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,970
I have some preserved almonds with me.

737
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,240
I made them myself.

738
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,600
Take it as a gift for your kind guidance.

739
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,800
It's nothing valuable.

740
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,130
Please don't mind.

741
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,810
Okay.

742
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,850
Great.

743
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,830
Your Highness.

744
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,910
I didn't bring enough preserved almonds.

745
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,790
If I can see you again,

746
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,220
I'll bring more to you.

747
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,610
It's okay.

748
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,810
The preserved almonds are so sweet.

749
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,020
How did you know I like sweets?

750
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,800
You guessed it again,

751
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,220
right?

752
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,910
Your Highness.

753
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,240
Which direction

754
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,270
did you say just now?

755
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,430
I forgot.

756
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,840
It's okay. You don't need to remember it.

757
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,970
I'll take you there.

758
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,480
Wait.

759
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,630
I'll take you there.

760
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,730
Your Highness.

761
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,640
But I...

762
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,450
This is...

763
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,840
What is it?

764
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,160
Don't just sweep the floor.

765
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,360
Clean that place up too.

766
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,790
OK?

767
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,020
Then go over there.

768
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,440
Your Highness.

769
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,760
Your Highness.

770
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,620
Didn't you go visit the Legitimate Eldest Prince?

771
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,020
Why are you back so early?

772
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,030
I was too lazy to socialize,

773
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,290
so I told him I had a stomachache and came back.

774
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,600
You're indeed my prince.

775
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,750
You've always had stomachaches.

776
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,800
[Head supervisor, Su Shen]

777
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,840
And you used it as an excuse without hesitation.

778
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,900
Ordinary people can never be so quick-witted as you.

779
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,430
You don't have to fawn on me.

780
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,880
Anyone can think of this.

781
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,640
How could it be?

782
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,540
I can't.

783
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,240
Your Highness, there's no need to keep pretending.

784
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,930
You're still covering your stomach now that you're back.

785
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,660
Thoughtful.

786
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,290
Prudent.

787
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,270
It really hurts.

788
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,890
It really hurts?

789
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,890
So your old illness is acting up again.

790
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,850
It must be that you didn't eat much for lunch

791
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,080
to cater to Mr. Dai's taste, right?

792
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,610
Look at this.

793
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,310
You've never liked meat or fish.

794
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,620
Look what those people have done.

795
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,320
Go get some rest.

796
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,250
Go get some rest.

797
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,340
No.

798
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,910
You should eat first.

799
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,920
I'll go ask them to serve dinner right away.

800
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,380
Chef Liu Baoquan once received your help.

801
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,180
He is one of us.

802
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
The food is ready.

803
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,180
The ribs

804
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,310
have been blanched through hot water.

805
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,510
Can you stop talking?

806
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,970
I'm starving.

807
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,980
Why isn't Hao Jia back yet?

808
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,900
I'm so hungry.

809
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,310
This is the last dish.

810
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,140
It's past time to eat.

811
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,430
There's still so much left.

812
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,230
It'll be a waste if I don't eat it.

813
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,500
Baoquan.

814
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,530
Liu Baoquan.

815
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,570
Liu Baoquan.

816
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,530
Are you there?

817
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,480
Are the dishes ready?

818
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,190
Hurry up.

819
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,409
Prince Zheng is back.

820
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,600
His stomach illness is acting up from hunger again.

821
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,330
The dish serving...

822
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,000
You're still caring about etiquettes

823
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,159
at this time?

824
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,460
I...

825
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,580
Supervisor Su.

826
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,139
Just in time.

827
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,889
Prince Zheng's stomach illness has acted up again.

828
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:30,600
Serve the meal first.

829
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,900
He needs to take medicine right after the meal.

830
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,679
Prepare the medicine

831
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,420
according to the old prescription.

832
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:33,850
OK?

833
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:34,610
Hurry.

834
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,250
I told you to run.

835
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,699
Liu Baoquan.

836
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,409
I've cooperated with you.

837
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,679
Why didn't you tell me the dish is ready?

838
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,850
Steamed egg with pumpkin.

839
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,510
Hurry up with the next dishes.

840
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,639
Coming.

841
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,469
Steamed egg with pumpkin.

842
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,940
Your Highness, warm your stomach first.

843
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,930
Where is the egg?

844
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,400
There must be a mistake.

845
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,210
Wait a moment, Your Highness.

846
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,190
Your Highness.

847
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,190
Osmanthus cakes.

848
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,720
Broiled broccoli.

849
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,320
Broad beans with lily bulbs.

850
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,660
Broiled asparagus.

851
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,630
Oh no.

852
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,360
There's nothing left to place on the plate.

853
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,090
Liu Baoquan.

854
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,340
This one.

855
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,490
Liu Baoquan.

856
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,430
I'll give you one last chance.

857
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,210
It's no use hiding from me.

858
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,470
I won't let you off if you mess it up again.

859
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,810
The damn palace rules.

860
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,760
Bed spareribs.

861
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,800
I'll deal with you later.

862
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,950
Broiled

863
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,300
spareribs.

864
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,570
It must be because I'm the one who opened it the past few times.

865
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,370
Please do it yourself this time.

866
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:02,650
What?

867
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,960
This is the jade pendant of the female candidates for selection.

868
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,910
Why is it here?

869
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,440
Your Highness.

870
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,250
This looks much better.

871
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,840
It's still crooked.

872
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,770
You don't understand.

873
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,870
Oh no.

874
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,850
This man wears luxurious clothes,

875
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,370
and he lives in the Prince Mansion.

876
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,610
Probably a prince.

877
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,150
What do you do?

878
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,920
I'm the poison tester here.

879
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,120
The dishes served to the princes

880
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,840
have to be tried by me first

881
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,040
before served.

882
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,470
These dishes are fine.

883
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,650
I'm leaving.

884
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,760
I've never seen

885
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,890
someone who tests poison with his/her own mouth before.

886
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,400
Which mansion

887
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,200
are you from?

888
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,850
Which mansion...

889
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,690
I heard that Prince Zheng is weak and sick.

890
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,320
It's hard for him to achieve great things.

891
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,520
So Lord Xinchuan doesn't care about him that much.

892
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,140
The palace is full of snobs.

893
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,290
Naturally, people

894
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,540
don't care much about him either.

895
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,370
In that case,

896
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,850
he has a low sense of presence here.

897
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,550
Prince Zheng.

898
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,510
Prince Zheng?

899
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,620
Tell me what he looks like.

900
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,450
He...

901
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,620
He is

902
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,080
quite vague.

903
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,410
Vague?

904
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,010
Tell me about it.

905
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,940
He has a low sense of presence.

906
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,680
It's hard for you to find him among a group of people.

907
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,680
Even if he stands right in front of you,

908
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,140
you may not recognize him.

909
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,150
It feels like he's not even in the palace.

910
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,700
Your description is quite accurate.

911
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,600
I'll ask him to reward you

912
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,930
when I meet him someday.

913
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,460
No need.

914
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,550
I'm just a poison tester.

915
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,470
Well,

916
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,620
since everything is fine here,

917
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,020
I'll get going.

918
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,780
What's wrong with you?

919
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,750
An old illness.

920
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,240
Stomachache.

921
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,890
Stomachache?

922
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,810
Stomachache... We need to go see the imperial physician.

923
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,650
Go see the imperial physician.

924
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,180
Let's go.

925
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,510
Get up.

926
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,690
Hurry. Let's go to the imperial physician.

927
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,010
Are you alright?

928
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,200
One.

929
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,770
Two.

930
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,380
Three.

931
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,170
-I can do it myself. -Let me.

932
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,930
Sleeves.

933
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,520
My stomach is not the only place that hurts now.

934
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,420
Turn left.

935
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,120
I don't remember which mansion he's from.

936
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,320
I don't know who he is.

937
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,900
I don't know if his stomachache gets better.

938
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,000
I wanted to send him to the Imperial Hospital,

939
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,720
but he insisted that he was busy

940
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,680
and asked me to send him back to the Prince Mansion.

941
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,540
He had such a severe stomachache.

942
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,850
Why did he go back to the Prince Mansion?

943
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,640
Was he trying to report me?

944
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,880
Will I die?

945
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,380
No, you won't.

946
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,550
Don't be afraid.

947
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,410
You don't know him.

948
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,940
He doesn't know you either.

949
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,410
Besides, there are so many girls

950
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,320
in the palace for the selection today.

951
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,800
Even if they want to investigate,

952
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,850
they might not be able to trace it back to us.

953
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,730
It's getting dark soon.

954
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,650
The sedan to take you out of the palace may arrive

955
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,590
before dark.

956
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,590
After you get back to Jichuan,

957
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,840
how can they catch you

958
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,810
from so far away?

959
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,420
If I can rush back home,

960
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
it'll be the time to eat lotus roots.

961
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,110
I wonder if I can be in time for that.

962
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,100
Miss Li.

963
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,340
Miss Li.

964
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,680
The sedan for you is waiting at the gate.

965
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,560
They're here.

966
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,520
I didn't expect them to come so soon.

967
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,240
Great.

968
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,590
It must be hard to fit in Xinchuan Palace.

969
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,140
You'll be alone from now on.

970
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,190
You must be careful.

971
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,510
I'm leaving.

972
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,990
Go.

973
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,990
I'm leaving.

974
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,630
When I get home,

975
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,580
I'll send you lotus roots.

976
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,640
In such a big bag.

977
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,040
I'll send them all to you.

978
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,740
Hurry up. We are all waiting.

979
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,290
Why is this sedan

980
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,760
red?

981
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,980
Of course it's red.

982
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,890
You're the first one to get the marriage bestowed by the Lord.

983
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:54,890
Marriage?

984
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,270
I knew that

985
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,400
you must have a promising future, Concubine of Prince Zheng.

986
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,930
Concubine of Prince Zheng?

987
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,680
The Sixth Prince's concubine?

988
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,600
Right. Prince Zheng.

989
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,220
What?

990
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,970
Get on the sedan. Don't miss the time.

991
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,550
Nanny.

992
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,050
You must be mistaken.

993
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:10,930
No.

994
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,830
I was surprised too.

995
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,090
How could you not fail?

996
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,450
Let's go.

997
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,060
♫What's the finest delicacy in the world?♫

998
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,460
♫Heating up a pot of tea and feeling the time pass by silently♫

999
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,850
♫Apricot flowers flowing in the stream where fish is thriving♫

1000

♫Followed by poetic charm and pictorial splendor♫

1005

♫Despite the various beautiful scenery all year round♫
