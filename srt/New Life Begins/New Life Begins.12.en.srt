[Episode 12]

4
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,330
Father, you promised that Li from Jichuan could be promoted to my legal wife.

5
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,930
Please fulfill the promise.

6
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,229
When did I promise you?

7
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:45,960
Besides,

8
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,120
don't you know the benefits of marrying a princess?

9
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,090
Benefits?

10
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,229
I can't even get someone to treat me sincerely.

11
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,830
What benefits are there?

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,410
If there were benefits,

13
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,540
would it be my turn?

14
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,050
You...

15
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:03,760
Yin Zheng.

16
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,710
You are Prince Zheng of Xinchuan Palace.

17
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,949
Of course your marriage is not up to you.

18
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,750
This marriage

19
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,750
is a reward and your responsibility.

20
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,950
You just received the order to be on court.

21
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,520
It can be withdrawn anytime.

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,380
You should know

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,170
a prince who was expelled from the court

24
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,930
is useless.

25
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,270
Yin Zheng.

26
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,710
If you insist on doing this,

27
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,610
you're despising the Lord

28
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
and his gift of grace.

29
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,840
This matter

30
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,200
is settled.

31
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,870
No more discussion.

32
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,050
Your Ladyship.

33
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,700
Chef Liu made another dish.

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
It's Prince Zheng's first day in court today.

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,170
Her Ladyship asked the chefs to prepare so much delicious food.

36
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,300
Prince Zheng must be happy to see them.

37
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,650
Here.

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,090
Smells good.

39
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,440
Why didn't you take out the ginger?

40
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,450
Let me do it.

41
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,500
Put them away.

42
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,980
Prince Zheng is here.

43
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,960
You're back.

44
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,110
The opening ceremony

45
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,070
is almost ready.

46
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,910
The renovation of the house will be completed in two days.

47
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,510
The guest list of the banquet

48
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,370
and the menu

49
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,690
are also ready.

50
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,970
You've worked hard on your first day.

51
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,890
I asked the chefs to prepare something delicious.

52
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,190
Let's have dinner together.

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,360
What's wrong?

54
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,060
Did something happen in the court?

55
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,600
What happened?

56
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,140
Tell me.

57
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,110
No matter what the problem is,

58
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,510
we'll solve it together.

59
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Ladyship.

60
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,830
After the court meeting,

61
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,970
Lord Xinchuan summoned Prince Zheng

62
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,940
and granted a marriage.

63
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,560
Her Ladyship.

64
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,940
Her Ladyship.

65
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,850
Her Ladyship.

66
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:30,950
This...

67
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,810
Your Ladyship.

68
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,390
Say it.

69
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,640
Your Ladyship,

70
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,720
we've asked around.

71
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,530
She is the only daughter of Lord Jinchuan.

72
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,820
Her name is Yuanying.

73
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,970
Your Ladyship.

74
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,810
Take it easy.

75
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,540
The Lord made this arrangement

76
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
for the relationship between the two regions.

77
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,420
Yes.

78
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Your Ladyship,

79
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,950
you haven't eaten anything all day.

80
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,590
You should eat something.

81
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,390
Don't starve yourself.

82
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,310
But I'm not hungry at all.

83
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,180
Come sit with me.

84
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,909
I wonder if she will like

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,050
this yard or not.

86
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,700
The bride is here.

87
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,710
The auspicious time has come.

88
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,400
Please bow to heaven and earth with your wife.

89
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,010
Here.

90
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,460
So much.

91
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,960
Smells good.

92
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,540
Take your time to eat when you go back.

93
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Bow.

94
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,440
Bow again.

95
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,910
Prince Zheng and Lady

96
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,570
bow to the Lord.

97
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,920
Bow to Madam Xinchuan.

98
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Bow.

99
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,320
Bow again.

100
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,450
Please bow to each other.

101
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,550
May you support each other

102
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,370
and live together forever.

103
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,520
No matter how humble

104
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,730
a Jichuan girl is,

105
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,680
she will never share her love with others.

106
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,890
Since he made his choice,

107
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,230
I'll go home.

108
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,870
I'll go back to Jichuan

109
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,710
and never come back.

110
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,390
Your Ladyship.

111
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,660
All right.

112
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,700
I'm tired.

113
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,840
Leave me alone.

114
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,730
But...

115
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,370
Wei.

116
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,520
Where is she?

117
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,250
I don't know.

118
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,380
You said she's here.

119
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,810
Yes.

120
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,110
She seems to be over there.

121
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,670
What happened?

122
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,810
Why are you crying?

123
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,510
Han said you were missing.

124
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,910
We searched everywhere.

125
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,060
Don't cry.

126
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,790
They

127
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,000
have finished the ceremony.

128
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,720
Yin Zheng.

129
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,200
Princess Yuanying came all the way from Jinchuan to marry you.

130
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,890
Be more considerate.

131
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,310
From now on, you should respect and love each other

132
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,710
and be together forever.

133
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,700
Understand?

134
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,540
Yin Zheng.

135
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,510
I

136
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,070
understand.

137
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,140
Yuanying.

138
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,340
Yin Zheng works hard in court every day.

139
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,730
As his wife,

140
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,360
you should know how to handle housework

141
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,050
and take care of the family.

142
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,160
Yes.

143
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,140
Even if they worshipped the mourning hall, it has nothing to do with you.

144
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,710
I thought Yin Zheng was a good guy.

145
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,640
Look what he did!

146
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,110
Don't cry.

147
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,050
I'll seek justice for you.

148
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,650
Princess,

149
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,540
Li Wei is the most important now.

150
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,620
Ignore them.

151
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,360
We'll take you out for a walk.

152
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,000
No one will check today.

153
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,540
We can come back before the gate is locked.

154
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,080
Yes.

155
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:14,980
Let's go.

156
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,100
Take a break.

157
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,290
That's bullying.

158
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,040
Miss.

159
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,770
Keep your voice down.

160
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,170
Li Wei is enough trouble.

161
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,450
Now they're forcing dear Zheng to marry another wife.

162
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,610
Are they human?

163
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,810
Miss Song.

164
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,070
Can we keep it down?

165
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,490
It's bad for Prince Zheng if others hear it.

166
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,980
What did dear Zheng say?

167
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,110
What can he say?

168
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,030
The match made by the Lord's order

169
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,030
can't be refused.

170
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,280
They already had the wedding ceremony.

171
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,850
What?

172
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,340
I blew it.

173
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,460
Baifu.

174
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,820
They're bullying us.

175
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,200
One after another.

176
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,900
How many are there?

177
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,210
When will it end?

178
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,170
Baifu.

179
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,330
They are bullying us.

180
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,290
Miss,

181
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,180
use this.

182
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,140
They're too much.

183
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,280
Baifu.

184
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,800
Princess Yuanying.

185
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,190
I have something to say

186
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,670
about this marriage.

187
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,150
[Yuanying, Princess of Jinchuan]

188
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,540
What a coincidence.

189
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,830
I have something to say to you too.

190
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,310
Please.

191
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,880
I'm sure you know

192
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,480
the most important thing to Jinchuan

193
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,850
is business.

194
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,230
Our marriage

195
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,450
is just a deal between

196
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,280
the Lords of the two regions.

197
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,640
We

198
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,930
are just two commodities.

199
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,890
But I don't want to be collateral.

200
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,740
This marriage is not what I want.

201
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,160
Right now, neither of us can turn things around.

202
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,320
In that case,

203
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,210
I'll behave well as your wife.

204
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,040
I know you

205
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,950
tried your best to go to court.

206
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,250
It shows that you are ambitious.

207
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,670
But now,

208
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,790
the Lord didn't say anything about

209
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,960
your duties.

210
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,100
I think your career is still unstable.

211
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,850
At this time,

212
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,130
your mansion can't be in chaos.

213
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:36,840
You

214
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,720
need a good wife.

215
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,170
Do you mean that

216
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,530
you want to help me manage the mansion?

217
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,240
I will be your backup.

218
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,680
When you're in the court,

219
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,880
I hope you can persuade Lord Xinchuan

220
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,920
to let me go.

221
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,250
Do you mean that

222
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,700
we should part when the time is right?

223
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,130
Exactly.

224
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,720
However,

225
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,650
Xinchuan Palace has strict rules.

226
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,910
Women will only be dismissed.

227
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,590
I hope you understand that

228
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,520
I will only part with my husband when he dies or when we divorce on mutual agreement.

229
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,050
But I can't be dismissed for making mistakes.

230
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,330
If I have to leave,

231
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,190
I want to leave

232
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,200
with dignity.

233
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,070
Princess Jinchuan is famous in the world.

234
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,530
You're really ambitious.

235
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,650
So,

236
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,380
do you agree?

237
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,300
I have something to tell you in advance.

238
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,030
I have a concubine named Li Wei.

239
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,400
I wanted to promote her to my legal wife.

240
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,150
This won't change.

241
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,740
I see.

242
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,520
I've heard about Li Wei.

243
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,089
She comes from a poor family.

244
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,450
She's with limited ability.

245
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,310
She doesn't deserve the title of Lady of the Prince.

246
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,640
To thank you for your sincere cooperation,

247
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,150
I'm willing to help you fulfill your wish.

248
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,730
I will teach Li Wei

249
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,630
how to become a qualified Lady of the Prince.

250
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,050
I wish you two happiness.

251
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,420
Happy cooperation.

252
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,230
Are you drunk?

253
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,230
A bad drinker

254
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,900
will hold me back too.

255
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,620
I didn't.

256
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,790
Get some rest.

257
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,260
Princess Yuanying is really...

258
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,850
Seeing that you got drunk after one cup,

259
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,450
she dislikes you in a way

260
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,090
that disqualifies her as a lady.

261
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,980
She wouldn't be my wife anyway.

262
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,300
Did I

263
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,230
lose control of myself?

264
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,650
No.

265
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,060
Your acting is good.

266
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,750
Acting?

267
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,470
I mean you've been stable since you were a child.

268
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,170
You won't lose your manners in front of others.

269
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,380
Before you left, you saluted to the Princess.

270
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,440
You only fell after you left the room.

271
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,850
You had been thinking about how to promote Her Ladyship.

272
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,930
Who knew you were going to marry Princess Yuanying?

273
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,050
The god of destiny makes fools of the people.

274
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,850
I'm afraid that Her Ladyship...

275
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,100
Prince.

276
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,000
Prince.

277
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,750
Her Ladyship is asleep.

278
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,460
I have something to say.

279
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,520
It's not convenient today.

280
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,660
Why not?

281
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,900
I want to see her.

282
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,840
But it's really not convenient today,

283
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,440
Prince.

284
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,950
Please leave.

285
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,100
I only have one word.

286
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,680
Prince, please leave.

287
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,330
Her Ladyship is really asleep.

288
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:49,790
Prince.

289
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,260
It's not that you can't see her,

290
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,250
but not today.

291
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,010
Are you done?

292
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,340
Bastard!

293
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,620
Zheng.

294
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,380
She is fine.

295
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,710
Don't worry.

296
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,240
You had your wedding ceremony.

297
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,390
She was sad alone.

298
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,860
Jing, Jia and I

299
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,280
took her out for a walk.

300
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,500
That's all.

301
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,670
Anyway, that's what happened.

302
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,810
Look.

303
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,670
Believe it or not.

304
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,550
She's home.

305
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,380
I'll leave now.

306
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,740
Thank you.

307
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,630
We had a deal.

308
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,910
Yin Zheng.

309
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,720
You liar!

310
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,910
We had a deal.

311
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,090
You liar!

312
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,100
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I will take care of

314
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,830
this matter.

315
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,710
Your Ladyship.

316
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,210
The Ministry of Internal Affairs sent us here.

317
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,580
After we open the mansion,

318
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,310
we'll help you manage the affairs in the mansion.

319
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,830
My surname is Zhuang.

320
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,600
Everyone in the palace calls me Nanny Zhuang.

321
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,710
From now on,

322
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,770
we need to help you about the inner courtyard.

323
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,790
After all, you are young.

324
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,690
You don't know what's important.

325
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,960
Please forgive us.

326
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,970
The four of us should take care of the servants,

327
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,060
the backyard,

328
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,980
the storage room and sundries.

329
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,260
There are two keys to the storage room.

330
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,170
We keep one.

331
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,400
You keep one.

332
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,410
I don't know the rules of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Xinchuan.

333
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,560
But in my mansion,

334
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,940
the nannies shouldn't speak

335
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,800
before they get my permission.

336
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,550
Your Ladyship,

337
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,020
you've misunderstood.

338
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,370
Nanny Zhuang

339
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,990
was just trying to help you.

340
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,930
Opening the mansion is a big matter.

341
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,300
Anything could happen.

342
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,520
The four of us

343
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,830
are the most experienced.

344
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
We're afraid that

345
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,740
you're new here...

346
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,930
Since you are so experienced,

347
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
let me ask you.

348
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,290
Someone came to see me in the storage room today.

349
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,830
They said the charcoal didn't match the booklet.

350
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,560
20 taels worth of it is missing.

351
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,930
The charcoal was given to maids from all places.

352
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,610
Some were sent from the storage room.

353
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,670
Some maids went to get it themselves.

354
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,580
Nannies,

355
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,440
how did you manage it?

356
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,160
You all want to make easy money.

357
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,140
None of you wants to take the responsibility.

358
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,780
None of you wants to take the responsibility.

359
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,710
You're dismissed from your posts.

360
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,260
I'll arrange others to take your places.

361
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,280
All you need to do is report to me every month.

362
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,570
But whenever I ask you,

363
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,830
you have to answer me clearly.

364
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,010
I don't have any hobbies.

365
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,030
I just like reading ledgers.

366
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,700
From now on,

367
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,580
I will manage the ledgers

368
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,920
and the keys to the storage room myself.

369
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
-But, I... -Did I allow you to speak?

370
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,060
If you are not summoned,

371
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,980
please don't wander around.

372
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,740
Learn the rules from Butler Su.

373
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,360
If you do well,

374
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,850
you will be rewarded.

375
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,540
If you make mistakes,

376
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,890
you will be punished physically.

377
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,670
If you can't stay here,

378
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,240
I won't force you to stay.

379
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,860
Explain to the Ministry of Internal Affairs yourselves.

380
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,710
You may leave.

381
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,240
Yes.

382
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Don't be nervous.

383
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,470
I just checked the ledgers.

384
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,400
I found many unreasonable things.

385
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,930
We need to shorten our manpower

386
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,330
and reduce the expenses.

387
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,460
What earrings were the two nannies

388
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,020
who spoke just now wearing?

389
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,310
Your Ladyship.

390
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,800
The right one wore jade ones.

391
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
The one beside her wore silver ones.

392
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,940
You two can stay.

393
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,030
Don't worry about the other two.

394
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,810
I'll let the Ministry of Internal Affairs take care of them.

395
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,340
Yes.

396
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,470
What are your names?

397
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,800
Your Ladyship.

398
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,100
My name is Pomegranate.

399
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Her name is Grape.

400
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,700
They were given by Big Nanny.

401
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,360
[Grape, Maid]

402
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,360
[Pomegranate, Maid]

403
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,880
They symbolize having more children and blessings.

404
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,070
I'm not here to have children.

405
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,450
You're good at saying auspicious words.

406
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,990
If you say it to other masters,

407
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,190
it'll be good for you.

408
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,410
But you don't have to flatter me.

409
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,140
I don't want to let down those

410
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,440
who are serious about their work but not good with words.

411
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:35,780
Yes.

412
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,730
Your Ladyship.

413
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,940
If no one is present,

414
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,930
you don't have to call me Lady.

415
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,190
Just call me Princess.

416
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,720
Yes, Princess.

417
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,720
You may leave.

418
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,990
These are the new banquet procedure and guest list.

419
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
The previous procedure was too complicated.

420
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,210
An open banquet is interesting,

421
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,480
but it's not suitable for opening the mansion.

422
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,540
It's better to change back to the traditional banquet.

423
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,090
I'll do it now.

424
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,800
You must be Chef Liu Baoquan.

425
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,660
Yes.

426
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,550
Your Ladyship.

427
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,180
The menu for the banquet is here.

428
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,780
Take and study it carefully.

429
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
Ask me if you have any questions.

430
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,660
But Your Ladyship,

431
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,370
for the opening banquet, Her Ladyship...

432
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,650
That menu is not suitable for the banquet.

433
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,270
Some dishes are complicated.

434
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,500
If you can't handle it,

435
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,540
it'll be a mess.

436
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,270
Also,

437
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,890
I'm sure people will want to drink on an occasion like this.

438
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,620
Don't make any sticky pastries that are hard to digest.

439
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,740
The guests will feel uncomfortable after eating it.

440
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,870
Yes, Your Ladyship.

441
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,540
Thank you.

442
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,490
Get back to work.

443
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:39,830
OK.

444
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,830
Great-aunt.

445
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,000
Greetings, I am Yin An.

446
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,550
Uncle, what did he call me?

447
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:02,840
What uncle?

448
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,390
We're not strangers.

449
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,790
Let me introduce myself.

450
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm Yin An, the Third Prince of Xinchuan.

451
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,840
My birth mother is from Jinchuan.

452
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,510
She's your cousin's granddaughter in terms of seniority.

453
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,770
That's so distant.

454
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,600
You don't have to talk about family with me.

455
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,440
I have to.

456
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,370
Look.

457
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,340
We are both from Jinchuan.

458
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,110
I think you know a lot about business too.

459
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,360
I have many shops in Xinchuan.

460
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,120
If you are willing,

461
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,520
we should work together.

462
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,820
I'll go about soliciting business deals.

463
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,120
You lend money in the mansion.

464
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,340
Let's create wonders together.

465
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,230
No need.

466
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,780
I'm not interested.

467
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:44,700
Great-aunt,

468
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,850
if you're not interested in lending money,

469
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,250
then let's talk about the shops.

470
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:48,840
I have shops in markets in the East,

471
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,380
West, South, and North

472
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:49,960
for you to choose.

473
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,850
You just need to invest,

474
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,010
I'll do all the work.

475
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:52,750
OK?

476
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,900
You can choose from all these places.

477
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,730
A small investment brings a ten thousand-fold profit.

478
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,050
Great-aunt.

479
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,740
The Third Prince is really scary.

480
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,300
Is he really from Jinchuan?

481
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,730
It doesn't look like it.

482
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,440
I heard he has a lot of business outside.

483
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,370
His shops are all over Xinchuan.

484
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,830
This is really the style of Jinchuan.

485
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,060
Your Ladyship,

486
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,780
I have asked them to do the things

487
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,120
you arranged.

488
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,450
Don't worry.

489
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,200
I promise everything will be arranged properly.

490
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,150
Thank you.

491
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,340
If there's nothing else, I'll...

492
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,630
There are some things.

493
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,160
Butler Su, please remember

494
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,540
a total of 88 notes and 327 detailed rules

495
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,130
for opening the mansion.

496
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,760
Your Ladyship,

497
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,570
you wrote these on your wedding night?

498
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,440
Yes.

499
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,330
There are other booklets too.

500
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,970
I'll give them to you one by one

501
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,300
so as not to get mixed up.

502
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,720
After opening the mansion,

503
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,520
everything has to be regulated.

504
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:09,990
Yes.

505
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,300
First,

506
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,360
the inner courtyard servers are not allowed to wander around.

507
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,900
They must act in pairs to supervise each other.

508
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,760
Your Ladyship,

509
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,530
you've memorized it.

510
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,890
I've had wide learning and a highly retentive memory since I was young.

511
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,360
Second,

512
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,980
it's not easy to clean the outer courtyard.

513
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,410
No one is allowed to go out except the incumbent.

514
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,270
-Offenders will be caned 18 times. -Your Ladyship.

515
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,190
I can read.

516
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,140
I'll take a closer look when I go back.

517
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,420
Listening is the best way to remember.

518
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,190
Third,

519
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,610
in the future, if it's not allowed by the masters,

520
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,780
the inner servers are not allowed to enter Prince Zheng's study.

521
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,320
No wandering outside the study.

522
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,770
There are two small doors between the study and the inner courtyard.

523
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,550
They must be guarded day and night.

524
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,560
No one is allowed to leave without reason.

525
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,770
[Real Interest]

526
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,120
Offenders will be caned 18 times.

527
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,730
Your Ladyship.

528
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,160
Do you have to leave?

529
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,800
I've asked around.

530
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,630
The Lord insisted on this marriage.

531
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,810
It has nothing to do with Prince.

532
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,010
It's hard for him too.

533
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,260
Yuping, why did you stop persuading?

534
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,290
Don't you hope that

535
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,950
Her Ladyship and Prince will have a happy ending

536
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,810
at this point?

537
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,930
Staying here will only make people sad.

538
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,020
Forget it.

539
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,100
Well.

540
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,310
Your Ladyship, bring some food.

541
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,020
Don't be sad.

542
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,150
We will meet each other eventually.

543
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,650
It's too hard

544
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,350
for two people to be together.

545
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,480
It's normal for him to change his mind.

546
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
I don't blame him.

547
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,480
But I don't want to choose him either.

548
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,220
I know it's hard for him.

549
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:17,830
I...

550
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,460
I just can't accept this arrangement.

551
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,100
Prince.

552
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,820
Li Wei is not here.

553
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,420
You don't have to come again.

554
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,460
I have something to tell you.

555
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,920
I don't want to talk to you.

556
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,940
I have made it clear to Princess Yuanying.

557
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,610
What you said to her

558
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,550
has nothing to do with me.

559
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,990
Please leave.

560
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,010
Li Wei.

561
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,820
Your Ladyship.

562
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,120
Prince must be upset too.

563
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,690
Why don't you meet him?

564
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,090
No.

565
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,110
You can meet him if you want.

566
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,710
I said I don't want to see you.

567
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,730
It's me.

568
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,580
I just passed by the yard.

569
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,640
Guess what I heard.

570
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,460
What?

571
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,210
Yuanying is very sharp.

572
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,460
She returned the people

573
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,290
sent by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

574
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,330
And she has set new rules for the mansion.

575
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,800
No one is allowed to go near the study.

576
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,980
Offenders will be caned 18 times.

577
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,820
No one is allowed to walk alone in the mansion.

578
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,080
Offenders will be caned 18 times.

579
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,460
No one is allowed to go out at will.

580
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,320
Offenders will be caned 18 times.

581
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,150
Let's go.

582
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,010
Let's deal with her together.

583
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,040
According to the storytelling script,

584
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,700
I won't survive this chapter.

585
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,490
I have to go.

586
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,130
I blew it.

587
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:54,870
Coward.

588
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,470
You and dear Zheng suit each other perfectly.

589
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,350
How can you give up the person you like?

590
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,370
What are you talking about?

591
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,320
No, I didn't.

592
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,550
I have to go.

593
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,670
Your Ladyship.

594
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,110
Lady wants to see you.

595
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,570
Please.

596
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,300
Miss Song.

597
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,710
I have something to say to Li Wei.

598
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,710
Please excuse us.

599
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,800
If I leave,

600
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,670
who knows how you will hurt

601
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,380
Li Wei, my best friend?

602
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,010
Besides,

603
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,610
why should I leave?

604
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,719
I have a reason to stand here.

605
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,580
Good luck.

606
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,199
Take care.

607
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,170
Miss Li.

608
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,330
Don't be nervous.

609
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,480
I...

610
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,590
I'm not nervous.

611
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,870
Can you read the ledger?

612
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,940
Have you ever kept the accounts for Prince Zheng?

613
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,860
No.

614
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,320
Do you know about

615
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,370
monthly payment

616
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,160
and personnel management?

617
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,050
I read some books.

618
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,520
I know a thing or two.

619
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,780
You don't seem to know.

620
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,580
Then, do you know

621
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,940
how to host a banquet

622
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,060
and table manners?

623
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,410
I've learned a little about these.

624
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,140
Food is what I'm best at.

625
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,100
Best at?

626
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,390
I've seen your menu of the opening ceremony banquet.

627
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,920
There are a lot of problems.

628
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,250
You make the menu then.

629
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,080
I have something to do. I have to go now.

630
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,630
Wait.

631
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,910
Go with me to meet Prince Zheng.

632
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,300
Let's talk things out.

633
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,710
Why?

634
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,040
I don't want to see him now.

635
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,370
The mouth should be used

636
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,310
to clarify the misunderstanding.

637
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,350
Ears should be used

638
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,010
to listen to others' arguments.

639
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,210
Do not avoid problems

640
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,130
because of pretension or fear of confrontation.

641
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,390
Talking back and forth

642
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,830
is a waste of time.

643
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,310
Let's go.

644
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,340
Misunderstanding?

645
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
Prince Zheng has discussed with me.

646
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,300
Once he's secured in the court,

647
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,860
he must set me free.

648
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,240
What?

649
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,770
Surprised?

650
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,430
I don't want to get involved in your business.

651
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,770
My father thinks that I am a precious commodity

652
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,400
and wanted to use my marriage as a bargaining chip.

653
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,850
So,

654
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,060
he chose the most promising one

655
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,930
among the Princes of Xinchuan.

656
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,450
I had no choice but to stoop here.

657
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,200
It was just a temporary plan.

658
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,290
To Yin Zheng,

659
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm just his assistant.

660
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:32,820
As for you,

661
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,980
he wants you

662
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,450
to be his wife.

663
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,730
It's up to you.

664
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,130
If you agree,

665
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,610
I'll be your teacher in the future.

666
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,520
I'll supervise your academic conduct

667
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,770
until you can manage the inner court.

668
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,180
Are you

669
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,980
still willing?

670
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,690
I don't know.

671
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,550
I need to think about it.

672
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,330
Me coming to Xinchuan

673
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,610
is a mistake that needs to be corrected urgently.

674
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,520
A match against people's will

675
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,240
is like a forced purchase.

676
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,170
I didn't give up fighting.

677
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,420
You two love each other.

678
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,500
Do you

679
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,870
still want to surrender?

680
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,330
Li Wei,

681
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,960
I know

682
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,330
you're upset.

683
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,810
Because he didn't refuse the marriage.

684
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,730
But for the thing I can't even do,

685
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,890
it's not surprising that he failed.

686
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,480
Prince Zheng is a promising man.

687
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,750
When he is mature,

688
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,830
he will be able to overcome all difficulties with you

689
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,160
and be with you forever.

690
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,110
OK.

691
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,830
It's settled then.

692
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
For the future that all three of us want,

693
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,630
we all should not

694
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,850
give up.

695
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,780
What are they talking about?

696
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,070
I can't hear anything.

697
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,930
Judging from their expressions,

698
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,810
is Yuanying going to kick Li Wei out?

699
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,420
No way.

700
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,540
Li Wei,

701
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,060
I have made a plan for you.

702
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,310
From now on,

703
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,380
you must follow the plan strictly

704
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,460
and become a qualified wife of Prince Zheng as soon as possible.

705
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,260
Pomegranate.

706
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,970
There's no need to force her.

707
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,600
You're right.

708
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,430
These books are for you.

709
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,710
Only the one at the top

710
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,630
is what Li Wei needs to learn.

711
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,950
Is that Li Wei's divorce letter?

712
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,500
That's too much.

713
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,360
She asked dear Zheng to hand the divorce letter to Li Wei.

714
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,300
I have made a plan

715
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,820
for you.

716
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,910
[Detailed Record of Jinchuan Trade]

717
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,730
Now,

718
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,970
the first thing you need to solve

719
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,750
is the follow-up repayment of Jinchuan's debt.

720
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,770
Xinchuan didn't remind us to pay back the debt.

721
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,190
Therefore,

722
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,240
Lord Xinchuan is not satisfied with

723
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,330
the ways to raise money put up by the other Princes.

724
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,690
That's your best chance.

725
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,530
I agree with you.

726
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,740
May I ask,

727
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,870
can I withdraw from

728
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,560
your plan?

729
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,680
I want to go home.

730
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,370
-No. - No.

731
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,330
Who are you to say no?

732
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,860
You have the right to say no?

733
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,780
I'm sorry.

734
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,520
Since I've made it clear,

735
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,840
you should do your own jobs.

736
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,170
Study.

737
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,900
Yuanying,

738
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,990
don't try to occupy the nest

739
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,180
and kick out Li Wei.

740
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,040
Miss.

741
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,640
Li Wei, don't be afraid.

742
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,850
I won't run away this time.

743
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,270
I'm the only one who can kick you out of this house.

744
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,670
She...

745
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,460
Don't even think about it.

746
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,390
Song Wu.

747
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,570
She didn't mean to kick me out.

748
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,430
What you tore off was the document Yuanying gave me.

749
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,410
Song Wu.

750
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,320
Apologize.

751
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,770
I...

752
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,130
-Why? -Miss Song is the goddaughter of Madam He.

753
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,380
She's not a member of the mansion.

754
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,980
I have no right to interfere.

755
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,810
Madam He has to come

756
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,660
personally.

757
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,440
I'm sorry, okay?

758
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,790
The document has been torn apart.

759
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,500
An apology can't restore it.

760
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,040
But Li Wei

761
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,140
has to read.

762
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,630
So,

763
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,260
Miss Song,

764
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,490
please

765
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,910
stick it back

766
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,030
piece by piece.

767
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,100
♫What's the finest delicacy in the world?♫

768
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:42,180
♫Heating up a pot of tea and feeling the time pass by silently♫

769
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,610
♫Apricot flowers flowing in the stream where fish is thriving♫

770
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,660
♫Just drink up the fine wine in our glass♫

771
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,520
♫What are you longing for in the passage of time?♫

772
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,900
♫Boiling morning dew that reflects the moon and starlight♫

773
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,160
♫Snow falling in winter, drunk in the spring breeze♫

774
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,210
♫Followed by poetic charm and pictorial splendor♫

775
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,720
♫Despite the various beautiful scenery all year round♫

776
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,330
♫The most fortunate thing is my encounter with you♫

777
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,710
♫Watching the myriad twinkling lights and dim candlelight of the city♫

778
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,480
♫One of them is waiting for me to come home♫

779
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,670
♫Ordinary meals can be so tasty and enjoyable♫

780
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,810
♫The most important thing is to be with you every day♫

781
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,230
♫It's the best time of harvesting red carps and green plums♫

782
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,260
♫The finest delicacy in the world♫

783
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,120
