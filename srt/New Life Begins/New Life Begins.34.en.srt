4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,289
He was fine just now.

5
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,250
Then he suddenly had a stomachache.

6
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,280
He had a stomachache.

7
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,080
Stomachache!

8
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,240
Where is he?

9
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,440
Here.

10
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,320
Hurry up.

11
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,850
My Lady.

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,039
Yin Zheng.

13
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:50,610
Yin Zheng.

14
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,990
How are you, Yin Zheng?

15
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,590
Yin Zheng.

16
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,009
I can put up with it.

17
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,990
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,370
Go see the imperial physician.

19
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,430
Check if the lights

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,860
on the water look good.

21
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm okay.

22
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,420
Were you pretending to be sick?

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,300
I didn't mean to make a scene today.

24
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,500
I just got a little...

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,020
A little jealous?

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,420
I wouldn't say "jealous".

27
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,540
Yes.

28
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,270
Prince Zheng of Xinchuan got jealous.

29
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,300
The food today

30
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,750
and the food we had when Xiao Yang came to our mansion last time

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,200
were actually all cooked by me.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
But you said something unpleasant.

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,660
I was not happy about that.

34
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,580
I know you misunderstood.

35
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,510
I asked him to be my teacher

36
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,540
because I wanted to learn how to cook for you.

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Just let me know when you have something on your mind in the future, okay?

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,120
I just thought you're from the same place, and you have a lot in common.

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,390
And he can cook.

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,160
What if...

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,160
What if we got together? Then

42
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,079
it would be convenient for me to go back to Jichuan, right?

43
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,700
If you think that way, I have nothing to say.

44
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,760
I didn't mean that.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,650
What can I say?

46
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,840
I just want to go home with you.

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
Xiao Yang and I are just from the same place.

48
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,370
He is good friends with Prince Han.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,360
Shouldn't we take care of him

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,290
as his brother and sister-in-law?

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

52
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,180
How would I know that our handsome and smart Prince Zheng

53
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,150
can be jealous?

54
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,430
I like you.

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,020
I only like you.

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,950
I like you the most.

57
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,370
What's wrong?

58
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,140
You can't handle it without drinking?

59
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,810

♫As far as the eye can see, it's just a regular sight♫

♫Why am I being absent-minded? And why am I hesitating?♫

82
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,620
Since Prince An took over the Ministry of Revenue,

83
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,200
he's been working hard day and night without slacking off.

84
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,840
The new currency has been effectively promoted in the nine regions.

85
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,900
So I specially recorded it.

86
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,430
Please take a look, My Lord.

87
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,100
Prince Jun also worked hard and coordinated with all parties

88
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,410
to make that happen.

89
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,900
My Lord,

90
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,240
when the Ministry of Revenue was promoting our new currency in other regions,

91
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,220
they haven't borrowed any manpower from other ministries for a long time.

92
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,560
The two princes are really good at management.

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,300
I also think

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,380
the two princes coordinated well.

95
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,980
It's a blessing to Xinchuan.

96
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,600
I agree.

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,030
Very good.

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,040
But you still have to work hard in the future.

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,330
Don't slack off.

100
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,470
Yes, My Lord.

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,690
I'll follow Prince An

102
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,890
and try my best to serve our region.

103
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,720
Prince Jun is good at winning people's support.

104
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,260
Even those who used to work under the command of Prince Song

105
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
all take orders from him now.

106
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,500
Jun used to avoid Song's power

107
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,830
and kept a low profile.

108
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,960
The more Song disliked someone,

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,560
the kinder he was to them.

110
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,810
Those actions

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
have come in handy now.

112
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,310
Of course I know

113
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,120
your temperament, Your Highness.

114
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,210
I know you are worldly and sophisticated, yet never snobbish.

115
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,120
But in the court,

116
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,140
the snobbish ones are always more popular than the grounded ones.

117
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,120
Your Highness, don't lose the upper hand because of this.

118
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,510
A person's energy is limited.

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,960
If I spent time studying the tricks,

120
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,490
I would have neglected my studies and duties.

121
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,350
I'm not pedantic,

122
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,410
but I have made my own choice.

123
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,190
However, the outcome is a foregone conclusion.

124
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,390
The one who should win

125
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,770
will win in the end.

126
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,830
I know this place.

127
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,050
I won't get it wrong again.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,980
Ten miles ahead

129
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,380
is the gate of Ming'an County.

130
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,120
Let's

131
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,060
part here.

132
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,790
Take care.

133
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,570
Yin Qi.

134
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,000
Actually,

135
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,810
if you...

136
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,940
Be careful.

137
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,250
Are you dead?

138
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,650
Are you okay?

139
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,980
How are you?

140
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
Your hand is injured.

141
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,660
Are you hurt anywhere else?

142
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,000
No.

143
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,700
Are you hurt anywhere else?

144
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,280
You head is injured.

145
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,560
You didn't feel it?

146
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,090
I'm fine.

147
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,940
My head is as hard as iron.

148
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,900
Are you okay?

149
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,420
Do you feel unwell anywhere else?

150
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,480
It's all my fault.

152
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,690
I've always been a burden to you.

153
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,260
I'm so useless.

154
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,090
I won't follow you anymore.

155
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,740
Really?

156
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:49,900
Are you sure?

157
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,270
I'm scared.

158
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,090
I felt scared

159
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,240
when you rolled down the hill just now.

160
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,790
I was scared if

161
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,040
you really fell to death,

162
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,740
or got seriously injured.

163
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,300
What should I do?

164
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,920
Anyway, I can't be too good in this world alone.

165
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,780
I have to have some flaws.

166
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,090
You know nothing.

167
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,230
Without me,

168
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,970
how should you live?

169
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,410
Just follow me.

170
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,720
You're right.

171
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,060
What's that against my chest?

172
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,560
The candies you gave me.

173
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,400
It's sweet.

174
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,390
It seems that

175
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,600
the agricultural tax reduction in the nine regions

176
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,660
has been carefully planned by Prince An and Prince Jun.

177
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,870
Yes.

178
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,790
I think

179
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,400
you have been aware of the people's condition

180
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
and had this plan long ago, My Lord.

181
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,560
It's just that different regions have different conditions.

182
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,180
It's hard to promote a universal law.

183
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,440
That's why it has never been carried out in such a long time.

184
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,280
My Lord.

185
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,590
Prince An reminded me that

186
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,340
we can negotiate with the Ministry of Agriculture of each region first.

187
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,590
We'll draft a document first

188
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,350
and they can give us suggestions

189
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,880
on the revision of details.

190
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,570
This way, we can perfect it.

191
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,120
I've done it.

192
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,410
Apart from Jinchuan and Danchuan,

193
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,020
the other six regions have all replied.

194
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,300
It's indeed a good way.

195
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,680
But

196
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,800
why did the Ministry of Revenue take charge of

197
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,230
negotiating with the Ministry of Agriculture of other regions?

198
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,480
My Lord.

199
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,890
This should have been our duty in the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

200
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,820
But Prince Jun thought of it first,

201
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,460
and it was benevolent of him

202
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,480
to spare my men the hardships of travel.

203
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,350
To return the favor,

204
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,200
the Nine Regions Affairs Division also has a proposal

205
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,800
for the Ministry of Revenue.

206
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,790
Since we've reduced the agricultural tax, our treasury must be suffering losses.

207
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,280
We need to maintain the balance between revenue and expenditure.

208
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,680
Prince Zheng is right.

209
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,230
I think

210
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,880
there are more and more merchants in Xinchuan

211
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,320
and their income is rising day by day.

212
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,380
We should collect some tax from them.

213
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,640
It can be levied according to the annual income of the merchants.

214
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,280
My Lord.

215
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,320
Although Xinchuan's market is open,

216
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,760
there are many merchants

217
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,960
who are only making small profits since they are new to the market.

218
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,320
If we promote the unified taxation standard,

219
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,180
they may not last until next year.

220
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,100
So I suggest

221
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,040
we can levy taxes in a rated way.

222
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,910
Those with an annual income of below 30,000 taels don't need to pay taxes.

223
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,090
Those with an annual income of above 30,000 taels

224
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,670
can be taxed according to the tiers of their income.

225
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,670
This way, it can benefit the people.

226
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,070
As long as we don't go against the rule of nature,

227
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,680
neither grain nor wood will be used up.

228
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
The Ministry of Revenue also has this plan.

229
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,200
I haven't got the chance to propose it yet.

230
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,120
Great minds think alike.

231
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,970
Prince Zheng is so thoughtful.

232
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's indeed a blessing to Xinchuan.

233
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,170
So is the Ministry of Revenue.

234
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,020
Good.

235
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,820
Since you two are so compatible,

236
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,990
I'll leave this matter to

237
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,940
both the Ministry of Revenue and the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

238
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,430
Yes.

239
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
This is so beautiful.

240
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,810
This is for you.

241
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,530
Zai.

242
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,840
Zheng, you are finally back.

243
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,810
Why are you here?

244
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,170
Your Highness.

245
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,820
Her Ladyship went to the City South to visit her relatives.

246
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,920
Prince Zai doesn't want to live in the palace alone.

247
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,050
He wanted to see you,

248
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
so I brought him here.

249
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,620
I want to live here.

250
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,940
I want to stay with my brother and sister-in-law.

251
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,800
Then stay here.

252
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,380
OK.

253
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,290
Su Shen,

254
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,600
arrange a guest room for him.

255
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,210
Okay.

256
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,790
No.

257
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,400
I don't want to sleep alone.

258
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,130
I want to live with my brother and sister-in-law.

259
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,000
How old are you?

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,330
You should sleep alone.

261
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,280
I can't sleep by myself.

262
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,130
Zheng, don't let me sleep alone.

263
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,610
You can't sleep with me even if you can't sleep by yourself.

264
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,310
Then stay with us.

265
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,900
It's time to sleep.

266
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,880
I can't sleep.

267
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,430
Can you tell me a story?

268
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,710
Kids should listen to bedtime stories.

269
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,210
When I was little, no one told me any bedtime stories.

270
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,580
Let Wei

271
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,070
tell you bedtime stories in the future then.

272
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,920
That's for the future.

273
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,880
What do you want to hear now?

274
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,970
I want to hear the story of you two.

275
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,110
How did you two meet?

276
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,010
We have to start from

277
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,609
when your sister-in-law ate my food.

278
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,710
Don't talk nonsense.

279
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,849
That's not true.

280
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,930
You can't lie.

281
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,410
We can't lie to kids.

282
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,869
Be careful what you tell him.

283
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,690
Understood.

284
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,520
Zheng, tell me.

285
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,050
It was almost two years ago.

286
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,050
I was about to have lunch.

287
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,460
I suddenly found something wrong with my food.

288
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,800
Every dish seemed like it had been eaten by rats.

289
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,540
Especially the spare ribs.

290
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,900
There were only four left.

291
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,370
Three.

292
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,010
Only three left.

293
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,920
I was wondering who ate my lunch.

294
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,970
When I went to the kitchen,

295
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,330
I found a girl sneaking around.

296
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,300
A pretty girl.

297
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,100
She lied again.

298
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,420
No I didn't.

299
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,790
Eat.

300
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,050
Wei.

301
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,300
I want to eat meat.

302
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,480
Meat?

303
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,590
It's still early in the morning. You can't digest meat.

304
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,560
How about I let the chef cook meat for you

305
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,180
for lunch?

306
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,630
No.

307
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,480
I want meat.

308
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,530
Try this.

309
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,620
This is delicious.

310
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,000
I brought it from Jichuan.

311
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,570
No.

312
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,340
I want meat.

313
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,240
Let's eat eggs, okay?

314
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,240
No.

315
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,980
Eggs are also counted as meat.

316
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,240
I don't like eggs.

317
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,620
They smell like chicken droppings.

318
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,790
Why is he

319
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,090
such a picky eater?

320
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,640
You know how hard it is to take care of a picky eater now.

321
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,640
Here, have some meat.

322
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,630
Zheng.

323
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,860
Didn't you live in the palace before?

324
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,850
Why did you suddenly move out?

325
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,690
Zheng.

326
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,940
You eat with Wei every day.

327
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,600
How come Father never eats with Mother?

328
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,850
I heard that

329
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,010
the ministers like Jun a lot recently.

330
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,420
So you can spend the whole day with me.

331
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,280
Zai.

332
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,940
Don't ask him so many questions at once.

333
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,080
He can't answer them.

334
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,760
Why?

335
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,010
Mother said Zheng is very smart.

336
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,190
Could it be

337
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,030
that he doesn't know anything?

338
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,720
He's not a little kid anymore.

339
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
If we can't handle him, send him to school.

340
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
That makes sense.

341
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,760
Kids should go to school.

342
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,240
That's right.

343
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,850
It should be better

344
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,560
where the teacher can educate and control him.

345
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,130
Yes.

346
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,560
Let's eat.

347
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,820
What is a school?

348
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,100
A good place.

349
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,250
A good place.

350
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,770
Sir.

351
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,460
Sir.

352
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,460
Your Highness.

353
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,760
You're finally here.

354
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,060
Your Highness.

355
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,380
I can't teach him anymore.

356
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,720
Prince Zai

357
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,320
has only been here for one day,

358
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,260
and he already instigated other students to skip class

359
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,240
to play with mud in the yard.

360
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,590
Look at my face.

361
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,420
And my clothes...

362
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,680
Sir.

363
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,820
I'm really sorry.

364
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,260
He did go a bit too far.

365
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,090
A bit?

366
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,170
Extremely too far.

367
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,130
How despicable.

368
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,550
Prince Zai must be strictly disciplined.

369
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,580
Otherwise,

370
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,100
I'm afraid he'll grow to be like Prince Qi.

371
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,820
If it doesn't work,

372
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,770
we can only ask Mr. Dai for help.

373
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
He seems to behave even worse

374
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,420
when he's not with us.

375
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,320
Can Mr. Dai handle it?

376
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,620
Mr. Dai has taught countless students.

377
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,740
No problem.

378
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,960
But he taught Prince Qi as well.

379
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,410
Your Highness.

380
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,010
Please find someone else.

381
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,010
Prince Zai

382
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,100
is a disaster in my teaching career.

383
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,250
When I asked him to read,

384
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,650
he doodled in the books.

385
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,360
When I taught him to play Go,

386
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,520
he used the pieces as rocks to shoot birds.

387
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,290
It's only been one night,

388
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,920
but he's already ruined my precious stuff.

389
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,900
Sorry, Sir.

390
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,670
Sorry?

391
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,380
These are all precious books, each of which only has a few copies in Xinchuan.

392
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,820
Well...

393
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,000
Song Wu's husband has some books that are the only copy.

394
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,010
I'll send them

395
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,050
to you.

396
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,410
Prince Zai is too naughty.

397
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,570
Only-copy books...

398
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,910
What does he have?

399
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,250
Quite a lot.

400
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,140
I'll take you to pick some.

401
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,800
Up to you.

402
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,880
Take whatever you want.

403
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,600
Really?

404
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:40,970
Yes.

405
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,140
I still believe

406
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,630
there is no kid you can't teach well, Sir.

407
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,290
Zai is not that naughty.

408
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,370
I want to go on the roof.

409
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,790
No.

410
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,920
Don't, Your Highness.

411
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,200
You can't go on the roof.

412
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,130
Don't follow me.

413
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,830
We have to follow you.

414
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,680
Slow down.

415
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
We can't catch up.

416
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,470
That is too precious.

417
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,530
No, Your Highness.

418
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,720
It's fine.

419
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,690
Go after him.

420
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,510
[Chengming Veranda]

421
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,300
Yesterday, I talked to Mr. Dai till midnight, begging him to come back.

422
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,680
He finally agreed to come back in a few days.

423
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,140
Does Zai never feel tired?

424
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,690
Baifu is already tired.

425
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,840
I've only taken care of the kid for a few days,

426
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,500
I already feel like I've aged.

427
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,200
I agree.

428
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,650
This is someone else's child.

429
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,080
We are only taking care of him for a few days.

430
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,030
What if it's our child?

431
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,030
When we have kids,

432
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
I'll be in charge.

433
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,770
Are you serious?

434
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,380
OK.

435
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,050
Write it down

436
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,850
and sign it.

437
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,470
That's not necessary.

438
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,880
Where's Baifu?

439
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,980
I haven't seen it in a while. I miss it.

440
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,720
I guess it misses you too.

441
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,550
Here.

442
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,560
Zheng. Li Wei.

443
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,130
Why are you here?

444
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,220
Zheng asked Song Wu to find some books for him.

445
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,380
He went on a business trip,

446
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,580
so I came here myself.

447
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,530
Yin Zai.

448
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,850
Yin Zai.

449
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,720
Put it down.

450
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,040
Who told you to tie it up?

451
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,930
How painful it is.

452
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,860
Give me the rope.

453
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,800
Give it to me.

454
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,520
Give it to me.

455
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,250
Give it to me.

456
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,960
Baifu, do you feel bad?

457
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,710
You feel bad, right?

458
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,350
Right?

459
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,160
Where did you find this embroidered ball?

460
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,200
None of your business.

461
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,120
This was my favorite embroidered ball when I was little.

462
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
Look what you did to it.

463
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,810
It's broken.

464
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,290
Make it up to me.

465
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:00,750
No.

466
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,570
You...

467
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,680
If you dare to

468
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,720
touch what I left in the mansion again,

469
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,260
I...

470
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,570
I...

471
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,100
I'll hit you.

472
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,370
I'll touch.

473
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,240
I'll touch it.

474
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,620
Say it again.

475
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,570
I'll touch it.

476
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,510
Stand there!

477
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,290
Stop!

478
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,140
I'll hit you.

479
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,840
I'll touch it.

480
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,470
You really don't listen to me.

481
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,800
You've really grown up.

482
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,200
How dare you!

483
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,280
How dare you hit me?

484
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,640
No.

485
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,520
No.

486
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,600
Why are they fighting?

487
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,570
Miss Song.

488
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,400
Zai.

489
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,190
It hurts.

490
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,450
Don't stop me.

491
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,030
Stop fighting!

492
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,750
So powerful.

493
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,900
Although Zai is naughty,

494
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,420
why do you have to get even with him?

495
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,480
Yin Zheng said

496
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,400
you moved into his palace

497
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,760
because of Zai too.

498
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,780
Did something happen?

499
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,300
It's nothing.

500
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,600
It was all in my childhood.

501
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,250
After I was adopted by Madam He,

502
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,240
a few years later,

503
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,450
Zai was born.

504
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,840
Since then,

505
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,930
I've been worried

506
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,020
that Madam He would no longer like me.

507
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,670
A few years later,

508
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,230
Zai grew up a little.

509
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,560
He always bragged in front of me,

510
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,560
saying how well Madam He treated him.

511
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,090
Saying she bought everything for him.

512
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,380
I...

513
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,530
I was annoyed.

514
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,470
So I found an excuse and moved

515
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,850
to live with Zheng.

516
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,890
Have you ever thought that

517
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,300
Zai was also afraid that Madam He liked you more

518
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,020
than him?

519
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,680
Wild grapes bloom.

520
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,130
Wild grapes bloom.

521
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,940
On the river front.

522
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,010
On the river front.

523
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,910
I left home long ago.

524
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,760
I left home long ago.

525
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,770
Calling a stranger "Brother."

526
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,500
Calling a stranger "Brother."

527
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:12,660
Well.

528
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,880
Let me ask you.

529
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,810
Why don't you like Song Wu?

530
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,620
Tell me.

531
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,870
If it makes sense, I'll side with you.

532
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,530
Mother has always liked her more since we were little.

533
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,660
She doesn't like me.

534
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,400
Mother always praises her in front of me, not me.

535
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,090
She always brags in front of me that

536
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,810
she can do everything well.

537
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,080
That's why I don't like her.

538
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,990
But Song Wu also did that because

539
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,120
she wanted to let Mother care about her,

540
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,390
just like you.

541
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,420
Do you understand?

542
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,730
Song Wu always

543
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,010
thinks about you when she has something nice to eat or play with.

544
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,480
But you still want to fight with her.

545
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,680
It's not good, right?

546
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,470
Next time you see her,

547
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,380
apologize to her, okay?

548
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,920
That's right.

549
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,660
Zheng.

550
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,440
Why did you always ignore me before?

551
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,110
Did you also think that mother favors me,

552
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,000
so you didn't like me?

553
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,060
No.

554
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,580
I've always liked you.

555
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,390
Really?

556
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:21,920
Yes.

557
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:24,990
Smile.

558
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,720
Come on.

559
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,550
Read the poem I taught you just now.

560
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,070
Here, have some meat.

561
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,190
You won't be picky now, will you?

562
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,660
The dishes seem different today.

563
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,730
It was Xiao Yang.

564
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,500
He knew Prince Zai is here,

565
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,580
so he made some dishes that kids like.

566
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,060
Here, see if you like them.

567
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,130
Thank you, sister-in-law.

568
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Call me Miss Dong.

569
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,130
Miss Dong.

570
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,170
Eat.

571
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,380
Delicious.

572
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,160
It's better than the dishes in the palace.

573
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,060
Xiao Yang is quite good.

574
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,870
It seems that if our future kid is a picky eater,

575
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,080
we don't need to worry.

576
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,360
If he's a picky eater, he must get it from you.

577
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,490
If he's more like me, he won't be picky.

578
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,120
Sister-in-law.

579
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,790
Whose seat is this?

580
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,770
Come in.

581
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,520
Why is she here?

582
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,050
I told her to come.

583
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,580
There are so many dishes.

584
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,980
We can't finish them all.

585
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,570
Sit.

586
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,420
You are the one who always showed off

587
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,450
the new toys Madam He bought for you.

588
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,210
Why did I hear that...

589
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:09,980
That...

590
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,320
You said I always showed off in front of you?

591
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,760
You are the one who's always been bragging that

592
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,690
Mother praised you for being obedient and sensible.

593
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,160
I showed you the toys

594
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,860
because I wanted you to play them with me.

595
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:22,810
Really?

596
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,710
I'm a dog if I lied to you.

597
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,600
There's this one time

598
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,550
when you fell down while running.

599
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,350
Why did you tell Madam He that

600
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,220
I pushed you?

601
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,300
That's because on that day,

602
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,960
Mother had promised

603
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,360
to spend time with me,

604
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,760
but you asked Mother to teach you how to arrange flowers.

605
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,730
So Mother didn't spend time with me.

606
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,010
I...

607
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,180
I didn't know that.

608
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,090
I didn't mean it.

609
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,220
Zai.

610
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,190
What should a man do?

611
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,040
Admit my mistake and take the punishment.

612
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,840
Stand straight when I'm beaten.

613
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,810
Song Wu, I was wrong.

614
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,160
Let's make up.

615
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:07,790
Zai.

616
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,170
I forgive you.

617
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,370
More like I forgive you.

618
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,290
Here.

619
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,020
Eat more.

620
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,040
What's wrong?

621
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,080
You're being picky again.

622
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,770
I just want you to eat it.

623
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,560
You two, don't bicker anymore.

624
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,160
Mother.

625
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,130
You're back.

626
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,890
You're all here.

627
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,560
Have a seat.

628
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,880
How was it?

629
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,160
Did you have fun?

630
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,340
Zheng and Wei helped me with my studies.

631
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,470
They took me to eat a lot of delicious food.

632
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,300
I also spent time with Song Wu.

633
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,090
You spent time with Song Wu?

634
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,090
Thank you.

635
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,110
Sorry for the trouble.

636
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:09,990
Not at all.

637
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,910
Zai is our younger brother.

638
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,620
But we only got to know how tiring it is

639
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,470
to raise a kid after we tried it ourselves.

640
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,530
You must have been so tired, Madam He.

641
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,120
By the way,

642
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,280
ask them to cook according to the recipe,

643
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,510
[Recipe]

644
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,490
he will eat well.

645
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,890
Zheng.

646
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,750
Can I come to your place again?

647
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,290
Sure.

648
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,570
Can you tell me

649
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,730
different bedtime stories every day?

650
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,380
-Of course. -Sure.

651
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,430
Can I have candy?

652
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,090
-No. -No.

653
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,230
Why do you still want candy?

654
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,080
You've already lost your teeth. Why do you still want candy?

655
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,010
Open your mouth.

656
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,080
Isn't it gapped?

657
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,000
It'll be all gone if you eat more.

658
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,390
Mother,

659
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,650
bring Zai to my place when you have time.

660
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:48,760
Okay.

661
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,170
Okay?

662
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,910
Louder.

663
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,100
Big guy.

664
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:55,900
Okay.

665
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,090
Your Highness, My Lady.

666
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,760
Now that Zai is gone,

667
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,320
it's really a bit quiet and lonely here.

668
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,430
Since you feel lonely,

669
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,740
stay here with His Highness tonight, My Lady.

670
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,930
This way, you don't need to move back to your room.

671
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,130
Am I right, Butler Su?

672
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,340
Exactly.

673
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,980
As the saying goes, you won't wake up in the long night,

674
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,310
and you won't feel lonely when you've got company.

675
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,880
You've been reading lately?

676
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,300
Yuping.

677
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,980
Come here.

678
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,820
Look at this.

679
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,330
Is everything ready?

680
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:43,570
Yes.

681
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,250
Right?

682
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
It's a little damaged.

683
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,180
Let's fix it.

684
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:46,890
Okay.

685
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,640
Be careful.

686
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,710
Fix this.

687
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,240
I'm not used to this,

688
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
without him sleeping in the middle.

689
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,150
It's been hard for you,

690
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,960
keeping the kid company these days.

691
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,719
You too.

692
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,120
You didn't sleep well, did you?

693
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,300
Yes.

694
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,320
It's more tiring than office work.

695
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,790
I'm really tired.

696
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,889
But we can't sleep like this, right?

697
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,300
You have to report your work tomorrow.

698
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,810
Let's sleep.

699
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,340
Yin Zheng.

700
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,570
I'm not ready yet.

701
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,100
I'm cold.

702
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Don't be nervous.

703
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,050
This matter

704
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,710
is up to you.

705
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,200
Thank you.

706
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,500
Go to sleep.

707
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,080
Be careful.

708
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,940
Come here. Yes.

709
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,010
Hang it up and stretch it.

710
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:15,770
Stretch it.

711
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,360
Yes.

712
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,250
Go over there.

713
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,100
Yes.

714
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,680
That's great.

715
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,110
Yuzhan.

716
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,520
Butler Su, Happy New Year.

717
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,740
Come on and take a look.

718
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,760
I'll make it up if anything's missing.

719
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,820
Nothing's missing.

720
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,420
All right.

721
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,620
Have you even looked at it? Saying nothing's missing.

722
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,730
Stretch it.

723
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,950
Be careful.

724
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,210
Don't fall.

725
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,800
Yes.

726
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,730
Stretch it.

727
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,730
Make it flat.

728
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,370
Boss.

729
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,080
Line up.

730
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,400
Everyone,

731
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,720
this is the first New Year's Eve dinner in our restaurant.

732
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,960
We are counting on this

733
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,890
to make our name.

734
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,590
Record the number of people

735
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,070
and the eating habits of each table reserved.

736
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,130
Prepare the ingredients in advance.

737
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,570
If you make a mistake,

738
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,300
you will be punished.

739
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,110
But if you do it well,

740
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,760
you will be rewarded.

741
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,210
Thank you, Boss.

742
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,510
Thank you all.

743
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,390
Go back to work.

744
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,660
Don't worry, Boss.

745
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,720
I've followed your order and told them what to do.

746
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,250
And I'm here watching them.

747
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,180
They dare not make any mistakes.

748
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,080
Thank you.

749
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,740
I heard you talking up there.

750
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,640
I thought Yuan Ying is back.

751
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,550
Wei, you are really

752
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,140
getting more and more like a boss.

753
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,880
I've prepared the new year gift for Yuan Ying.

754
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,080
I wonder how far away Shangguan is from us.

755
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,920
I've saved her dividends for her.

756
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,320
Let's wait for her reply.

757
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,010
It's been a long time.

758
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,010
I've missed them.

759
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,320
It's winter.

760
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,320
I prepared some thick clothes for Shangguan.

761
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,380
She must like them.

762
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,100
You're the most considerate one now.

763
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,360
According to Xinchuan's tax reduction plan,

764
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,160
first, the agricultural tax has been changed

765
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,840
from being collected according to the number of people

766
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,970
to being collected according to the land size and asset.

767
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,960
From being collected throughout the four seasons,

768
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,610
to being collected only in summer and autumn.

769
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,590
The elderly, weak and disabled,

770
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,120
and those who have lost their partners can enjoy tax exemption.

771
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,160
Second, for merchants,

772
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,000
the tax will be collected in a rated way.

773
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,920
For those who make under 30,000 taels per season,

774
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,180
there will be no taxes.

775
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,200
Have you been listening to

776
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,880
what I said?

777
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:49,910
Yes.

778
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,370
I've been listening.

779
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,580
What did I say?

780
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,690
Repeat it.

781
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,050
That is...

782
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,960
You need to think about what needs to be done at your post.

783
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,360
How can you not care about

784
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,090
such an important thing like tax reduction?

785
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,230
Sis, I'm begging you.

786
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,140
Well...

787
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,370
It's New Year.

788
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,430
Everyone is on holiday.

789
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,510
Can't we take a break

790
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,710
and think about this after the New Year?

791
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,150
I'll read it.

792
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:20,940
I'll read it, okay?

793
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,340
I will.

794
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,230
I can tell if

795
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,700
you are trying to get it over with.

796
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,730
Your Highness.

797
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,730
The New Year's goods sent from Xinchuan have arrived.

798
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,310
I'll take a look.

799
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,540
[Siyuan Inn]

800
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,040
[Good friends Gathering Here]

801
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,600
This inn looks fine.

802
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,980
Why don't we stay here for a night?

803
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:55,920
Forget it.

804
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,120
We should save money.

805
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,620
Let's find a place to camp.

806
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,080
It's Spring Festival. I want you to live in a better place.

807
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,460
Alright.

808
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,400
It's settled then.

809
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,130
Listen to me.

810
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,820
Waiter.

811
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,020
Coming.

812
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,430
Here.

813
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,800
Please enjoy.

814
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,970
You even bought hot pot?

815
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,540
It's Spring Festival.

816
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,900
We should at least have a good meal.

817
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,360
Come on.

818
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,680
And your favorite chili.

819
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,620
It tastes good.

820
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,510
We'll arrive in Cangchuan

821
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,430
in a few days.

822
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,050
Even speaking of it makes me angry.

823
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,270
We've been traveling for days.

824
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,780
We only saw a few ruffians

825
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,640
when we first got out of Danchuan.

826
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,110
After that, we didn't even see

827
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,310
a bandit or gangster.

828
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,010
I have nowhere to use my spear.

829
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,770
That's a good thing.

830
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,320
It means the world is peaceful.

831
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,810
Our people live and work in peace.

832
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,210
Right?

833
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,700
-Makes sense. -Right.

834
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,390
Here.

835
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,980
This is for you.

836
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,010
It's snowing.

837
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,500
It really is.

838
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,290
So pretty.

839
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:35,820
Yes, it is.

840
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,600
It's nice.

841
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,240
Didn't you always want to see snow?

842
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,040
Now you see it.

843
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,720
But

844
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,060
this winter is particularly cold.

845
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,260
It's such a rare cold winter.

846
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,380
It must be hard for the people.

847
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:56,770
Wait a moment.

848
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,630
Are you still cold?

849
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,450
If you have something to say, go ahead.

850
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,450
Shangguan,

851
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,810
I want to tell you...

852
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,460
Guess what they are doing now.

853
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,530
I don't know.

854
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:48,950
You don't know?

855
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,020
Let me tell you.

856
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,930
My father must be...

857
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,530
Yin Zai.

858
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,700
Come here.

859
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,080
Recite the new poems you learned this year.

860
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,150
Let's see what you've learned this year.

861
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,610
Wild grapes bloom

862
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,370
on the river front.

863
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,850
I left home long ago.

864
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,630
Calling a stranger "Brother."

865
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,070
Good.

866
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,560
What about your mother, Madam Chun?

867
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,280
My mother?

868
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,240
My mother must be urging people to have kids.

869
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,280
No matter who she meets,

870
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,440
she will definitely say...

871
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,050
Yan.

872
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:28,070
You've been married for a while.

873
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,300
Why isn't there any good news?

874
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,900
You have to try harder.

875
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,740
Yes.

876
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,500
But after you have a child,

877
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,120
you need to educate him or her well.

878
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,620
Don't slack off.

879
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,280
Don't let him be a matrilocal husband like Qi.

880
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,640
Shangguan.

881
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,970
Your sister said you used to like smiling.

882
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,370
I haven't seen you smile a lot in Xinchuan.

883
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,090
I thought she lied to me.

884
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,040
But maybe it's because

885
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,100
you were not happy.

886
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,920
But it's okay.

887
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,470
I can make you happy now.

888
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,330
Actually,

889
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,180
you know that's not what I wanted to tell you.

890
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,310
I didn't want to ask you what everyone is doing.

891
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,370
I wanted to tell you

892
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,320
that...

893
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,370
Go ahead.

894
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,290
Shangguan.

895
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,710
We've been

896
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,780
to many places these days.

897
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,790
I really like this kind of life.

898
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,200
As long as I can be with you,

899
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,720
no matter where I go,

900
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,680
no matter what I do,

901
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,990
I'm very happy.

902
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,500
I sleep happily every day

903
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,190
and get up happily.

904
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,340
There is a word that describes

905
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,210
a person who's very satisfied.

906
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,670
What was the saying again?

907
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,600
Laugh, and grow fatty.

908
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,860
I've indeed gained some weight recently.

909
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,290
♫The weather is cool, the clouds are light♫

910
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,280
But that word

911
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,330
should be "fat", right?

912
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,920
It's okay.

913
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,510
♫Flowing waters greet people♫

914
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,240
The way you said it is also right.

915
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,700
As long as I can be with you,

916
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,640
from now on,

917
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,430
I'll just "laugh, and grow fatty".

918
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,550
♫In the breeze♫

919
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,540
Shangguan.

920
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,850
I've made up my mind.

921
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,340
♫Your gentle smile♫

922
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,070
I only want you

923
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,720
♫It is remembered in my heart♫

924
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,440
in my life.

925
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,130
I'm attached to you.

926
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,500
♫Taking out the spear in the wind♫

927
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,810
You can't drive me away even if you kill me.

928
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,860
♫Weapons run out, time passes♫

929
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,960
I can't drive you away even if I kill you?

930
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,320
But don't kill me for real.

931
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,910
Give me a chance to survive.

932
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,130
♫Everything goes with the wind♫

933
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,780
♫As I remember you♫

934
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,600
You're smiling.

935
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,400
Are you happy?

936
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,720
So are you saying yes?

937
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,460
♫I will have a nice day♫

938
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,020
Yeah!

939
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,640
♫My life is related with you♫

940
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:49,090
♫The chance meeting made me fall in love at first sight♫

941
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,130
♫So many rains and winds♫

942
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,600
♫Wet the footprints♫

943
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:00,360
♫You're the reason why I'm here♫

944
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:05,960
♫Mountains and rivers stretch for thousands of miles because of you♫

945
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,500
♫We enjoy at the grassy grass at the pavilion♫

946
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,950
♫My love♫

947
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:17,270
♫Won't change♫

948
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:25,570
♫Even if it's the edge of the sky and the rim of the sea, I will wait for you♫

949
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,820
♫Taking out the spear in the wind♫

950
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,430
♫Weapons run out, time passes♫

951
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,990
♫Everything goes with the wind♫

952
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,780
♫As I remember you♫

953
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,520
♫I will have a nice day♫

954
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:12,430
♫I'll give you the rest of my life and we'll be together♫

955
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,320
♫We have fallen in love with each other as time goes♫

956
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,640
♫So many rains and winds♫

957
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,100
♫Wet the footprints♫

958
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:29,660
♫You're the reason I'm here♫

959
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,660
♫The scenery is endless because of you♫

960
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,890
♫Spring rain covers all the islands and pavilions♫

961
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,890
♫In this eternal world♫

962
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,430
♫Together with you♫

963
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,920
♫May we spend days and nights together♫

964
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,020
♫All the past is closely related to you♫

965
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:03,390
♫The ordinary moments all remind me of♫

966
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,220
♫The scenery we haven't seen♫

967
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,490
♫Inviting you♫

968
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,380
♫To join me♫

969
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,420
♫In every journey around the world♫
