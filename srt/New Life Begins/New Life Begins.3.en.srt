[Episode 03]

4
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,420
Somehow,

5
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,240
she thought the day of the Exam will be your death.

6
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,120
She is just counting the days and waiting for you to die.

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,160
In that case, she can be a widow,

8
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,039
receiving the pension

9
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,680
and having fun in Jichuan.

10
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,640
Your Highness,

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,039
she used to flatter you,

12
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,580
so I thought she liked you.

13
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,280
But she doesn't treat you sincerely.

14
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,990
She just wants to go back to her hometown

15
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,789
and be a widow.

16
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,330
Her kindness to you

17
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,560
was out of hospice care.

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,520
She never really cared about you.

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,960
I'm so angry.

20
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,870
How about this?

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,580
Let's... Let's detain her now.

22
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,240
Right here.

25
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,950
Forget it.

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,900
Let her be.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,400
But...

28
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,120
Leave it after the Exam.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,010
Well, you...

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,000
But she...

31
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,990
You may leave.

32
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,470

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,030

You don't have any sense of music.

48

54
00:03:59,090 --> 00:03:59,420
Okay.

Please go and get ready.

no matter how bad or how well he did,

70
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,250
make some good dishes

71
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,220

72
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,980
Of course.

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,810
what's the point that Mr. Dai mentioned last time?

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,870
Why can't I find it?

76
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,810
This sentence.

77
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,590
That's all?

78
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,080
And this one.

79
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,290
Qi,

80
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,060
what did father say?

81
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,400
Can you be the last for us this time?

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,460
How will father punish you this time?

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,600
I'll try my best.

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,280
I'll try my best to be the last.

85
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,830
Go.

86
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,050
Go.

87
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,820
Go get ready.

88
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,690
Hurry up.

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,470
Summon the Sixth Prince to come in for the Exam.

90
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,260
My Lord.

91
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,710
The Exam begins.

92
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,620
Your Highness, you chose the question

93
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,770
about reducing taxes

94
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,480
but you didn't discuss the taxes of various regions one by one.

95
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,170
You only mentioned Mochuan, Danchuan and Jinchuan.

96
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,540
May you state the justification?

97
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Because only these three are in the same size as Xinchuan,

98
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,490
making them suitable for comparing,

99
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,950
especially the special situation of Mochuan.

100
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,800
Mochuan is guarding the Xinchuan Pass.

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,450
Xinchuan is guarding the back of Mochuan.

102
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,030
If Xinchuan wants to reduce agricultural taxes, the official has to take Mochuan into consideration.

103
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,760
So I mainly discussed the tax reducing policy of them

104
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,490
in the article,

105
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,080
hoping there's something worth learning.

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,590
Jinchuan values business.

107
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,320
Xinchuan values agriculture.

108
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,790
How can they be compared?

109
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,970
It's ture that the cities and markets in Xinchuan are quite standard.

110
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,680
But if people want to do business in the future,

111
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,580
it's better to set the rules beforehand

112
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,820
than to do it later.

113
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,060
The mining industry of Daichuan

114
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,140
is also very important to us.

115
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,770
Why didn't you mention that aspect?

116
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,750
Daichuan is special.

117
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,890
Even if Lord Daichuan wants to reduce taxes,

118
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,750
he has to discuss with the owners of the mines.

119
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,760
But the policy making is not constrained by anyone in Xinchuan.

120
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,820
So there's no need to learn from them.

121
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,920
My Lord.

122
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,260
Then there will be no question.

123
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,680
Wait.

124
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,780
Dai Di has served me the article.

125
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,060
You intend to cancel those rigorous and heavy taxes

126
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,420
and only levy taxes in summer and autumn.

127
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,630
Besides, you intend to levy according to the working population in every household.

128
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,900
As for the elderly, the weak, the sick, the disabled,

129
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,260
widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless, you want to exempt their taxes.

130
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,770
You are daring.

131
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,210
Those people are unable to work

132
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,070
so we should not levy taxes on them.

133
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,340
In spring, people need to buy seeds for planting

134
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,870
so they have no spare money.

135
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,220
In winter, they stop farming and need money to celebrate the Spring Festival.

136
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,950
Therefore, only summer and autumn are suitable for levying taxes.

137
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,250
The Exam is over.

138
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,190
Prince did so well.

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,900
He's a genius at studying.

140
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,600
Your Ladyship.

141
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,130
What... What are you doing?

142
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,840
Take it off.

143
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,290
Why did you dress like this?

144
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,090
Take it off.

145
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,600
Today is the day of Prince's death.

146
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,640
What do you mean by death?

147
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

148
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,850
Take off the clothes.

149
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,690
You're dressed so brilliantly.

150
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,990
What if Prince sees...

151
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,630
Help!

152
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,160
Your Highness.

153
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,430
Your Ladyship.

154
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,750
Why do you have the letters?

155
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,020
I'm really sorry.

156
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,020
My stomach disease isn't enough to kill me.

157
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,640
But you said...

158
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,400
What?

159
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,670
There's only half a month left.

160
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,190
I mean there's only half a month left for the Exam.

161
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,760
Did you finish the Exam?

162
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,340
Yes.

163
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,080
How did you do?

164
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,070
I'm the top one.

165
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,990
Congratulations, Your Highness.

166
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,850
You are really wise and powerful.

167
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,900
All right, you may leave.

168
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,140
I want to talk to Concubine privately.

169
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,460
You too.

170
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,100
Oh no.

171
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
What is he going to do?

172
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,210
Do I look weak?

173
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:31,950
What?

174
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,820
Because I look weak,

175
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,900
you think I will die soon, right?

176
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,860
I want the truth.

177
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,700
People around me won't tell me the truth.

178
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,830
But I want the truth.

179
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,220
Alright.

180
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,150
You may stand up.

181
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,500
Well, I...

182
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,050
I'll tell you the truth.

183
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,980
Just go ahead.

184
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,010
You indeed to

185
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,510
look a little weak.

186
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,470
Besides, I heard that

187
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,310
you've been weak since you were young.

188
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,570
So...

189
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,280
So?

190
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,580
So it's hard for you to take the responsibility.

191
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,180
Your parents don't love you.

192
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,950
And you are the weakest among the princes.

193
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,000
And then?

194
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,800
That's all.

195
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,550
What will you do to me?

196
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,310
Just look out for yourself.

197
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,010
Dad. Mom.

198
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,290
I will die soon.

199
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,480
Flowers on the way back bloomed,

200
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,350
and my coffin will go home soon.

201
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,930
Remember to prepare the food and wine for me.

202
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,130
Don't forget the charcoal beef hotpot.

203
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,430
Your Highness.

204
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,380
Did she say any nonsense to you last night?

205
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,710
No, she told a lot of truths that you wouldn't tell.

206
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,100
I also confirmed that people really believed

207
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,990
what I wanted to show the world.

208
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,850
Your Highness,

209
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,400
how can you think like that?

210
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,430
How could I not tell you the truth?

211
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,360
I swear to God that

212
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,040
since you saved me from the cane of Prince Song,

213
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,280
I have been loyal to you.

214
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,840
God is my witness.

215
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,760
Then tell me am I weak

216
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,960
in the eyes of outsiders?

217
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,020
No. You are wise and powerful.

218
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,690
How can you be weak?

219
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,080
In my heart,

220
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,560
you are as strong as a deity.

221
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,440
You are invincible.

222
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,220
-My respect for you... -Enough.

223
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Ask Liu Baoquan to learn to cook some Jichuan cuisine.

224
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,410
And the...

225
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,040
the charcoal beef hotpot.

226
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,820
My beloved Sixth Prince,

227
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,370
I'm unforgivable.

228
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,680
Unforgivable?

229
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,110
Your Ladyship, you are back.

230
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,800
Great.

231
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,300
Prince has recovered from his gastrosia.

232
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,230
Madam Xinchuan ordered

233
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,300
that you and Prince

234
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,860
should make up the wedding festivities tonight.

235
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,790
What did you say?

236
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,530
Come on.

237
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:37,870
This...

238
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,260
Come here.

239
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,690
Who... Whose wedding?

240
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,560
Your Ladyship, since you're going to consummate with Prince tonight.

241
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
I will teach you some rules.

242
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,980
After Your Ladyship bathes tonight,

243
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,580
Prince will come to your room.

244
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,460
[Restricted]

245
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,820
Your Ladyship?

246
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,330
Do you remember

247
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,100
what Nanny said just now?

248
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,970
Your Ladyship, please take it seriously.

249
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,900
It's better for you to get Prince's favor tonight.

250
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,860
Then you two can…

251
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,020
Xinchuan people are too indifferent.

252
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,580
I'm dying.

253
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,560
But I still have to consummate with someone.

254
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,590
Your Ladyship. Don't think that way.

255
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,110
Your Ladyship.

256
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,440
Madam Xinchuan ordered

257
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,540
to make up the wedding for you and Prince.

258
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,340
That means Prince didn't take your mistakes to heart.

259
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,690
Otherwise, he would have reported to the Lord.

260
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,570
You won't die.

261
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes.

262
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,790
I won't die?

263
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,720
But I still have to consummate with him.

264
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,540
Your Ladyship.

265
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,320
Don't worry.

266
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,830
I think Prince is good.

267
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,260
I don't want to know that.

268
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,890
Think about the future.

269
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,490
It's true.

270
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,130
You're just a concubine now.

271
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,680
But Xinchuan women can only live a good life by their children.

272
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,560
If you can have a child soon,

273
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,460
you will have a place in here.

274
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,860
So you have to work hard.

275
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,460
If you don't have a baby soon,

276
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,790
you might get divorced.

277
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,100
What did you say?

278
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,290
Prince Jun had a concubine before.

279
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,870
But because she had no child,

280
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,960
she got kicked out by a divorce letter.

281
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,080
We are afraid that you would be kicked out too.

282
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,940
Got kicked out?

283
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,260
That's too bad.

284
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,860
Fine.

285
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,520
Although the bride has moved in Zheng's mansion,

286
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,990
the horseplay at the wedding

287
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,580
can't be missed.

288
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:48,880
Yes.

289
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,940
We can't miss that.

290
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,560
You're lucky

291
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,510
to marry a good, gentle and considerate girl.

292
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,810
She won't play the hand wrestling with you.

293
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,730
It's a big day.

294
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,100
Qi, don't expose your family's scandal.

295
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,770
Zheng,

296
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,400
I prepared a wedding gift for you.

297
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,600
I don't want it.

298
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,880
Take it.

299
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,040
No need. It's enough.

300
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,800
Princes,

301
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,190
it's getting late.

302
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,700
Please stop here.

303
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,400
Please take care on your way home.

304
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,260
You may go home.

305
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,020
Just go home.

306
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,760
Take it. Study hard.

307
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,160
Wish you success.

308
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,600
Bye.

309
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Please take care.

310
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,650
Why did you eat so much?

311
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,530
I accidentally ate a little more.

312
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,590
What's wrong?

313
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,850
-Your Highness. -Your Highness.

314
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,150
Concubine is not available today.

315
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,770
Not available?

316
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,830
Your Highness.

317
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,360
It's really inconvenient.

318
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,650
Your Highness.

319
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,680
I injured my face accidentally

320
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,910
so I can't see you.

321
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,260
Please forgive me.

322
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,910
Please go back first.

323
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,270
Injured your face?

324
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,760
Move!

325
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,319
I...

326
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,720
I suddenly want to eat spicy lamb.

327
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,859
I couldn't help myself

328
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,849
so I went to the kitchen to get some.

329
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,160
Nanny said

330
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,730
those with indecent faces can't see Prince.

331
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,829
It is disrespectful.

332
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,230
So,

333
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,200
please go back to

334
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,990
your room tonight.

335
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,470
I have a stomachache suddenly.

336
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,770
If Madam Xinchuan asks, just tell her...

337
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,610
Just tell her the truth.

338
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,740
Yes, Your Highness.

339
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,090
Your Highness.

340
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,140
If you want it so much,

341
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,030
you can find someone else.

342
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,560
You are so wise and powerful.

343
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,350
I'm sure you'll find someone who's willing and available.

344
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,910
Sorry that I got inflamed.

345
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,260
Don't eat lamb if you got inflamed.

346
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,030
Tell Liu Baoquan not to let her approach the kitchen.

347
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,890
Please be sure.

348
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,560
Fortunately, I don't need to consummate.

349
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,440
Your Ladyship?

350
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,270
You want to secretly eat in the kitchen again?

351
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,100
I got inflamed and want some cold water.

352
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,140
[No entry for Li]

353
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,290
Your Ladyship.

354
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,880
You got flamed because you secretly ate roasted mutton with chili yesterday.

355
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,810
According to the rules, a person with indecent appearance shouldn't meet Prince.

356
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,170
So you couldn't serve Prince.

357
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,160
If you eat something wrong again today

358
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,490
and fail to consummate,

359
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,390
then I can't work here.

360
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,500
No, I really need to eat...

361
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,570
I can't disobey Prince's order.

362
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,470
Your Ladyship, please leave.

363
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,720
Prince Zheng is really evil.

364
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,870
[Mansion of the Legitimate Eldest Prince-Jie Yuan]

365
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,690
Your Highness.

366
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,740
Why are you kneeling?

367
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,570
What?

368
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,500
Do you feel sorry for her because

369
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,750
I punished her to kneel for a while?

370
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,810
It doesn't matter.

371
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,070
Lady is teaching me the rules.

372
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,360
This morning,

373
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,260
the Lord said that Madam Xinchuan is sick.

374
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,750
Fangru,

375
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,910
pack up and go to the palace

376
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,490
to serve mother.

377
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,450
Hao Jia has a better temper than you.

378
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,510
She's more suitable to serve mother.

379
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,360
Take her with you.

380
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,070
Thank you, Your Highness.

381
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,300
If you let her go,

382
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,640
that's like a slap on my face.

383
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,490
It's hard to serve a patient.

384
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,250
She can kneel, right?

385
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,310
Just let her kneel in front of mother

386
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,110
so that you won't suffer.

387
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,990
Has Lady Fangru bullied you recently?

388
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,650
I chose the master myself.

389
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,340
Since I'm working here,

390
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,950
it's inevitable to suffer.

391
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,110
Tell me if you're really unhappy.

392
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,190
You'll get sick if you hold it in.

393
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,430
Don't worry. I'm fine.

394
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
Miss Hao is not happy?

395
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,460
Let me tell you a joke.

396
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,190
Once upon a time...

397
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,250
Stop showing off.

398
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,220
It's embarrassing.

399
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,870
It hurts.

400
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,950
What are you doing?

401
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,120
So many people here.

402
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,110
If I could be as free as Shangguan,

403
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,800
I wouldn't have to worry about the consummating.

404
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,970
You don't want to consummate?

405
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,830
So I came here to serve Madam.

406
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,230
Do you know why Madam is sick?

407
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,860
What disease is she suffering from?

408
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,760
She got too mad at the Third Prince.

409
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,960
Then she got inflamed and caught a cold.

410
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,600
The Third Prince is the most handsome

411
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,310
among all princes.

412
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,620
His birth mother is a noble lady in Jinchuan.

413
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,780
She left him a huge fortune.

414
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,350
The one

415
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,580
who is noble

416
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,450
and handsome

417
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,580
with sharp eyes?

418
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,540
Exactly.

419
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,410
The Third Prince lost his mother at a young age.

420
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,470
So Lord Xinchuan and Madam Xinhuan care about him a lot.

421
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,660
He was raised in Zhongyi Hall.

422
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,140
People in Xinchuan value the hierarchy of wife-concubine offspring.

423
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,360
Except the Third Prince,

424
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,410
the most favored ones are the Second and Tenth Prince

425
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,210
who were born of Madam Xinchuan.

426
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,670
No wonder he was raised by the Lord and the Madam.

427
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,810
He's used to be indulged.

428
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,710
That's why he's indulging himself outside the palace

429
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,570
and made Madam Xinchuan so angry.

430
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,750
But if

431
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,560
he never comes back,

432
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,130
I can keep serving in the palace.

433
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,880
It'd be better if I could live in there.

434
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,700
Wei.

435
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,010
Watch your mouth.

436
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,290
Madam Xinchuan is tired today.

437
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,060
Please leave the tonics here

438
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,630
and go back first.

439
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,890
Did you just say

440
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,230
the person who prepared this?

441
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,050
Li Wei, Concubine of the Sixth Prince.

442
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:11,910
Let her in.

443
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,800
Your Ladyship.

444
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,160
The stewed loquat with dew is great.

445
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,550
You are ingenious.

446
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,410
I'm sure you can live in harmony with Zheng.

447
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,140
Thank you for your compliment.

448
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,310
Prince Zheng and I are fine.

449
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,020
But you don't feel well.

450
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,050
Let me stay and take care of you.

451
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,900
As long as you don't let me stay with Prince,

452
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,570
I'll do anything for you.

453
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,480
You are a good girl.

454
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,540
But you don't have to take care of me.

455
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,580
Go back and take good care of Zheng.

456
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,490
Have children with him as soon as possible.

457
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,070
Bringing more children for Xinchuan Palace

458
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,770
is sharing my burden.

459
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,350
Yes, Your Ladyship.

460
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,510
No one saw Madam Xinchuan,

461
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,210
except Li Wei?

462
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,690
Yes, Your Highness.

463
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,620
That little girl

464
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,750
specially prepared loquat water

465
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,310
to please Madam Xinchuan.

466
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,940
Are you stupid?

467
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,090
She knew it's good to serve loquat water but you didn't?

468
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,280
It's just a jar of loquat water.

469
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,680
Can't our cooks make one?

470
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,040
Don't worry.

471
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,660
Before Li Wei entered the palace,

472
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,830
I told her to say some good words for us

473
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,550
so that Madam Xichuan could know

474
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,610
that Lady and I had been waiting outside for a long time.

475
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,860
That's very thoughtful of you.

476
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,750
Fortunately, Madam Xinchuan knew you've been there.

477
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,160
I can explain to my father later.

478
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,550
I'll go to your room after I finish my work tonight.

479
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,560
Yes, Your Highness.

480
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,410
34.

481
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,930
35.

482
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,890
36.

483
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,330
37.

484
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,480
38. Two more.

485
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,740
39.

486
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,280
40.

487
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,010
Okay, be careful.

488
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,080
Are you going to do push-ups right away?

489
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,530
One.

490
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,510
Two.

491
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,280
Three.

492
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,010
I thought he is a sick man.

493
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,570
I didn't expect him to be a tough man.

494
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,090
Nine.

495
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,020
Ten.

496
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,670
Eleven.

497
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,080
Wait.

498
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,750
I have to go back and block the door firmly.

499
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,750
Okay.

500
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,110
Adjust your breathing.

501
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,760
Miss Song.

502
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,980
This is Concubine's room.

503
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,440
You can't move her things.

504
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,080
What's wrong with moving something of a concubine?

505
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,400
I can move whatever I want.

506
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,440
Please come down, Miss Song.

507
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,980
Miss Song, don't...

508
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,660
You are...

509
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,620
[Madam He's adopted daughter Song Wu]

510
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,230
You are Li Wei?

511
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,050
It seems that

512
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,930
if we are in a novel,

513
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,780
she may tear me apart.

514
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,410
No.

515
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,290
I'm Yuguan.

516
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,230
Yuguan?

517
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,080
Yuzhan.

518
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:21,610
Yuping.

519
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,170
Yuguan.

520
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,580
We are all Li Wei's maids.

521
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,320
If there is nothing else,

522
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,180
I'll get going.

523
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,080
She is bullying you!

524
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,200
How can you just leave?

525
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,120
Concubine!

526
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,600
Concubine.

527
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,180
This is my favorite room.

528
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,730
Throw all your things out.

529
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,120
Throw them out!

530
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,530
Stop pulling me.

531
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,890
Miss Song, are you alright?

532
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,600
Please get up. Are you okay?

533
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,560
I'm sorry.

534
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,080
Why are you so strong?

535
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,290
I ate too much.

536
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,170
Song Wu.

537
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,510
What's wrong?

538
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,940
Li Wei pushed me.

539
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,730
Dear Zheng.

540
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,730
Dear Zheng?

541
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,700
You...

542
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,600
Dear Zheng.

543
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,040
Dear Zheng.

544
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
You must help me.

545
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,800
Li Wei...

546
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,120
Li Wei pushed me on purpose.

547
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,050
Look, she broke my sugar painting.

548
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,560
It's inappropriate for you to call me that way.

549
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,440
Maybe call me brother?

550
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,680
Look, my hand is hurt.

551
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,120
Her name is Song Wu.

552
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,970
She's an orphan of a general.

553
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,440
Prince's birth mother and Madam He

554
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,400
raised her as the adopted daughter.

555
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,370
She used to live with Madam He.

556
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,730
But she is on bad terms with the Eleventh Prince

557
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,460
so she lives here temporarily.

558
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,330
Why haven't I heard of her before?

559
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,150
She went out to play a while ago

560
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,210
and just came back.

561
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,690
I can do it myself.

562
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,280
Dear Zheng, I...

563
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,240
Why can't you talk normally?

564
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,990
I've always been like this.

565
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,680
But you didn't

566
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,360
inform me before

567
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,830
you suddenly married

568
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,700
such a beautiful concubine.

569
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,900
And she lives in my favorite room.

570
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,410
Don't you love me anymore?

571
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,120
Song Wu is my birth mother and Madam He's adopted daughter.

572
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,580
In name, she's our sister.

573
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,610
Our sister?

574
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,260
She is indeed a bit willful.

575
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,650
Please forgive her.

576
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,320
Dear Zheng, aren't you going to uphold justice for me?

577
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,960
It was Li Wei

578
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,430
who pushed me on purpose.

579
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
If you haven't messed up our room,

580
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,620
why would she push you?

581
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,600
Our room?

582
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,440
But this is my favorite room.

583
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,040
You promised me

584
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,230
to make it my study.

585
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:34,980
Who?

586
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Who promised you?

587
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,480
I like this one.

588
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,290
I like it.

589
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,280
It seems you've suffered a lot in my mansion.

590
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,720
Why don't I send you to my mother

591
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,080
and let you live with her?

592
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,140
I'll send you back.

593
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,260
Wait.

594
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,320
Since we're family,

595
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,760
we should not hurt each other over a room?

596
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Since you like it,

597
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,690
stay with me tonight.

598
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,980
Your Highness,

599
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,830
why is Concubine so enthusiastic to Miss Song?

600
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,850
Is Concubine trying to hurt her?

601
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,420
She's just afraid that I'll enter her room.

602
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,220
Just leave her alone.

603
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,750
Your two maids are called Yuping and Yuzhan?

604
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,300
Is there any problem?

605
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,780
Then my two maids will be called

606
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,300
Jin Ping and Jin Zhan.

607
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,220
Jin Ping!

608
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,940
Er Ya!

609
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,980
[Maid Er Ya]

610
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,310
What's wrong, Master?

611
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,770
Why did you came so slowly?

612
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,030
From now on, you'll be called Jin Ping

613
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,110
and the other will be called Jin Zhan.

614
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,040
Just inform her.

615
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,590
[Maid Jin Ping]

616
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,790
Yes, Master.

617
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,030
You may leave.

618
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
You can leave too.

619
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,410
Let's go to bed.

620
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,520
I won't sleep with you.

621
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,780
You sleep on the floor.

622
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,880
I...

623
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,010
Fine.

624
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,450
As long as you stay here,

625
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,770
the bed will be yours.

626
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,440
But I have been using the quilt

627
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,080
since I moved in.

628
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,510
How about I get you a silk blanket?

629
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,340
No.

630
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,630
You said yes so easily.

631
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,200
You must be up to something.

632
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
I know.

633
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,040
You must want to sleep on the floor.

634
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,320
That way, you can tell dear Zheng

635
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,330
I'm bullying you.

636
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,030
I don't want to tell anything to dear...

637
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,450
To the Sixth Prince.

638
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,920
I don't mean to tell anything.

639
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,080
How dare you call him dear Zheng?

640
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,510
How dare you call him that?

641
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,790
I've seen many people like you in the palace.

642
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,100
I can see through your plan at first sight.

643
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,310
You want to take advantage of me?

644
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,920
No way.

645
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,460
Let's sleep on the bed together.

646
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,990
Mom.

647
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,330
I'm hungry.

648
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,710
Mom.

649
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,760
I'm hungry.

650
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,200
I met Madam Xinchuan today.

651
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,450
Shut up.

652
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,940
I didn't eat much all day.

653
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,370
Behave yourself.

654
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,180
I want to sleep.

655
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,980
Seems I can't sleep tonight.

656
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,710
I'm going to explode.

657
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,220
Li Wei, get up!

658
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,620
Get up!

659
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Fatty lotus root.

660
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,500
I was wrong last night.

661
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,510
I've been on a light diet lately

662
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,980
so I was too hungry.

663
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,080
Here.

664
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,890
You didn't sleep well last night.

665
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,760
Have more now.

666
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,130
You can sleep better after eating.

667
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,800
I'll give you my room later.

668
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,620
I'll go to your room again?

669
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,040
Stop dreaming.

670
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,900
I will never sleep with you again.

671
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,360
Please.

672
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,630
As long as you stay in my room and sleep with me,

673
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,160
I'll promise you anything.

674
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,690
I find you are a strange person.

675
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,740
Why do you want me to sleep with you?

676
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,410
I am begging you.

677
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,790
Begging?

678
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,000
Fine.

679
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,500
Be my maid then.

680
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,100
My shoulder hurts because I didn't sleep well.

681
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,140
Massage fully.

682
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,390
Okay.

683
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,280
Have you eaten?

684
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:35,860
Harder.

685
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,840
You want to kill me?

686
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,200
I...

687
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,960
I was born strong.

688
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,090
I'm sorry.

689
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,310
Forget it.

690
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,250
Jin Ping.

691
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,360
This is...

692
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,480
Hairpin.

693
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:54,960
Put it on.

694
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:00,720
What are you doing?

695
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,200
I said put it on me.

696
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,719
Li Wei, did you do it on purpose?

697
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,840
You have a bump on your head.

698
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,440
What bump?

699
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,159
You just don't know how to put it on.

700
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,239
You're so stupid.

701
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,120
Let me adjust it for you.

702
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,040
Don't move.

703
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,290
[Study of Lord Xinchuan]

704
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,409
Long may you reign, My Lord.

705
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,560
How long has it been since An came to the morning meeting last time?

706
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,780
Father.

707
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,070
An's matter is indeed inappropriate.

708
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,420
As a prince, he hasn't attended court for a long time,

709
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,620
and keeps flirting with girls outside.

710
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,290
The memorials to impeach him are piled up.

711
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,150
Now mother is sick because of him.

712
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,370
I think

713
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,409
we should order him to move back to the palace.

714
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,570
If he lives with father,

715
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,080
I'm sure he will not dare not go to court.

716
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,000
This is a family matter after all.

717
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,610
It's not that serious.

718
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,160
Isn't he always under you?

719
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,890
Why don't you talk to him?

720
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,220
To be honest,

721
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,510
I've persuaded him many times.

722
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,900
But he never changes.

723
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,480
There's nothing I can do.

724
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,460
What about the forth oldest?

725
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,550
Father.

726
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,340
An has his own consideration.

727
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,350
Besides, I never dare to disobey elder brothers.

728
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,880
I'm afraid I can't take this responsibility.

729
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,220
Qi, do it for me.

730
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,640
Father.

731
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,650
Well...

732
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,630
As you all know,

733
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,210
I don't have much relationship with An.

734
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,330
He won't listen to me.

735
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,950
You may leave then.

736
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,990
Yes, My Lord.

737
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:56,810
Father,

738
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,030
I have something to say.

739
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,730
Go ahead.

740
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,140
If An can return to the palace on his own,

741
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,190
you don't need to give the order, right?

742
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,030
Come back on his own?

743
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,460
How is that possible?

744
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,230
I want to try.

745
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,600
Your Highness.

746
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,800
The carriage is ready,

747
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,600
but we couldn't find Concubine.

748
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,040
It's too hot.

749
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,680
You have been fishing for long.

750
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,200
Why don't we go back first?

751
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,910
Hold it well.

752
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,390
What if I get tanned?

753
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,420
Your Highness...

754
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,390
Dear Zheng.

755
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,270
I didn't mean it.

756
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,990
-It was because she... -Enough.

757
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,990
Don't do it again.

758
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,210
How could he do this to me for a concubine?

759
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,920
Adoptive mother said I would be his wife in the future.

760
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,950
Not really.

761
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,790
Madam He means if you can't get married,

762
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,710
Prince may marry you.

763
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Stop pretending.

764
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,470
Wake up.

765
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,180
How did you know I was pretending?

766
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,070
I didn't hold you hard just now,

767
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,530
so you must be pretending.

768
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,100
Maybe I'm light.

769
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,330
This is the first time I hang out

770
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,860
since I moved in the palace.

771
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,110
Where are we going?

772
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,110
We're going to find my third brother

773
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,370
and bring him back to the palace.

774
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,210
It will be easier if you're with me.

775
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,520
Father asked me to keep a low profile.

776
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,110
As long as you're with me,

777
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,170
people will take it as a normal visit after marriage.

778
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,730
I heard that he named all his bosom friends

779
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,390
after the 24 solar terms.

780
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,410
Does he want to gather all the solar terms?

781
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,360
I heard that

782
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,840
he named all his bosom friends

783
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,560
after the 24 solar terms.

784
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,840
Many girls are waiting to sign up.

785
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,140
Is that true?

786
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,570
I've never heard of that.

787
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,600
I also heard

788
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,480
he's noble

789
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,930
and handsome

790
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,710
with sharp eyes.

791
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,580
You will know when you get there.

792
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:44,830
Your Highness.

793
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,780
He's here.

794
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,040
So what?

795
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,530
Come with me to welcome him.

796
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,360
After all, he's your sixth brother.

797
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,250
[Lady of the Third Prince Dong Haitang]

798
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,080
We can't ignore him.

799
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:56,940
You go first.

800
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,640
I'll be there later.

801
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,020
I don't want to be too enthusiastic.

802
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:02,650
Wait.

803
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,450
Don't get too close to that girl from Jichuan

804
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,350
in case you learn something bad from her.

805
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,220
[Handsome]

806
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,410
So handsome.

807
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,020
Seems true that handsome men are narcissistic.

808
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:29,960
Zheng.

809
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,180
Long time no see.

810
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,610
Lady Haitang.

811
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,760
You're married in the blink of an eye.

812
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,460
This must be Concubine Wei.

813
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,380
What a beauty.

814
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,720
Lady Haitang.

815
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,950
You are indeed beautiful and elegant.

816
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,700
She's indeed the wife of the most handsome prince.

817
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,120
Prince An

818
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,070
must be extremely handsome.

819
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,060
Prince An's coming.

820
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,050
Sorry, everyone.

821
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,570
[The Third Prince Yin An]

822
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,560
I'm late because of some work.

823
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,050
You must be worried.

824
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,040
We just arrived.

825
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,490
My concubine has admired you for a long time.

826
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,560
On the way here,

827
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,570
she said you're

828
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,530
noble

829
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,290
and handsome

830
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,300
with sharp eyes.

831
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,560
It's accepted by all.

832
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,960
I have no choice.

833
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,690
Painter.

834
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,340
In that case,

835
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,020
I'll give you my personal portrait

836
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,380
with my signature.

837
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,110
You may keep it.

838
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,640
Thank you.

839
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,870
We don't have much time today.

840
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,400
Or I'll ask the painter to put us in the painting.

841
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,750
And hang the painting here for memory.

842
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,500
Great idea.

843
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,050
Seems she's amazed by you.

844
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,850
An.

845
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,830
Let's talk alone.

846
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:14,710
Okay.

847
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,790
Haitang, take care of Concubine Wei.

848
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,440
Zheng and I will be back soon.

849
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,400
Zheng.

850
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,860
This way please.

851
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,630
After you.

852
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,250
Throw it away if you don't like it.

853
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,940
He may seem to be friendly to you,

854
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,240
but he specifically told me

855
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,020
that Prince Song doesn't like Zheng

856
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,080
and asked me not to interact with you.

857
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,640
Well...

858
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,360
Thank you for being so frank.

859
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,480
In that case,

860
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,550
I won't make things difficult for you.

861
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,550
I may leave first.

862
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,320
I haven't finished yet.

863
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,700
That's why

864
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,600
all of us decided immediately

865
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,720
to become sisters with you.

866
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,480
All of you?

867
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,410
Come with me.

868
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,170
They are the so-called

869
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,670
solar term girls.
