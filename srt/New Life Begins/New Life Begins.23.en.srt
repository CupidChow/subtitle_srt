00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,750
I don't understand.

5
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,340
The restaurant is closed for rectification.

6
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,210
He asked us to copy the list of envoys

7
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,580
who came to dine these days.

8
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,240
This will affect the business of our restaurant.

9
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,370
What's in it for him?

10
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,130
Duke Yue

11
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,260
is not here to supervise our business.

12
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,500
It's obvious that he was ordered by Prince Song

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,830
to target Prince Zheng.

14
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,660
Duke Yue is not important.

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,530
What's important is what Prince Song wants to do.

16
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,840
It's better to stay quiet.

17
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,510
For the time being, let's put up with it.

18
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,250
Wait and see.

19
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,600
How is it?

20
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,090
If you feel angry, deal with it.

21
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,050
After all, the Legitimate Eldest Prince ordered me to supervise the restaurant.

22
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,540
There have been many foreign customers these days.

23
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,020
So many foreign customers gathered

24
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,410
in Xinchuan Restaurant.

25
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,940
That's ridiculous.

26
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,050
I'll inform the waiters.

27
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,810
After the restaurant reopens,

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,380
it will not host foreign customers anymore.

29
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,630
Duke, I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

30
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,860
The mission of this restaurant is

31
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,260
to make the foreigners who work in Xinchuan

32
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,330
feel a sense of belonging.

33
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,130
What's the point of opening this restaurant

34
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,590
if it can't host foreign customers anymore?

35
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,920
This rule shall be carried out today.

36
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,390
No more discussion.

37
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,710
Although you were ordered to supervise,

38
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,230
we are the owners of the restaurant.

39
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,260
If there's anything unreasonable,

40
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,700
we're not even allowed to say a word?

41
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,340
No.

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,560
Fine.

43
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,780
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

44
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,260

45
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,590
It's good for everyone.

46
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
There are many talents in the Ministry of Revenue.

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,310
I can send a few of them here

48
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,050
to manage this restaurant.

49
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,790
I'm afraid we can't keep silent anymore.

50
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,140
We have to find a way to deal with him now.

52
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,750

56
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,610
He hindered the operation of Nine Regions Food Collection.

57
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,870
It's difficult to record all his crimes.

58
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,640
I can't stand it anymore.

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,459
Father,

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,840
the Ministry of Revenue has indeed interfered too much.

61
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,790
I can't ignore it anymore.

62
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,750
Song sent Duke of Townships to supervise the restaurant.

63
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,560
But he really didn't do anything good.

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,770
He completely ignored the original intention of establishing Nine Regions Food Collection.

65
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,370
Please withdraw your order.

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,040
As long as Duke Yue doesn't interfere with the operation of the restaurant,

67

68

72
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,900
It sounds a bit inappropriate.

73
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,550
But it's the duty of the Ministry of Revenue

74
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,420
to supervise the restaurant.

86
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,680
it was proposed by me.

87

The circulation area may be expanded to other regions.

88
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,440
Now the Ministry of Revenue is short of hands.

89
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,240
The Nine Regions Affairs Division should step up.

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,850
However, if you are involved in the affairs of the Ministry of Revenue,

91
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,320
there will be a problem of unclear division of responsibilities.

92
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,030
If you have any ideas,

93
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,810
just report it.

94
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,490
Yes.

95

Besides,

104
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,490
your restaurant has received a lot of help from the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

105
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,290
Why did you impeach his uncle?

106
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,010
It's not appropriate.

107

Yes.

111

I'm here.

112
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,010
Good idea.

113

115
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,820

Father is our father,

but he is also the Lord.

120
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,190
He must focus on the overall situation.

Duke Yue is just an excuse.

128
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,610
Avoid being used as a gun anymore.

129
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,170
That's right, An.

130
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,950
I know you're just angry with the women who ran away from your mansion,

131
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,040
so you showed up to make trouble in front of them.

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,470
Right?

133
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,100
Stop it, An.

Don't be too childish.

135
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,900
I know.

136
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,570

142
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,720
I think

143
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,760
although Prince Zheng made a proposal about the new money,

144
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,970
he's still talking about impeachment.

145
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,330
Mind your own business.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,950

Thank you, Your Highness.

149
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,350
I know Zheng meant something.

150
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,090
But this time, Song has really crossed the line.

151
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,840
I ordered the Ministry of Finance

152
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,970
to keep an eye on it.

153
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,900
Don't cause any trouble.

154
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,750
Look at him.

155
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,160
At first, he thought Zheng

156
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,350
would use food and drinks to win over other regions.

157
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,940
Now it seems that

158
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,370
only Song thinks Zheng has this intention.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,060
I asked others to keep an eye on it too.

160
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,380
But they didn't report anything wrong.

161
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,530
During the banquet,

162
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,400
they just talked about some official affairs of the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

163
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,650
Zheng's more reliable than Song.

164
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,320
It seems that Your Highness already have a plan.

[Closed for Rectification]

166

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,220
the dishes are ready.

168
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,970
Actually, we invited you to the banquet to ask you

169
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,570
to open the restaurant as soon as possible.

170
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,860
If it remains closed,

171
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,140
we might lose old customers.

172
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,330
You're ordered by the Legitimate Eldest Prince to supervise the restaurant.

173

If a well-run restaurant was closed down

174

in your hands,

175
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,290
it's inappropriate.

This is high-class Pu'er.

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,140
Please enjoy it.

178
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,320
Actually, we have taken to heart

179

If we don't open the door,

186
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,410

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,220
In the long run,

189
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,570
it is beneficial to the people's livelihood to promote business.

190
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,730
This, I think you know.

191
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,350
Now,

192
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,040
the restaurant has been closed for days.

193
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,240
If it remains closed,

194
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,820
I don't think the Lord will be pleased.

195
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,350
It's time to open it again.

196
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,960
But I have an idea.

197
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,670
We can open after the restaurant is renovated.

198
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,230
These days,

199
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,520
you can stay home and think about the dishes.

200
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
You don't have to come here anymore.

201
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,450
Duke.

202
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,580
This is our restaurant.

203
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
Just because it's your restaurant,

204
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,800
how many customers really came to dine?

205
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,110
What a scandal it is that

206
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,430
you girls work in the restaurant?

207
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,660
Do you know how people are talking about you?

208
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,320
The messenger has a bad mouth.

209
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,630
Are you going to blame the people who are suffering?

210
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,180
Why do they keep eyes on you not others?

211
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,490
You show up in public every day.

212
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,100
All the books have been read for nothing.

213
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,290
Duke, please judge judiciously.

214
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,310
It's not that we don't know the rumours,

215
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,790
but we chose to ignore them.

216
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,000
As long as you do things,

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,830
people will definitely have opinions.

218
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,840
If we only care about what others think,

219
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,290
we won't achieve anything.

220
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,690
Even if there are rumors,

221
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,650
someone would be curious about the restaurant.

222
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,850
It's a way to attract customers.

223
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,280
Whether we can keep our customers

224
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,660
depends on our ability.

225
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,830
Qi and Zheng indulge you,

226
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,520
but I have to think about Xinchuan's reputation.

227
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,430
It's a deal.

228
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,500
Duke Yue.

229
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,990
Lord Xinchuan ordered that

230
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,550
the restaurant will no longer be supervised by the Ministry of Revenue.

231
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,640
It can be reopened.

232
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,640
It's the Lord's order.

233
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,510
Don't you know

234
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,530
what Lord Xinchuan means?

235
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,100
Whether it's the reform of the precinct-market,

236
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,940
introducing new money or letting women work for a living,

237
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,600
they're all

238
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,710
for the future of Xinchuan.

239
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,100
I know you have prejudice against women doing business.

240
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,620
But the business of the restaurant is much better

241
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,170
in their hands than before.

242
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,310
So it seems that they can also

243
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,200
do the things we can do.

244
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,070
Since the restaurant closed,

245
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,790
the Ministry of Revenue has lost 1,426 taels of tax.

246
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,120
If you goes on like this,

247
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,670
how should the precinct-market reform be carried out?

248
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,040
As the political assistant of the Nine Regions Affairs Division,

249
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,550
I can impeach you over this.

250
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,830
You're self-willed.

251
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,140
You neglected official duties.

252
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,900
How dare you!

253
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,200
How dare a junior disrespect your superior?

254
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,820
Duke, please calm down.

255
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,150
Zheng is not wrong.

256
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,600
Recently,

257
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,700
you ran wild in the name of the Ministry of Revenue.

258
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,630
Your behavior not only dragged down our two small shops,

259
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,850
but also influenced the shops of the outside merchants.

260
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,600
They're afraid that the next one

261
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,920
being incorporated is their shop.

262
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,720
That's why Father ordered you to leave them alone.

263
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,850
No problem,

264
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,560
but you have to apologize to me.

265
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,730
I know you can't even drink half a glass of wine.

266
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,770
But you should know that

267
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,780
you just offended me.

268
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,740
I was rude just now.

269
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,930
Please forgive me.

270
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,750
If you really want to propose a toast to me,

271
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,570
you should show some sincerity.

272
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,520
I'll drink on behalf of Zheng.

273
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,020
Duke Yue has a place in court.

274
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,660
He has to vent his anger.

275
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,420
Otherwise, he will find fault in us every once in a while.

276
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,860
It'll be more troublesome.

277
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,700
Zheng knows this very well.

278
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,750
But he can't...

279
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,790
Duke.

280
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,910
Prince Zheng has a stomach problem, so he can't drink.

281
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,390
You spoke to me

282
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,100
without your husband's permission.

283
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,950
I can ask the Ministry of Internal Affairs to punish you.

284
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,090
Duke Yue, please forgive us.

285
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,090
We're open for business.

286
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,300
Here's the water, Lady Wei.

287
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,370
How heartbreaking.

288
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,470
When other princes were 15 or 16 years old,

289
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,160
the Lord would bring them to meet customers.

290
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,420
They learned to drink.

291
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,540
Our prince

292
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,430
was not favored.

293
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,440
So he can't drink.

294
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,180
Lady Wei.

295
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,010
Prince Zheng knows very well.

296
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,060
He must know

297
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,800
he can't avoid the wine today.

298
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,400
It's all for you.

299
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,400
Here.

300
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,260
Change into this one.

301
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,690
I used to do all these work.

302
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,720
Now,

303
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,839
I'll leave it to you.

304
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,770
I'll go to the kitchen

305
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,700
and ask them to make some soup

306
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,230
in case the Prince needs it.

307
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,310
Thank you.

308
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,350
If you want to open a restaurant,

309
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,620
you can open it.

310
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,510
Song can bully me,

311
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,970
but I won't let him bully you.

312
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,870
I won't let him bully you.

313
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,580
Thank you.

314
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,080
From now on,

315
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,120
I will always be by your side.

316
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
Father is really out of his mind.

317
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,040
How could he indulge Zheng so much?

318
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,810
His two women are in the restaurant every day.

319
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,850
He's always there too.

320
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,600
There are so many people from other regions.

321
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,460
They said there's nothing wrong.

322
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,100
How is that possible?

323
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,180
After all, he is from the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

324
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,340
It's justifiable for him to get along with the envoys from other regions.

325
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Besides, Father has sent someone to keep an eye on him.

326
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,120
Father didn't punish him.

327
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,750
Exactly.

328
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,660
These days, I also found that

329
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,120
men sent by the Lord

330
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,330
watched him more closely than us.

331
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,200
But Zheng

332
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,750
made no mistakes.

333
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,020
Uncle pressed on at every stage.

334
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,110
It could've made them retreat.

335
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,970
But now,

336
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,530
Zheng is holding us back with the new money.

337
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,190
We can't interfere anymore.

338
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,390
Uncle,

339
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,550
please keep sending people to watch them.

340
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,860
The devil cannot hide his cloven hoof.

341
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,030
Don't worry.

342
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,850
We won't miss any details.

343
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,470
Here, An.

344
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,210
How is the meat?

345
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,000
Delicious.

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,660
Delicious?

347
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,170
It's from Cangchuan.

348
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,890
It's sent by Nine Regions Food Collection.

349
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,530
Right.

350
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,270
Haitang...

351
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,090
The former sister-in-law.

352
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,630
She always brings good food to Jing and Li Wei.

353
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,570
I've eaten this mutton

354
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,330
many times.

355
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,550
But it is indeed delicious.

356
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,260
This mutton is good.

357
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,780
It's not smelly.

358
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,840
The bones are soft.

359
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,250
Unlike Xinchuan,

360
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,770
the bones are all tough.

361
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,370
Zheng.

362
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,190
Don't you hate eating mutton?

363
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,570
Why did you start to eat it

364
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,020
after being with Li Wei?

365
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,220
He that loves the tree loves the branch.

366
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,670
The tripe is good.

367
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,760
You need to dip it with leek sauce.

368
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,850
Haitang said that.

369
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,900
I see you have leek sauce too.

370
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,270
Yes.

371
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,540
Zheng.

372
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,680
You don't eat leek sauce.

373
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,950
Why did you start to eat it

374
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,910
after being with Li Wei?

375
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,300
Didn't I tell you just now?

376
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,580
He that loves the tree loves the branch.

377
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,110
I forgot.

378
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,580
The gluten is good.

379
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,920
Jing likes glutens best.

380
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,410
Try it.

381
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,420
Haitang and Li Wei also like it.

382
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,410
Otherwise, they wouldn't have become friends.

383
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,340
They've been working hard lately.

384
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,650
Recently,

385
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,390
I've been thinking about Jing.

386
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,920
Although we usually quarrel and fight

387
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,310
when we are together,

388
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,860
as long as I apologize to her,

389
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,790
she will be happy.

390
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,550
Enough.

391
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,050
You don't want me to eat at all?

392
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,050
How long has it been since we ate together?

393
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,450
Now you're beating around the bush with me.

394
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,420
That's too much.

395
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,750
I didn't mean that, An.

396
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,860
You think too much.

397
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,220
Here.

398
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,220
Eat more.

399
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,170
Here.

400
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,450
Let's eat.

401
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,990
Anyway,

402
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,540
why has it been so long

403
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,180
since we last ate together?

404
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,270
I know.

405
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,740
Have you forgotten?

406
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,050
An has been busy competing with Nine Regions Food Collection.

407
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,940
He's busy.

408
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,010
Where are you going?

409
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,940
I'll apologize.

410
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,800
Apologize?

411
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,310
I think he just wants to talk about cooperation

412
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,470
and reflect on his mistakes.

413
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:11,800
Here.

414
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:12,870
Let's eat.

415
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,310
[Female customers are welcomed.]

416
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,320
Everyone,

417
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,080
Nine Regions Food Collection

418
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,050
has been closed for a while.

419
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,040
It's reopened today.

420
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,600
Now we're launching a tasting event.

421
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,180
We deal honestly with customers, old or young.

422
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,820
You can enjoy food from the nine regions by paying one tael of silver.

423
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,340
We welcome female customers.

424
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
The number of seats are limited.

425
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,810
Line up.

426
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,800
First come, first served.

427
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,380
Come.

428
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,210
We welcome female customers.

429
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,680
We specially prepared bird's nest

430
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,330
from Chuqiao's for the female customers.

431
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,930
Come on, line up.

432
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,890
Line up.

433
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,270
Here, this way.

434
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,160
Take the bird's nest.

435
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,890
This way.

436
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,880
Come in, please.

437
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,540
Be careful.

438
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,090
Madam,

439
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,120
the mushroom must be well-cooked.

440
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,610
Enjoy.

441
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,390
This is free.

442
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,320
Friend from Jinchuan,

443
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,170
eating while reading

444
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,440
will make your stomach ache.

445
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,050
No.

446
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,380
My classmates in Jinchuan are working hard.

447
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,420
Focus on eating first,

448
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,810
and then focus on reading.

449
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,210
It'll be more effective.

450
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,680
Enjoy.

451
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,740
Jinchuan people really work hard.

452
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,000
After persuading one,

453
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,560
there is still a group of them.

454
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,890
I can't persuade them all.

455
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,700
Look at you, talking about others.

456
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,630
You are the same.

457
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,150
It looks much better than last time.

458
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,040
The decoration is better.

459
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,500
Well...

460
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,320
The food here is so delicious.

461
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,010
Who are you?

462
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,260
Go away.

463
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,480
Why are you here?

464
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,170
Get out.

465
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:55,590
No.

466
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,050
Duke Yue has left,

467
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,570
but

468
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,770
we are still family.

469
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,210
Right?

470
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,150
I'm here

471
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,450
to learn from you

472
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,530
and talk about

473
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,690
the merger of the food collections.

474
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,950
I'm not talking to you.

475
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,670
Get out. Leave.

476
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,180
No, no, no.

477
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,780
Wait.

478
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,380
Haitang.

479
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,260
Let him in.

480
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,790
As long as he doesn't cause trouble,

481
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,020
he is a customer after all.

482
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,680
But

483
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,120
you must order food worth ten taels of silver.

484
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,990
If you can't finish, you have to pack it to go.

485
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,720
Pack it to go.

486
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,880
Just order.

487
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,300
Time for monthly payment distribution.

488
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,300
Here.

489
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,530
Thank you.

490
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,510
Haitang.

491
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:40,970
Thank you.

492
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,810
Jing.

493
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,640
Thank you.

494
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,270
This is for Ms. Yuan Ying.

495
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,020
I've given out the others' monthly payments.

496
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,400
I switched the coins and silver

497
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,460
into the new money.

498
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,650
I paid you according to your proportions of investment.

499
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,920
This new money is very good.

500
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,260
It's safe to keep it with you.

501
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,670
The business here is booming.

502
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,560
Should we open some new shops?

503
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,490
I agree.

504
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,760
Autumn Equinox and Start of Winter

505
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,690
are also from Danchuan.

506
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,850
We had a discussion.

507
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,990
We can put mahjong tables

508
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,200
in one of Danchuan's rooms,

509
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,450
and charge according to the time.

510
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,710
In the future, if there are profits,

511
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,310
we can open a mahjong parlor.

512
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,290
Not bad.

513
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,520
Autumn Equinox's uncle runs a mahjong parlor.

514
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,270
She knows how to do it.

515
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:15,820
Besides,

516
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,160
everyone likes spicy food.

517
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,830
Danchuan cuisine sells very well.

518
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,230
I think the first branch of Food Collection

519
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,870
should specialize on making Danchuan cuisine.

520
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,320
Okay.

521
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,300
Maybe

522
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,100
we can really make it into the Women's Chamber of Commerce

523
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,490
so that all Xinchuan girls can work outside.

524
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,450
Good idea.

525
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,460
The girls from Xinchuan are so miserable.

526
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,850
We should help more people like us.

527
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,320
You can't just have ideas

528
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,200
but no achievement methods.

529
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,490
When you open more shops,

530
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,390
I can't protect them all by myself.

531
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,520
Here's what I think.

532
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,010
If there are girls who want to learn martial arts,

533
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,410
I can teach them for free.

534
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,280
We'll talk about the rest later.

535
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,940
Can you teach me some basic skills first?

536
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,870
The skill in which I can defeat An with just one punch.

537
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,140
Yes, beat him.

538
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,590
Song Wu.

539
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,080
Li Wei.

540
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,850
I miss you so much.

541
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,410
I miss everyone.

542
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,540
Did you miss me?

543
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,650
Yes.

544
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,400
You're already married.

545
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,920
Why are you still like a child?

546
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,780
I have no choice.

547
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,210
Fairies like us

548
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,360
will never grow old.

549
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,020
By the way,

550
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,820
I want to ask you.

551
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,820
Can I learn to do business from you?

552
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,890
Song Wu has passed the exam.

553
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,900
Now I'm in charge of the bookshop.

554
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,190
But I don't know much.

555
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,360
Please teach me.

556
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,860
You have to ask if Ms. Yuan Ying

557
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,680
is willing to accept disciples.

558
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,590
Ms. Yuan Ying.

559
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,280
I think

560
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,530
Li Wei has graduated.

561
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,850
You can take a disciple yourself.

562
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,620
Really?

563
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,460
Then I will be Ms. Li Wei.

564
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
Yuan Ying will be your grandmaster.

565
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,870
Grandmaster?

566
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,830
What?

567
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,670
Tuition fee.

568
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,920
You hit me.

569
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,660
So, Haitang and others usually live in the restaurant

570
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,280
with the cooks.

571
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,970
When we make money,

572
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,550
we'll buy them a big house.

573
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:22,850
It's raining.

574
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,190
But there's no extra umbrella in the shop.

575
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,910
Song Wu.

576
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,890
I knew you would come.

577
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm really worried about you.

578
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,350
Why hide from us?

579
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,110
You...

580
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,760
See you.

581
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,720
Don't you think he's somehand?

582
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,860
It's handsome.

583
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,240
Let's go home.

584
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,630
Let us give you a ride.

585
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,550
No need.

586
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,000
Qi will pick me up later.

587
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
You should go now.

588
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,940
See you.

589
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,500
Let's go.

590
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,800
Shangguan.

591
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,640
Why are you here?

592
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,740
What's wrong with you?

593
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Don't mention it.

594
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,620
Tonight,

595
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,190
I waited upon father at bedtime,

596
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,330
but he scolded me again.

597
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,160
I saw that it was going to rain.

598
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,290
I couldn't wait to get a carriage.

599
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,750
So I ran here to pick you up,

600
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,690
but I fell down

601
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,880
and broke my umbrella.

602
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,380
I didn't want you to get wet,

603
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,600
but you still got wet.

604
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,160
Here.

605
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
Wipe it with this.

606
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,290
It's wet here too.

607
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,630
Stand closer. Don't get wet.

608
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:20,960
Come.

609
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:23,940
Let's go.

610
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,920
By the way,

611
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,550
we discussed today.

612
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,300
I want to do some business myself.

613
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,590
OK.

614
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,050
Do you have money?

615
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,360
You don't even ask me what business I want to do.

616
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,330
Aren't you afraid of losing money?

617
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,530
Do whatever you want.

618
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,950
I want to open a female martial club

619
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,350
and teach women how to protect themselves.

620
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,970
Are you afraid of gossip?

621
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,940
They will say you are fierce.

622
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,670
Come here.

623
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,550
Don't get wet.

624
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,710
It's just gossip.

625
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,850
I'll just do my thing.

626
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,110
Let those idiots talk.

627
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,600
Are you really not afraid?

628
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,520
I...

629
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,740
Think about it.

630
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,800
I dare to marry you.

631
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,520
What's so scary about gossip?

632
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,860
I said it wrong again.

633
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,480
Shangguan.

634
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:53,940
You

635
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,470
are older now.

636
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,200
You should be more mature.

637
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,550
Yes, Ms. Yuan Ying.

638
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,980
Give it to me.

639
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,000
Happy New Year!

640
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,170
Thank you.

641
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,080
Happy New Year!

642
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Thank you, Ms. Yuan Ying.

643
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,690
Come on, next.

644
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,550
Happy New Year.

645
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,550
Boring.

646
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,100
I can't scare Yuan Ying.

647
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,500
I can't scare you either.

648
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,270
Happy New Year.

649
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,770
Give me the red envelope.

650
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,270
Lady Wei.

651
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,330
Prince has already prepared.

652
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,260
Look at this big red envelope.

653
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,450
Then we...

654
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:03,980
Wait.

655
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,020
Here, Lady Wei.

656
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,430
Butler Su.

657
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,430
This is yours.

658
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,260
Thank you, Lady Wei.

659
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,910
This

660
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,340
is for Hao Jia.

661
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,000
And this is for

662
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,940
the baby inside Hao Jia.

663
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,790
Please send these to her.

664
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,940
Lady Wei, you're really thoughtful.

665
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,510
But...

666
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,950
This is yours.

667
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Open it later.

668
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,870
Prince,

669
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,990
Lady Wei personally made this gift for you.

670
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,640
She even went to the bookshop.

671
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,440
-She learnt for a while from Song Wu. -OK.

672
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,300
We're leaving.

673
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,150
Take care, Lady Wei.

674
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,800
Prince.

675
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,690
You can laugh if you want.

676
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,550
We're so close.

677
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,680
I won't laugh at you.

678
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,230
New shoes.

679
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,820
Let me tell you.

680
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,730
You need to wear new shoes during Chinese New Year.

681
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,850
Try them on.

682
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,620
Here.

683
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,570
What's wrong?

684
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,489
This...

685
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,360
Lady Wei is too...

686
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,300
Forget it.

687
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,380
It's safe now.

688
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,100
Come on.

689
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,630
They fit you.

690
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,010
Yes.

691
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,380
She gave me the shoes.

692
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,290
Time to unwrap the red envelopes.

693
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:37,969
Take care.

694
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,550
Lady Wei.

695
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,130
This one.

696
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,080
Who gave this to you?

697
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,880
Ms. Yuan Ying.

698
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,230
Isn't this the pendant only the legal wife can hold?

699
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,909
Princess wants to give you the inner courtyard.

700
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,840
There's a note.

701
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,240
All matters in Garden of Tranquility

702
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,340
[All matters in Garden of Tranquility will be left to you in the future.]

703
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,380
will be left to you in the future.

704
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,470
It feels heavy.

705
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,830
I think this one is heavier.

706
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,650
Unwrap.

707
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,380
Yes.

708
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,730
It's really heavy.

709
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,530
Is it a book?

710
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,460
I don't think so.

711
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,700
Such a bummer?

712
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,090
Money!

713
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,270
So much.

714
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,090
So much money.

715
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,610
He is too practical

716
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,930
and boring.

717
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,670
He is a good man.

718
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,970
He gave you cash.

719
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,190
Down to earth.

720
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,640
Let me count for you.

721
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:31,910
Let me help you.

722
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,160
Just smell it.

723
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,710
Smell it.

724
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,070
This year will be a good year.

725
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,510
It's another warm winter.

726
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,040
When can we see snow?

727
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,820
What do you think?

728
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,700
Do you like it?

729
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,280
I put the goose feathers beside the ice in the cellar,

730
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,140
so they would feel more like snow.

731
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,230
No.

732
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,650
It's okay. I'll go get it.

733
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,200
Wait.

734
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,780
Thank you.

735
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,660
Where did you get these goose feathers?

736
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,070
The Ministry of Internal Affairs sent these.

737
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,560
Li Wei and the others want to give Hao Jia gifts.

738
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,280
I thought

739
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,960
we should make some clothes for the kid.

740
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:14,970
Sure.

741
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:15,650
Okay.

742
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,290
Well.

743
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,070
Happy New Year.

744
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,290
Wish you free and unrestrained.

745
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,830
Okay, wait for me.

746
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,780
[Humble and Gentle]

747
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,570
I have no appetite.

748
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,170
Hang in there.

749
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,140
My son needs to eat too.

750
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,700
If she can't eat,

751
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,460
give her something else.

752
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,570
It's okay, Lady.

753
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,240
I love all the food the Prince gave me.

754
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,890
It's good that they opened their mansions.

755
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,400
They don't even go back to the palace for New Year's Eve dinner.

756
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,350
I had a peaceful and quiet meal

757
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,090
with my parents tonight.

758
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,690
But I neglected you.

759
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,700
When the son is born,

760
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,360
you'll be rewarded with the right to attend the New Year's Eve dinner next year.

761
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,840
It's better to let her eat alone

762
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,070
for peace.

763
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,150
Fangru.

764
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,600
I didn't scold you,

765
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,850
so you forgot how to control yourself?

766
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,260
Hao Jia is pregnant.

767
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,910
I should spend more time with her.

768
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,010
What are you talking about here?

769
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,340
Tomorrow is the first day of the year.

770
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,190
Bring Her Ladyship to the palace for New Year greetings.

771
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,590
You are not feeling well,

772
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,260
just stay home and rest.

773
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,490
Is it inappropriate not to pay New Year greetings?

774
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,430
I'm fine.

775
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,400
I can go out.

776
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,000
Why do you always think about going out?

777
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,930
How many times have I told you?

778
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,590
You should rest at home when you're pregnant.

779
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,760
Besides, Sorceress Zhang comes out tomorrow.

780
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,860
I've sent someone to invite her.

781
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,660
I'll ask her to see you tomorrow.

782
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:29,770
Yes.

783
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,800
I understand.

784
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,810
I'm full.

785
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,450
I want to go out for a walk.

786
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:34,980
Sit down.

787
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:38,810
Hao Jia.

788
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,610
Are you unhappy today?

789
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,220
You used to serve Her Ladyship to eat.

790
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,720
Let her take care of you today.

791
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,580
Prince, no need.

792
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,230
Let Her Ladyship go.

793
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,180
Really?

794
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,380
Your sisters sent something again.

795
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,380
Princess Shangguan chipped in as well this time.

796
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,460
Really?

797
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,840
Thank you.

798
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,970
This is from Princess Shangguan.

799
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,210
Is this a diaper?

800
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,260
How thoughtful.

801
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,240
By the way,

802
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,850
there's a letter from your mother.

803
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,200
Her Ladyship specially arranged it,

804
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,900
allowing you to communicate with your family.

805
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,100
You're pregnant now.

806
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,660
You must miss your family.

807
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,150
Jia,

808
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,420
[Hope this letter finds you well.]

809
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,530
When I heard that you were pregnant,

810
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,640
I was overjoyed.

811
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,350
After your husband and his wife allowed us to communicate,

812
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,230
I had the pleasure of writing to you.

813
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,740
All the words combine to this,

814
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,930
I miss you.

815
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,260
Now that we can write to each other.

816
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,730
It shows that you're favored.

817
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,970
I feel relieved.

818
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,340
Take care of yourself.

819
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,570
Good luck.

820
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,910
Looking forward to your reply.

821
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,800
What's wrong?

822
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,470
Are you unhappy to see the letter?

823
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,460
No.

824
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,490
I'm happy.

825
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,590
It's a letter from my mother.

826
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,830
Prince only cares about my baby.

827
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,000
But my mother asked me to take care of myself.

828
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,730
I'm the only daughter of my mother.

829
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,760
She is a concubine.

830
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,650
I don't know

831
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,630
how she lived at home.

832
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,510
Lady Jia.

833
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,300
Lady Jia, stop crying.

834
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,590
Crying will hurt the child.

835
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:21,960
I know.

836
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,370
But I can't control it.

837
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,250
My child.

838
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,710
He only has me.

839
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,690
But I'm useless.

840
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,820
I can't even protect myself.

841
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,760
Lady Jia.

842
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,090
You've been depressed for the past month.

843
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,060
I thought you would feel better after seeing the letter.

844
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,700
Why don't you ask Lady Wei to visit you?

845
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,260
No.

846
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,880
It's not easy for women to do business.

847
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,350
Their business just got better.

848
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,680
I can't go to them again.

849
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,480
Everyone is doing well.

850
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,060
♫Longing for softness♫

851
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,440

It's karma.

♫Gaining a moment of pleasure♫

856
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:18,740
