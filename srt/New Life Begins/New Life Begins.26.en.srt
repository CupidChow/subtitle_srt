[Episode 26]

4
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,250
Hao Jia is out of danger now.

5
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,860
But Prince Song won't let her off easy.

6
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,350
We can't let her stay there any longer.

7
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,539
Now that she has made up her mind to leave,

8
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,400
we need to plan carefully for her.

9
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,680
Song obviously wants to torture Hao Jia for the rest of her life.

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,460
He won't write a divorce letter either.

11
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,660
The key to this matter

12
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,830
is Madam Xinchuan.

13
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,670
According to the rules of the Nine Regions Selection,

14
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,880
even if Song doesn't agree,

15
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,740
as long as Madam Xinchuan issues a decree,

16
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,680
Hao Jia can still leave the mansion.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,370
But still,

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,220
I can't think of a good way

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
to persuade Madam Xinchuan.

20
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,200
Only interests can win people over.

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,600
If we want to achieve something,

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,320
we have to give up something as well.

23
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,579
There's already some rumor in the palace

24
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,610
that Hao Jia is a Helen of Troy.

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
If we use the consideration of reputation as an excuse,

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,700
I think

27
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,050
Madam Xinchuan will consider driving Hao Jia away.

28
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,070
But in this way,

29
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,360
Hao Jia's reputation will be ruined once and for all.

30
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,060
Don't worry.

31
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,720
Now,

32
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,360
she won't care about things like reputation anymore.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,890
The most important thing is

34
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,340
to live her life well.

35
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,200
Turns out it's so difficult

36
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,970
to leave justifiably.

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,820
She even has to bear the bad name of Helen of Troy.

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,130
So many officials impeached you in the court just now,

39
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,250
but I didn't even punish you.

40
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,780
How dare you

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,930
mention this to me again here?

42
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,030
May I venture to

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,560
ask you to let Hao out of the mansion, Father?

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
If Hao stays in Song's mansion any longer,

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,610
she will die.

46
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,070
Father.

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,410
You don't want others to say

48
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,720
that Song pushed Hao over the edge either, right?

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,430
Shut up!

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,610
As a prince of Xinchuan,

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,160
you broke into the palace

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,079
for a woman,

53
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,990
and went over me to look for my imperial physician.

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,970
This is a severe act of disrespect.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,380
We can't keep such a Helen of Troy any longer.

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,079
Father.

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,090
Hao didn't do anything wrong.

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,600
She just struggled to give birth to Song's child,

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
but Song mistreated her.

60
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,800
Father.

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,610
I have nothing to do with her.

62
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,600
The sun and the moon can be my witness.

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,840
Father, please, make the right judgment.

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,740
It seems that

65
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,880
not only do you not know your mistake,

66
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,940
but you think you are brave and loyal.

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Should I reward you in court

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,050
in front of the officials?

69
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,210
I did make a mistake.

70
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,200
But Father,

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,410
it's a matter of life and death.

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
Even if I have to do it again,

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,600
and even if it was someone else,

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,329
I would still do the same thing.

75
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,730
No matter how you want to punish me, Father,

76
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,589
I'll accept it.

77
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,830
But please don't implicate others.

78
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
You are still not repenting.

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,909
Guards!

80
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,550
Yes.

81
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,550
Take Prince Qi to the palace gate

82
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,970
and whip him 20 times.

83
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,430
Everyone watches.

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,320
No imperial physician is allowed to treat him.

85
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,670
Yes.

86
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,220
Thank you, gracious Father.

87
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,220
My Lord.

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,760
Prince Qi is determined not to admit his mistake this time.

89
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,280
He used to cry and ask for Madam Chun

90
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,360
when he was beaten even once.

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,460
But this time he didn't say one word.

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,850
After that,

93
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,720
let Physician Xu take a look at him.

94
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,100
Yes.

95
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,510
Such a disappointment.

96
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,590
[Humble Garden]

97
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,860
It hurts so much.

98
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,250
Yin Qi.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,970
How did it go?

100
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,790
You are here.

101
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,680
Does it still hurt?

102
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,610
I'm fine. It's just a minor injury.

103
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,970
Still saying it doesn't hurt?

104
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,240
They hit you so hard.

105
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,420
Don't worry.

106
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,410
It doesn't hurt that much.

107
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,830
Father also knows that

108
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,880
I went to Physician Xu just to save her life.

109
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,140
I had no other intention.

110
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,680
So he didn't let them beat me up real bad.

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,220
Besides,

112
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
you beat me every day.

113
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,159
I've already mastered it.

114
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,220
My skin is thick now.

115
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,950
If you don't believe me, I can come down and show you my spear skills.

116
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
If I were the one who barged into the palace,

117
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,760
you wouldn't have been beaten.

118
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,960
How can I possibly let others hit you?

119
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
I'll spear whoever dares to hit you.

120
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,090
You?

121
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,180
Who can you defeat?

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,900
Your arm will be dislocated again.

123
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,220
Yes.

124
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,320
I can't defeat them.

125
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,290
But if anyone dares to hurt you,

126
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,100
I'll kill him.

127
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,990
Let's see how many lives he has.

128
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,090
What?

129
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,850
Do you feel for me?

130
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,450
Fine.

131
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,840
If you really feel for me,

132
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,300
apply the medicine for me.

133
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,260
It won't hurt if you apply it for me.

134
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,910
Under the tailbone.

135
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,710
The tailbone?

136
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,410
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,090
I was wrong.

138
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,620
I won't hit you ever again.

139
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,010
No, you must hit me.

140
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,210
If you don't hit me, who will?

141
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,970
You only beat or scold someone you care about and love.

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,880
What did you just say?

143
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,110
I said...

144
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,690
I just want to have something extra sweet.

145
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,750
I just want to have some...

146
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,520
Sweet and sour fillet,

147
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,280
braised pork with cherries,

148
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,810
and the sweetened osmanthus lotus seed soup.

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,700
Got it.

150
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,210
Add more sugar.

151
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,450
Apply the medicine yourself.

152
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:45,840
Okay.

153
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,130
So heavy-handed.

154
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,520
Your Ladyship.

155
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Prince An is here.

156
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,300
Mother.

157
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,000
An.

158
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
What brings you here today?

159
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,080
I've been missing you, Mother.

160
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,900
I was passing by Zhongyi Hall,

161
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,280
so I came to visit you.

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,380
Have a seat.

163
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,280
You are filial.

164
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,880
It's worth it that I've looked after you

165
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,610
since your mother passed away.

166
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,960
Have you been doing well

167
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,640
working for the Legitimate Eldest Prince in the Ministry of Revenue?

168
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,040
Yes.

169
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,720
Working for Brother Song,

170
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
I've benefited a lot.

171
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:33,909
Recently,

172
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,929
Brother Song has got a new daughter.

173
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,240
Congratulations to you, Mother,

174
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,700
for getting one more lovely granddaughter.

175
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,580
Mother, have you seen her?

176
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,910
I've been busy lately.

177
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,850
I haven't had time to go.

178
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,380
Me too.

179
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,120
The affairs of the Ministry of Revenue,

180
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,420
and the family business.

181
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,680
I've been so occupied.

182
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
But I've never stopped thinking about my niece.

183
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,060
So I thought I must go and see her.

184
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,430
But I heard something strange.

185
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,520
It's said that Brother Song's concubine, Hao,

186
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,370
had postpartum depression,

187
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,550
just like Madam He did.

188
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,970
And she almost committed suicide.

189
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,970
Qi was the one who risked his life to save her.

190
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,630
Qi meant well.

191
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
But in the palace,

192
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,340
there are many rumors

193
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,200
saying that Qi is coveting his sister-in-law.

194
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,060
This is just...

195
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,230
That's Song's family matter.

196
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,090
Although I'm your mother,

197
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,700
I'm not in the position to pry.

198
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,130
Yes.

199
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,780
Mother, you're right.

200
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,160
But now both Brother Song and Qi are both under criticism.

201
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,460
If you don't intervene now,

202
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,610
I'm afraid...

203
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,640
Mother.

204
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,530
Hao is innocent,

205
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
and Xinchuan has always been benevolent.

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
We can't stop the rumors

207
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,580
by executing her.

208
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,840
In my opinion,

209
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,620
we'd better send Hao out of the mansion

210
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,260
and send her far away.

211
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,430
Once she's gone,

212
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
and give it some time,

213
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,630
people will forget about it.

214
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,350
My Lady.

215
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,000
Your Highness.

216
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,900
This is sent by Madam He.

217
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,120
Mother.

218
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,650
This is...

219
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,170
This is the hairpin I gave to her

220
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,560
when she first entered the palace.

221
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,390
Back then,

222
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,730
we were still friends.

223
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,330
Later,

224
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,690
she was favored by His Majesty

225
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,280
and had a son with him.

226
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,260
We've estranged from each other since then.

227
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,070
It's all in the past.

228
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,920
She didn't mean to give birth

229
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,120
at such a young age.

230
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,650
Not long later,

231
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,210
she got depressed

232
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,360
as if she was possessed,

233
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,450
and her temperament changed a lot.

234
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,740
She started to give everyone a hard time.

235
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,510
His Majesty stopped visiting her either.

236
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,630
I was quite happy then.

237
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,310
But later,

238
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,330
she almost committed suicide.

239
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,840
You are still worried about Madam He, My Lady.

240
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,020
Alright.

241
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,580
I'll issue an edict

242
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,170
to allow Hao to leave the mansion right away.

243
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,050
You are so wise, Mother.

244
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,650
And so kindhearted.

245
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,320
Thanks to Prince An,

246
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,280
who whispered this to Madam Xinchuan.

247
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,820
The edict has been issued.

248
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,790
You are now allowed to leave Prince Song's Mansion.

249
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,670
But

250
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,270
there are still rumors in the palace.

251
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,730
Saying that you are the one

252
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,360
who made Prince Song and Prince Qi fall out with each other.

253
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,540
It'll take some time before everyone forgets about it.

254
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
This will be implicating Prince Qi.

255
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,160
What did Shangguan say?

256
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,020
She said

257
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,180
Prince Qi doesn't care about it.

258
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,440
It's just... Your reputation...

259
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,700
My reputation is nothing.

260
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,590
People say I'm a Helen of Troy

261
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,010
and everyone avoids me.

262
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,620
But for me,

263
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,250
it's not a bad thing for now.

264
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,300
You've really changed.

265
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,370
I just said

266
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,110
what I thought out loud now.

267
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,220
I chose the wrong path before.

268
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,920
I couldn't correct it.

269
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,730
But after I almost died,

270
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,430
I came to my senses.

271
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,910
Although there are many things I can die for in this world,

272
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,840
it won't be because of a man ever again.

273
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,150
In the past,

274
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,410
I treated marriage as business,

275
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,100
and the man as my boss.

276
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,620
But why can't I be my own boss?

277
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,920
The world is so big.

278
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,190
As long as I'm willing to,

279
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,210
I can do anything.

280
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,970
I will live well

281
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,790
with Changle.

282
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,290
Wei.

283
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,110
I just don't know

284
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,570
how I can thank you.

285
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,160
You don't need to thank us.

286
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,970
You should thank yourself.

287
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,440
Thank you for being willing to choose again.

288
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,730
There's only one problem now.

289
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,920
When I leave,

290
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,330
how can I take Changle with me?

291
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,640
Don't worry.

292
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,530
We've got a plan.

293
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:45,890
Walk!

294
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,430
Come here!

295
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,400
Kneel!

296
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,440
-Kneel! -I only kneel for Heaven and Earth, but never for a mortal.

297
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,760
I...

298
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,270
Xi Yan.

299
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,390
Let me guess.

300
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,150
Your Highness and Ladyship, you asked me to come

301
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,120
for what happened in Prince Song's palace, right?

302
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,540
What?

303
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,820
You think I was lying?

304
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,110
But the child of Concubine Jia

305
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,900
is indeed a daughter.

306
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,220
You are well-informed, sorceress.

307
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,290
But if you were so accurate,

308
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,420
how did Xi Yan find you at the border of Xinchuan?

309
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,810
Were you afraid that

310
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,280
if it had been a son,

311
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,120
you would have had no way out

312
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,240
since you were not accurate about the gender of unborn children anymore?

313
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
My dear Prince An.

314
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,620
I just went home to see my children.

315
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,060
What's so fussy about it?

316
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,630
Yes.

317
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
I was afraid that you would miss your children, sorceress.

318
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,800
So we brought your whole family to Xinchuan.

319
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,820
Look at this.

320
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,770
Your son wrote it to you.

321
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,540
[Mother. We are at Longfu Inn in East City. Please come pick us up soon.]

322
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,540
[Your son, Mingzhe]

323
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,180
You...

324
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,290
What do you want?

325
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,540
Prince Song has trusted me for so many years,

326
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,070
and this is how you treat me?

327
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,800
Don't panic.

328
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,100
Don't panic.

329
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,600
We're not bad people.

330
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,590
We just want to have dinner with your family.

331
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,370
Doesn't Prince Song trust you?

332
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,010
Say a few more words to him.

333
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,720
I promise your whole family will be fed for the rest of your lives.

334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,260
OK?

335
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,130
Say something.

336
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,750
Say what?

337
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,500
Zheng has found out the truth.

338
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,960
Sorceress Zhang's family are all bad people.

339
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,760
The old cheat,

340
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,050
and the young bully men and women.

341
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,440
They tyrannize others in the countryside.

342
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,550
When dealing with such people,

343
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,720
if we threaten them a bit,

344
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,280
they would agree to anything.

345
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,540
What should we do next?

346
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,400
Will we really take care of her family for the rest of their lives?

347
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,640
I didn't say I'd "take care of" them.

348
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,800
The crime they committed

349
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,960
is enough for them to be put in prison for a lifetime.

350
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,560
Isn't that "be fed for the rest of their lives"?

351
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,329
Wait.

352
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,720
I did such good deeds.

353
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,760
You still want to go back and live in the restaurant?

354
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,970
Stay here tonight.

355
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,339
Move aside.

356
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,990
I have been practicing martial arts with Shangguan Jing.

357
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,349
If you say that again,

358
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,240
I'll break your leg.

359
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,830
[Garden of Triumph]

360
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,230
Is that true?

361
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,120
Absolutely.

362
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,890
Sorceress Zhang said it herself.

363
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,050
She read the child's fortune

364
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,160
and saw the child with her own eyes.

365
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,750
She said that the child is indeed ominous.

366
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,400
If we keep her here,

367
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,620
she may make the most important person to you

368
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,690
fall out with you, Your Highness.

369
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,090
Forget it.

370
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,800
I didn't want the child

371
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,270
in the first place.

372
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,110
When I see her,

373
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,180
I'll think of how crazy her mother was.

374
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,180
She's useless.

375
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,120
I won't keep her then.

376
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,960
Yes.

377
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,540
Madam Xinchuan said that

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,900
you seduced Qi

379
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,150
and made him offend Lord,

380
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,560
and caused discord between us.

381
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,660
That's why you can't stay.

382
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,830
She ordered you to leave the mansion and go meditate,

383
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,030
but it's all for protecting my dignity.

384
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,560
Do you understand?

385
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,540
After you leave the mansion,

386
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,190
don't gossip outside.

387
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,110
Everything from the mansion is here.

388
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,170
Can I leave now?

389
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,100
Aren't the clothes you are wearing from the mansion?

390
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,970
All the fabrics are from the mansion, right?

391
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,730
I accidentally wore the clothes you gave me.

392
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,770
Please

393
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,800
allow me to wear this slip under when I leave.

394
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,210
No.

395
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,280
Take this off too.

396
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,300
Your Highness.

397
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,960
Take it off.

398
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,570
I gave this slip to her.

399
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,280
Hao Jia.

400
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
You may leave now.

401
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,250
Thank you, My Lady.

402
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,650
Who dares?

403
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,240
I said, let her go.

404
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,120
You may all leave now.

405
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,640
I have something to say to His Highness in private.

406
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,120
Yes.

407
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,280
Zhao Fangru.

408
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,170
How dare you

409
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,980
disobey me.

410
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,150
Your Highness.

411
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,430
My father is in charge of over 20 mines in Daichuan.

412
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,530
If I sometimes disobey my husband,

413
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,390
others would ask the husband to understand.

414
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,350
Am I right?

415
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,870
You never wanted me to get pregnant with the legitimate eldest son.

416
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,770
So you could only secretly

417
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,900
put drugs in my tea.

418
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,270
You've been counting days

419
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,490
so that after you ascend the throne,

420
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,230
you can divorce me.

421
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,340
Now,

422
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,600
you and I have already shown our hand.

423
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,000
How about

424
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,350
we live in peace like this from now on?

425
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,640
After all,

426
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,270
you can't blow up my family's mine.

427
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,530
So please

428
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,770
tolerate it day by day,

429
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,010
just like me.

430
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,960
Just like this,

431
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,070
let's getting more and more sick of each other day by day.

432
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,140
I told Her Ladyship

433
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,840
that you'll go serve her.

434
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,730
Her Ladyship will protect you.

435
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,970
Prince Song won't do anything to you.

436
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,870
My Lady.

437
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,920
I want to go with you too.

438
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,570
But my indenture is in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

439
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,340
I'm leaving the mansion this time

440
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,920
because I don't want to be served by others anymore.

441
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,950
I want to

442
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,860
make a living with my own hands, just like you.

443
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,120
Now, I can't even make my own living.

444
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,030
It's bad for you if I take you with me.

445
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,670
Besides,

446
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,610
I hope you can think about

447
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,440
what you want to do in the future.

448
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,030
Understand?

449
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,320
Thanks for taking care of me for a long time.

450
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,500
If you don't mind,

451
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,300
just call me sister.

452
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,610
Sister Hao Jia.

453
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,340
Since you asked me to call you sister,

454
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,140
you're treating me as equals.

455
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,560
I can't let you leave in bare feet.

456
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,180
From now on,

457
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,320
you'll be on your own, Sister.

458
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,370
May you have a smooth journey

459
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
and be happy forever.

460
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,710
Thank you.

461
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,920
I hope everything goes well in your life too.

462
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,060
[Garden of Triumph]

463
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,640
The dishes are ready.

464
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,780
Here.

465
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,330
Hao Jia.

466
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,760
You've finally come out.

467
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,980
You have to eat a lot.

468
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,880
So many dishes.

469
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,040
Thank you so much

470
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,620
for helping me escape from that place.

471
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,390
So that I can

472
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,440
take Changle out to live with me as planned.

473
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,160
Hao Jia.

474
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,990
We are such good friends.

475
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,800
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

476
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,260
Come on.

477
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,310
Hao Jia.

478
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,660
Welcome.

479
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,430
Thank you.

480
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,000
Congratulations on finally escaping from the abyss of suffering.

481
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,930
I wish you, boundless is the sea...

482
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,680
What's that again?

483
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,320
Boundless is the sea for fish to dive at will.

484
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,780
Unlimited is the sky for birds to fly at ease.

485
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,840
Let's eat.

486
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,180
Have more.

487
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,380
So delicious.

488
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,080
Hao Jia.

489
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,090
You can stay in this restaurant in peace.

490
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,370
You can count on me for your postpartum nourishment diet.

491
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,290
I promise I'll keep you healthy.

492
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,100
How about we put out the postpartum nourishment diet in our restaurant?

493
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,710
Great.

494
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,680
We can open a store

495
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,240
where people can buy things that pregnant women and newborns need.

496
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,480
Not only things for newborns,

497
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,780
but also things pregnant women and postpartum mothers need.

498
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,320
We can use the postpartum nourishment diet and the store

499
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,200
to educate people on the basic knowledge of pregnancy,

500
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,820
and raise the awareness on postpartum depression.

501
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,160
When people take care of the newborns,

502
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,240
they'll also pay attention to postpartum mothers' feelings.

503
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,970
This way, the mother and the child can both be safe and healthy.

504
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,440
I agree.

505
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,300
Me too.

506
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,080
Everyone,

507
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,680
let's talk about the postpartum nourishment diet today.

508
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,240
Let's continue our discussion.

509
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,910
Last time we talked about the postpartum depression.

510
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,650
Actually,

511
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,850
postpartum depression

512
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,900
is very common.

513
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,210
It's not scary,

514
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,780
but we must pay enough attention to it.

515
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,970
So,

516
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,680
we need to talk about the postpartum nourishment diet.

517
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,080
Right?

518
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,680
Why are we talking about the postpartum nourishment diet?

519
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,210
Haitang.

520
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,600
Why are you here?

521
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,830
This is?

522
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,980
This is the new painter I hired.

523
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,600
Sister-in-law.

524
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,930
An hired the painter to draw some booklets

525
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,800
on how hard it is for women to give birth.

526
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,100
And they will be sent out

527
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,720
as the teacher is lecturing.

528
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,540
Really?

529
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,960
That's more like it.

530
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,500
How is it?

531
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,400
Delicious.

532
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,120
Are you used to the taste?

533
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,980
It tastes good.

534
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,340
Eat more.

535
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,400
This baby is so cute.

536
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,330
From this angle.

537
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,470
How does the pastry taste?

538
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:20,880
It's a little light.

539
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,810
Start painting.

540
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,040
Don't eat too much. The bird's nest will be served later.

541
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,840
Draw the boss.

542
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,500
You don't know who my wife is?

543
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,710
My Lady, you want to see me?

544
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,250
I heard that you've been asking someone to educate people on

545
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,160
postpartum depression in the restaurant lately.

546
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,360
Is it true?

547
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,610
[Garden of Tranquility]

548
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,130
Your Highness.

549
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,720
You're finally back.

550
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,410
Early in the morning,

551
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,800
Concubine Wei was summoned by Madam He

552
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,200
and went into the palace.

553
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,200
Did they say what this is about?

554
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,030
No.

555
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,400
Your Ladyship, please forgive us.

556
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,390
We did this

557
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,900
because after what happened to Hao Jia,

558
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,180
we realized how hard it is for women to give birth.

559
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,190
If we don't let people know how serious postpartum depression is,

560
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,550
we don't know how many more women

561
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,630
will suffer

562
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,590
like Hao Jia,

563
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,030
and can only end it with death.

564
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,970
As a woman,

565
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,170
I want to do something for others as well.

566
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,380
If one person

567
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,620
is treated better because of this,

568
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,280
it's worth it.

569
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,630
I'm not blaming you.

570
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,230
It's just this affects the reputation of Xinchuan Palace.

571
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,430
Some people already know about Hao Jia.

572
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,640
If the rumor goes wild and

573
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,180
Lord gets to know about it,

574
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,960
he will punish you.

575
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,990
We didn't think about that.

576
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,150
It's alright.

577
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,130
Since Lord hasn't heard about it,

578
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,840
I'll pretend that I don't know as well.

579
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,550
But from now on, you must be more careful.

580
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,880
If this gets out of hand,

581
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,560
I'm afraid I can't help you.

582
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,020
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

583
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,460
Help me water it.

584
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,480
Yes.

585
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,520
How is Hao Jia?

586
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,000
Much better.

587
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,120
Thank you for your concern, Madam.

588
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,850
That's good.

589
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,910
I came into the palace and begged you

590
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,990
to help Hao Jia.

591
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,530
Although you didn't agree to help,

592
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,490
you pleaded to Lord Xinchuan for us.

593
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,400
I haven't thanked you for this.

594
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,330
It wasn't all because I wanted to help you.

595
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,930
I was grieving the misfortune of my fellow beings.

596
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,090
Prince Zheng said

597
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,690
you were a little depressed

598
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,600
after you gave birth to him.

599
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,740
You didn't want to see anyone,

600
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,320
not even Prince Zheng.

601
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,670
I'm sorry I said too much.

602
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,480
Yin Zheng.

603
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,000
He knew about it?

604
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,200
He never told me.

605
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,340
Prince Zheng wanted to talk to you too.

606
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,790
But he was afraid you didn't want to see him.

607
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,350
It's me who should be sorry.

608
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,920
I was too young

609
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,050
when I was sent to the selection for no reason.

610
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,920
I had to give birth after entering the palace.

611
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,610
I was still a child myself,

612
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,250
but I had to become a mother.

613
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
I was very scared.

614
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,090
Later,

615
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,550
I saw the child I struggled so hard to give birth to

616
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,900
doesn't look like me at all.

617
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,070
And he cried all night.

618
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,230
I couldn't fall asleep.

619
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,100
I stayed up all night

620
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,440
and lost a lot of hair.

621
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,260
I felt I'd aged a lot

622
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,270
overnight.

623
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,290
I couldn't take care of myself,

624
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,590
nor could I take good care of him.

625
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,750
The more he cried,

626
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,670
the more I wanted to escape.

627
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,210
In the end,

628
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,280
I was even afraid to see him.

629
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,020
As time passed,

630
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,240
I've owed him so much.

631
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,750
I think I can understand how hard it must have been

632
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,430
for you

633
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,650
after seeing how sad Hao Jia is.

634
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,900
If a woman wants to be a mother,

635
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,970
she has to sacrifice half of herself for the child.

636
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,950
It's not easy.

637
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,670
Maybe

638
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,250
you should set yourself free.

639
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,070
Everyone in the palace says I was cold

640
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,340
and mistreated Zheng,

641
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,050
and favored the Eleventh Prince.

642
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,440
That I don't deserve to be a mother.

643
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,560
But you said I should set myself free.

644
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,170
I was just talking nonsense.

645
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,570
Don't take it seriously.

646
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,570
It's not your fault that

647
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,700
you couldn't raise Prince Zheng yourself.

648
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,950
But if you want to make up for it,

649
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,180
even if it's hard to face,

650
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,190
you shouldn't just make up for it

651
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,590
by devoting yourself to the other child.

652
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,480
The past can't be undone.

653
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,930
But the future is still ahead of us.

654
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,150
Parents and children

655
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,760
shouldn't be entangled with the past

656
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,540
and forget about the present.

657
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:18,980
Mother.

658
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,650
Why are you here?

659
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,240
Take a seat.

660
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,840
You guys talk.

661
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,190
I'll go out first.

662
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,030
You've finished talking with Madam He, My Lady?

663
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,290
Shall we go back first?

664
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,000
After talking to Madam,

665
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,270
he must want to talk to someone.

666
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,140
Let's wait for him.

667
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,660
I think

668
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,659
it's true that Prince Zheng has done a lot for you, My Lady.

669
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,860
But in fact, you are the one who's always kept him company.

670
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,120
He seems to

671
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,159
understand everything,

672
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,330
and care about nothing,

673
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,400
but he's actually keeping everything in his heart.

674
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,739
Sometimes, we need to cut the knot

675
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,320
to solve problems.

676
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,239
If you think too much,

677
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,199
it will only consume you.

678
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,650
Don't worry.

679
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,810
I called Li Wei here to remind her...

680
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,710
I heard

681
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,370
what you said just now.

682
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,480
People say

683
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,800
I'm not a good mother.

684
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,720
You must

685
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,130
hate me too.

686
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,720
But after what happened recently,

687
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,980
I could understand your situation better.

688
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,770
I heard that you almost hanged yourself, Mother.

689
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,580
Was that because of me too?

690
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,980
It was not because of you.

691
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,560
You were just a child.

692
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,420
What did you do wrong?

693
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,370
It was all my fault.

694
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,180
I...

695
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,800
I should apologize to you.

696
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,780
It was not your fault either, Mother.

697
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,440
You don't have to blame yourself for the past.

698
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,220
Now that you've grown up,

699
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,210
I know you have ambitions.

700
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,410
I told you before that

701
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,630
I didn't want you to take the risk

702
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
and implicate the Eleventh Prince.

703
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,860
I didn't mean any of it.

704
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,340
Actually,

705
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,340
only after I gave birth to the Eleventh Prince,

706
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,190
I finally understood how to be a mother.

707
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,710
I put my guilt to you

708
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,500
on him, and even doubled it.

709
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,850
I regret that

710
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,500
I didn't keep you company as you grew up.

711
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,200
Actually, you don't have to regret it, Mother.

712
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,610
It's not too late to make up for it.

713
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,400
Have some tea.

714
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,310
Here you go, Miss.

715
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,290
Sugar figurines.

716
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,070
Sugar figurines.

717
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,220
I resented my mother when I was young.

718
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,090
I didn't expect that I got her apology now.

719
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,320
It's been years

720
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,330
since I talked to her like this.

721
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,640
Thank you.

722
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:32,820
I didn't do much.

723
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,560
You've done a lot.

724
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,730
I want a sugar figurine then.

725
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,120
Sure.

726
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,120
Miss, take a look.

727
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Sugar figurines.

728
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,500
Thank you.

729
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,290
Here you go.

730
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,960
Okay, thank you.

731
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,560
Thank you.

732
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,760
Which one do you want?

733
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,510
I want...

734
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,860
This is a tiger.

735
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,130
Mr. Zhou.

736
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,000
What's wrong?

737
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,260
Did something happen?

738
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,410
Boss.

739
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,080
I just received this.

740
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,200
I've checked it.

741
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,600
It's made by mimeograph,

742
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,300
but the layout is wrong.

743
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,800
Look at the pattern and the handwriting.

744
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,460
They are slightly different.

745
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,920
It's indeed a counterfeit.

746
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,620
This is the large denomination I've received so far.

747
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,320
Largest?

748
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,500
We've got more of this?

749
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,040
Occasionally.

750
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,400
Especially recently.

751
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,590
Some customers said the changes we gave them are counterfeits.

752
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,070
In the end, we could only exchange them for copper coins.

753
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,650
I'm afraid that as time goes by,

754
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,180
there will be more trouble.

755
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,240
I knew there would be counterfeit notes,

756
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,570
but I didn't expect there would be so many.

757
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,850
Here's the counterfeit money I found in the market.

758
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,850
They can be passed for genuine ones.

759
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,660
Father.

760
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,560
Since the counterfeit money appeared,

761
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,680
the Ministry of Revenue has been investigating it.

762
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,800
But there are not too many counterfeits in the market yet,

763
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,330
so it's not a threat for now.

764
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,030
I think we should deal with the problem before it becomes serious,

765
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,230
and investigate exhaustively as soon as possible.

766
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,490
This is Ministry of Revenue's business.

767
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,760
What does it have to do with you?

768
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,080
I ordered Zheng to come in for discussion.

769
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,740
Although several counterfeit notes won't cause any big trouble,

770
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,500
what's affected behind it

771
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,710
is the entire Xinchuan.

772
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,960
Ministry of Revenue, lead a team

773
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,730
to investigate immediately.

774
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,640
Yes, Father.

775
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,250
The matter of counterfeit money

776
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,980
is really hard to investigate.

777
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,060
Zheng.

778
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,560
Do you know that

779
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,410
if you stretch it too hard,

780
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,590
your arm could be easily cut off?

781
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,600
If the printing for genuine notes was not leaked,

782
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,360
the counterfeit notes wouldn't have gone this far.

783
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,770
I didn't say in court that the Ministry of Revenue neglected management

784
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,800
and caused the leakage of key documents,

785
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,060
so I think I've shown you enough respect.

786
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:49,450
An.

787
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,600
If I remember correctly,

788
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,960
your people are in charge of the printing plates in the Ministry of Revenue, right?

789
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,080
Why are you in charge of the pattern, An?

790
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,380
Well...

791
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,720
It wasn't my business at first.

792
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,440
Later, Song said he was too busy,

793
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
so he left it to me.

794
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,910
He was setting a trap for you.

795
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,410
Do you really think

796
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,760
that Song is involved in the matter of counterfeit money?

797
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,890
But he won't care for

798
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,410
such little profit.

799
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,160
They put a lot of effort into the pattern design in the first place.

800
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,920
It's not that easy to counterfeit.

801
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,830
If it weren't because they've got the real plate,

802
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,560
they wouldn't have gone so far.

803
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,290
Our priority is to stop

804
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,580
the counterfeit money from circulating on the market.

805
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,300
Yes.

806
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,070
Everyone.

807
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,050
There has been a lot of counterfeit money on the market.

808
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,890
Take a look.

809
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,780
Look carefully

810
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,630
and distinguish the authenticity.

811
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,020
If you are willing to submit the counterfeits,

812
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,940
you can exchange it for a free dish

813
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,320
in Nine Regions Food Collection.

814
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,190
Really?

815
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,690
I received a few counterfeit notes

816
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,560
and they couldn't be used.

817
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,600
They don't accept counterfeit money anywhere now.

818
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,400
If we keep it to ourselves,

819
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,520
it's just a piece of waste paper.

820
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,400
It's better to submit it in exchange for something to eat.

821
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,860
Are you serious, Mr. Zhou?

822
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,370
Yes.

823
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,200
I have counterfeit money.

824
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,160
I want to exchange it for dishes.

825
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,290
I have five taels.

826
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,440
No hurry.

827
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,700
Hand in the counterfeit money to me,

828
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,690
and I'll give you a number.

829
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,280
Then you can use that number

830
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,290
to exchange the dishes for free.

831
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,730
The Danchuan Branch of Nine Regions Food Collection is about to open.

832
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,950
It can be used in the branches as well.

833
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,280
Great.

834
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,500
With such a reward,

835
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,580
everyone will work harder to collect counterfeit money.

836
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,400
In this way,

837
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,600
we can gather all the counterfeit money in the market as soon as possible.

838
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,220
I know

839
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,750
you want to support Prince Zheng and Prince An.

840
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,800
But we'll be in deficit.

841
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,030
It's okay.

842
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,120
When the Danchuan Branch is ready,

843
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,200
the Danchuan people in Xinchuan

844
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,260
will have a place to go for spicy food.

845
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,440
Consider it as a celebration.

846
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,480
I'll pay for it.

847
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,120
Don't worry.

848
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,320
We won't be in deficit.

849
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,780
They'll have free dishes,

850
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,310
but they have to give their opinions on the dishes.

851
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,040
The opinions are the most precious and valuable.

852
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,320
Besides,

853
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,600
the Ministry of Revenue has subsidies for a large amount of counterfeit money submitted.

854
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,050
We use free dishes in exchange for counterfeit money

855
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,600
to collect counterfeit money for Ministry of Revenue.

856
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,830
It can offset some cost as well.

857
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,670
I see.

858
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,080
But

859
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,010
so many people are handing in counterfeit money.

860
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,230
This means the amount of counterfeit money

861
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,760
is beyond our imagination.

862
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,190
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,420
