[Episode 16]

4
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
We sincerely

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,470
invite Princess Shangguan Jing

6
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,700
to get together

7
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,130
in the Reunion Restaurant in the east of the city.

8
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,729
Your handwriting looks much better now.

9
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:57,820
Sign it.

[Yuan Ying from the Garden of Tranquility]

11
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,539
I'm being ridiculous.

12
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,740
I even promised to take you out for fun.

13
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,210
You're the best.

14
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's take Haitang and the other girls with us.

15
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,220
Lady Ying.

16
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,070
Concubine Wei.

17
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,430
The invitation letter sent to the Legitimate Eldest Prince's residence

18
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,230
was returned.

19
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,390
I've asked around.

20
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,640
It is said that Miss Hao Jia was grounded by the the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,100
She's forbidden from associating with people of our mansion.

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,450
This is too much.

23
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,360
Hao Jia is a concubine.

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,070
She doesn't have many opportunities to come in contact with the outside world.

25
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,240
He doesn't allow anything.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,000
If she goes on being grounded like this,

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
it's not good for her.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,030
If our mansion sends another invitation letter there,

29
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,829
it's not good.

30
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,120
We need to use the help of other princes' wives

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,790
to bring her out.

32
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,290
How was it?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,610
This time, it's an invitation letter from Lady Jing.

34
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,320
His Highness has gone to the palace to serve His Lordship.

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,310
Her Ladyship didn't read it carefully and accepted it.

36
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,400
As a result, she found that you were the only one who was invited.

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,530
She was not pleased.

38
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,880
Great.

39
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,120
After receiving the invitation letter,

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,640
I can leave the mansion according to the rules.

41
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,480
But if His Highness comes back and finds out about it...

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,390
So what?

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,050
Whether I go out or not,

44
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,270
he will continue to lock me up after he comes back.

45
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,040
But if I don't get out because I'm scared,

46
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,570
I will be fully in his control sooner or later.

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,450
Don't follow me.

48
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,200
If anyone asks,

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,740
you can pretend you know nothing

50
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,780
so you don't get dragged into this.

51
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,360
Understand?

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,220
-Your Ladyship. -Just go inside.

53
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,079
Concubine Jia went out just like that.

54
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,740
His Highness will punish her when he comes back.

55
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,300
Your Ladyship, are you unhappy?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,700
Tell me.

57
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,230
Hao Jia should know better than me

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,440
what will happen if she goes out.

59
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,050
But she still made this choice.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,030
She is a fool.

61
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,910
Of course she can't compare to Your Ladyship.

62
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,680
I don't know why,

63
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,160
but since His Highness touched her last time,

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,600
I've felt

65
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,880
more bitterly disappointed.

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,780
Actually, in the past,

67
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,579
I loved going out for fun, too.

68
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,190
Everyone in the palace praised me for being clever.

69
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,990
I was as popular as the current Princess Jinchuan.

70
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,570
But later,

71
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,770
he found out about the mistake I made.

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,950
He also threatened me with it

73
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
and grounded me.

74
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,680
Didn't you say

75
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,840
you would forget it?

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,800
After that,

77
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,930
didn't His Highness treat you better?

78
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,280
Yes.

79
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,720
I forgot it at first.

80
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,170
Come on, girls.

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,180
The first toast

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,400
is to celebrate my and Ms. Yuan Ying's release from being grounded.

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,770
Cheers.

84
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,590
The second toast

85
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,940
is for Ms. Yuan Ying.

86
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,680
If she hadn't sent the invitation letter in the name of Lady Jing,

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
we wouldn't have been able to get together.

88
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,300
Come on.

89
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,610
To Yuan Ying.

90
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,000
The third toast

91
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,180
is for the most beautiful woman

92
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,670
who can finally come out for fun,

93
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,300
Hao Jia.

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,770
To the most beautiful woman in the world.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
What are you talking about?

96
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,220
You are all the most beautiful women in the world.

97
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,820
Moreover,

98
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,840
you're the the most loyal beauties.

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,280
Come on.

100
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,909
Cheers.

101
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,090
The 32nd toast

102
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,530
is for the alliance of the nine regions,

103
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,340
which makes everyone get married randomly.

104
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,070
This is good.

105
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,900
Cheers.

106
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
Get married randomly.

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,930
Cheers.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,880
Get married randomly.

109
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,750
Cheers.

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,880
Ms. Yuan Ying.

111
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,200
You're drunk.

112
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,950
I'm not drunk.

113
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,100
I'm sober.

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
Now if you ask me about

115
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,760
the accounts of Prince Zheng's mansion from February to April,

116
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,000
whichever day it is,

117
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,670
I can calculate them clearly for you.

118
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,500
Then...

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,520
Do you remember the accounts

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,760
of the pig time in the horse month of the monkey year?

121
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,440
You don't believe me, do you?

122
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,930
I'll calculate them for you now.

123
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,230
January, big.

124
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,159
Everyone,

125
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,900
today,

126
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,120
let's talk about

127
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,420
the most popular story going around the streets now,

128
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,220
the Most Favored Beauty.

129
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,160
Good!

130
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,000
How come it's this story again?

131
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,030
If this story had been

132
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,330
told in Danchuan,

133
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,800
he wouldn't have been able to start it.

134
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,240
When I was a child in Yanchuan,

135
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,210
I heard many stories like this.

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,180
Now names of stories

137
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,800
are just like this.

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,040
What if a guy is called

139
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,710
Tom, Dick, or Harry?

140
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,610
Don't they deserve a story too?

141
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,760
She happened to fall into

142
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,390
Ye Longteng's arms.

143
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,890
Ye Longteng saw how

144
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,210
this weak girl

145
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,940
who could even trip herself when she walked.

146
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,770
I can't stand this anymore.

147
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,490
Wei.

148
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,590
Where are you going?

149
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,350
He fell in love

150
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,850
with this poor girl

151
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,570
uncontrollably.

152
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,270
Shut up!

153
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,290
What kind of story is this!

154
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,850
I told you to use parallel sentences.

155
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,620
No.

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,960
Didn't you write well at school?

157
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,080
Why can't you write a good

158
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,410
article when I need you?

159
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,000
If you write like this,

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,390
how can it show my hard work and big contributions?

161
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,990
By the way,

162
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,600
of course,

163
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
you also made a small contribution.

164
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,040
The meaning is clearer if I write it in this way.

165
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,480
For the contribution of the night market, even if others can't see it,

166
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
the people can see it, right?

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,640
There is a restaurant still open for business in the distance.

168
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,960
The night market will also affect the restaurants.

169
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,320
In order to improve its competitiveness,

170
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,490
it will extend its business time.

171
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,240
If it goes on like this,

172
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,840
it will be good for Xinchuan.

173
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,000
I have many shops which are open now.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We can't lose the business at night.

175
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,860
Your Highness.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,680
Your Highness.

177
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,080
What's wrong?

178
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,720
Prince Qi

179
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,120
has come to our mansion.

180
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,240
He said it was already this late,

181
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
but his ladies hadn't come home yet.

182
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,720
When he saw the invitation letter from Lady Jing,

183
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,600
he knew that the concubine of our mansion

184
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
had been to the Reunion Restaurant.

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,680
He wanted to look for them there but he didn't dare.

186
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,530
So he sent me

187
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,240
to ask you to go with him.

188
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Zheng.

189
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
Go and take a look.

190
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
It's normal that princes' ladies

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,920
have a get-together.

192
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes.

193
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,900
Although it's late,

194
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,770
don't lose your temper.

195
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,520
Yes.

196
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:09,990
Go.

197
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,120
Your ladies are all there, too.

198
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,580
How inappropriate!

199
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,160
Which restaurant is it?

200
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,800
Nowadays, all these stories being told

201
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,820
are so bad.

202
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,380
I thought it was a story about women.

203
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,940
In the end,

204
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,680
the women could only rely on men to solve the problems.

205
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,610
But this is not the case in reality.

206
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,290
Women

207
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,140
don't fall so easily.

208
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,100
They can stand firmly

209
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,450
with their own feet.

210
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,160
So,

211
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,570
don't write a story like this anymore.

212
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,620
We can also gain happiness by depending on ourselves.

213
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,750
Whatever you can do,

214
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,180
we can also do it well.

215
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,010
Well said.

216
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,440
Yes.

217
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,690
Well said.

218
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,320
What's so good about it?

219
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,210
Where did this crazy woman come from?

220
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,000
You're so drunk.

221
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
You even talked about

222
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,140
such controversial views in front of so many people.

223
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,270
Aren't you ashamed?

224
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,920
Is there a woman like you?

225
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,640
Do you have the final say

226
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,260
about what we should do?

227
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,800
You don't know what's the right thing to do,

228
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,680
and you disobeyed the rules of a woman.

229
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,920
You're a disgrace!

230
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,160
You're a disgrace instead of me!

231
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,560
You...

232
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,040
You're self-righteous and talk harshly to hurt others.

233
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,100
You don't know your boundaries.

234
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,590
Should I care about

235
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,860
what a man like you thinks of us?

236
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,870
None of your business.

237
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,740
Right.

238
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,500
Exactly.

239
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,350
Shut up!

240
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,510
You...

241
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,000
Which family are you from?

242
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,340
None of your business.

243
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,900
What you said isn't reasonable and you lost in the debate with us,

244
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,890
so you want to complain to my family.

245
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,840
If you really don't know how to respect others,

246
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,570
just get out.

247
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,400
You're not welcome here.

248
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,850
Yes. Get out.

249
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,590
Get out!

250
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,160
Get out now!

251
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,560
You're not welcome here.

252
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,180
Let's go.

253
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,060
Go.

254
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,230
Come on.

255
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,800
Hurry up.

256
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,020
Cover your faces.

257
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,960
How embarrassing.

258
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,490
Hurry up.

259
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,990
Cover your faces.

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,760
Just look at you all.

261
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,350
Put it on.

262
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,810
Put it on.

263
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,560
One, two, three, four, five.

264
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,150
Enough.

265
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,630
An.

266
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,430
Your carriage is really roomy.

267
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,790
Stop talking nonsense.

268
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,840
You should control your women.

269
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,980
This is ridiculous.

270
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,600
I can't afford to bear the disgrace.

271
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,660
I'm leaving first.

272
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,280
Come on. Get in.

273
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,480
Get into my carriage.

274
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,850
It's okay.

275
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,610
Don't worry.

276
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,780
Come on.

277
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,300
Be careful.

278
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,160
Slowly.

279
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,140
I'm leaving first.

280
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,660
Your Ladyship.

281
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,320
Sour plum will sober you up.

282
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,440
Get sober.

283
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,780
I know I was wrong.

284
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,810
I won't go out to drink like this again.

285
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,010
You're a good drinker.

286
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,110
How much did you drink?

287
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,190
A little.

288
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,970
Let's drink!

289
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,410
Three more pots.

290
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,360
Just a little?

291
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,760
She drank three pots.

292
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,720
I couldn't stop her even if I wanted to.

293
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,450
As a result, she's so drunk now.

294
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,510
In the future, if you want to drink again,

295
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,080
at least let me know.

296
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,930
Sure.

297
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,350
Sure.

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,060
I will let you know.

299
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,390
We'll definitely let you know.

300
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
I'll send her back to her room first.

301
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,490
Let's go.

302
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,010
Be careful.

303
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,820
Is she really Princess Jinchuan?

304
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,970
Even a princess would act like this after they're drunk.

305
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,240
His Highness punished you to copy it so many times.

306
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,620
How long will it take?

307
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,040
He won't let you eat if you can't finish it.

308
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,640
It's okay.

309
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,070
Don't misunderstand it.

310
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,590
His Highness slept in my room today.

311
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,800
I was in a good mood,

312
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,850
so I had supper

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,860
and took a walk.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,580
I happened to walk by here.

315
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,750
I'm full now.

316
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,750
I'll grant the leftovers

317
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,550
to you.

318
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,030
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

319
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,080
For what?

320
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,570
I didn't make it for you specially.

321
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,890
Your Ladyship.

322
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,610
Originally, there was no problem

323
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,300
between Your Ladyship and me.

324
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,970
But there's a problematic man between us.

325
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:54,760
What?

326
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,700
Are you trying to admit defeat in front of me?

327
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,300
I'm trying to make peace.

328
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,440
Lately, Zheng and I have been managing the night market together.

329
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,680
He helped me a lot in business.

330
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,460
I couldn't say anything in front of him.

331
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,920
But you are so ridiculous.

332
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,010
You fooled around in the restaurant till so late.

333
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,930
Didn't you know I would miss you?

334
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,450
Alright.

335
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,220
Stop.

336
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,740
You shake your heads so hard that my head hurts.

337
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,540
Alright.

338
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,240
I know what you say is different from what you think.

339
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,700
You're too shy to admit that I care about you.

340
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,030
All of you

341
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,930
are naughty.

342
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,460
Alright.

343
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,300
Haitang.

344
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,570
When I went to the palace to serve and greet His Lordship,

345
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,710
Madam Xinchuan asked you to go to the palace tomorrow.

346
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,240
She wants to talk about my offspring with you.

347
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,290
Well, I feel puzzled about this.

348
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,610
You all

349
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,970
have been in the mansion for so many years.

350
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,380
Haven't any of you got pregnant?

351
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,880
Forget it.

352
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,130
I'm a little tired today.

353
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,930
You may leave.

354
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,260
Wait.

355
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,220
White Dew, stay with me tonight.

356
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,750
I'm in danger tonight.

357
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,100
I'll go in place of you.

358
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,720
Yes, Your Highness.

359
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
You are White Dew?

360
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,630
I'm your Dew.

361
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,050
Why do you look like Frost's Descent?

362
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,680
You've been together for a long time.

363
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,940
You all are becoming more and more alike.

364
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,540
Your Ladyship, please have some tea.

365
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,170
Have you seen the imperial physician?

366
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,760
Yes.

367
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,990
Your Ladyship,

368
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,410
Lady Haitang is fine.

369
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,610
Then we should ask An to see the doctor.

370
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,530
You didn't do a good job, either.

371
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,460
You're his wife,

372
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,680
and what you should care about the most

373
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,200
is An's offspring.

374
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,180
But you don't care at all.

375
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,690
I even have to ask about it personally.

376
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,410
Back then,

377
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,080
I chose you for him

378
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,000
because you looked prudent.

379
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,350
Turns out, you are indeed very prudent.

380
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,740
You only move a little after being pushed.

381
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,000
It's all my fault.

382
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,530
I'm useless.

383
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,100
If possible,

384
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,920
please give a decree

385
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,450
to let Prince An divorce me.

386
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,010
Your Ladyship.

387
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,240
I merely criticized you with a few words.

388
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,070
How could you say something so harsh?

389
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,330
Can't I criticize you?

390
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,280
It's my fault.

391
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,150
I don't deserve to be Prince An's wife.

392
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,130
Thus I should ask for a divorce.

393
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,130
Haitang,

394
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,420
did you say those words because you were angry

395
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,950
or do you really want to get divorced?

396
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,080
I can't divorce her!

397
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,850
I can't divorce her.

398
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,430
Your Ladyship.

399
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,820
Your Ladyship.

400
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Haitang and I are deeply in love.

401
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,440
No matter what mistake she made,

402
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,680
I don't want to divorce her.

403
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Enough!

404
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,140
All of you

405
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
always make me worry.

406
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,610
The eldest prince has a daughter.

407
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,040
Song has got three children.

408
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,970
One of them died.

409
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,200
The other two are not his legitimate children.

410
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,850
Mother,

411
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,470
I've tried my best to have children.

412
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,840
But unfortunately, none of them

413
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,910
can get pregnant.

414
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:10,920
I think

415
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,160
it's because they all come from a poor family.

416
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,120
They didn't grow up in good health.

417
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,410
As a man,

418
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
I won't leave any of them behind.

419
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,900
An.

420
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,050
How about you

421
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,840
go to see the imperial physician again?

422
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,390
Yes.

423
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,160
I will find a doctor

424
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,250
to treat

425
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,160
each of them.

426
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,130
I mean,

427
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,250
you should also go to see the doctor yourself.

428
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,720
Don't worry about that, mother.

429
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,680
I know how to be a husband.

430
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,560
When they go to see the doctor,

431
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,960
I will take good care of them by their sides.

432
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,850
We'll go tomorrow.

433
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,810
[Erxin Clinic]

434
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,520
I've heard that you're an outstanding gynecologist.

435
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,560
My wife hasn't been able to get pregnant for years.

436
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,860
Please take a look.

437
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,920
Okay.

438
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,870
Please ask Her Ladyship

439
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,940
to come in.

440
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,360
Come in.

441
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,040
All of you should come closer.

442
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,770
Stand still.

443
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,580
So many wives.

444
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,350
Just some of them.

445
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,810
Don't be nervous.

446
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
If the imperial physicians

447
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,480
diagnose that you have a problem,

448
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
you won't be able to stay.

449
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,480
That's why

450
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,480
I sent for a doctor from outside.

451
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,200
The diagnosis made by a doctor from outside won't be put on record.

452
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,480
No matter who has problems,

453
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,760
I'll try to let her stay.

454
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,490
Don't worry.

455
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,880
Come on, Haitang.

456
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,170
Sit.

457
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,480
All of you should line up.

458
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,060
Doctor,

459
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,200
please check on them one by one

460
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,740
to see who among them has problems.

461
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,470
You have so many wives but none of them has a child?

462
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,740
Whose problem do you think it is?

463
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,020
I don't know.

464
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,080
That's why I asked you to check on them.

465
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,480
You...

466
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,960
You should

467
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,180
stick to taking this medicine every day.

468
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,120
Take one dose every morning, noon and evening.

469
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,250
I take the medicine?

470
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,860
They don't need it?

471
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,320
No.

472
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,520
Our night market is bustling.

473
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,720
With the revenue in these several months,

474
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,320
we can finally pay off the external debts we've owed to Jinchuan.

475
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,970
Thank you, brothers.

476
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:44,610
Cheers.

477
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:05,930
An.

478
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,480
An!

479
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
Is something bothering you?

480
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,720
Let me ask both of you a question.

481
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,270
You two have been married for some time.

482
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,430
Haven't your wives

483
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,240
got pregnant?

484
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,390
In that case, it seems that

485
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,740
it's really our problem.

486
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,470
No.

487
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,120
No, it isn't.

488
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,480
An, don't talk nonsense.

489
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,540
Our situation is totally different.

490
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,900
I'm sure I don't have any problem.

491
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,670
No problem.

492
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,620
I'm fine.

493
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,260
Then whose problem is it?

494
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,560
What do you mean?

495
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,480
I don't have any problem, either.

496
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,280
I'm fine, too.

497
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,390
Well...

498
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,260
Not necessarily.

499
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,800
Patients all say they're fine.

500
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
It's better to get more nutrients.

501
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,520
Yes, get more nutrients.

502
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:17,940
Have some shrimp.

503
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,600
Here. Okra.

504
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,280
Okra is good.

505
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,320
Try not to eat cold food.

506
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Men should eat more.

507
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,120
What do you mean?

508
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,680
Okra is good.

509
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,650
Yes.

510
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,280
I'm vigorous, too. Okay?

511
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Your Highnesses.

512
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,390
Calm down.

513
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,080
Your Highnesses,

514
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,740
His Lordship summons you all to the palace to see him immediately.

515
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,930
It's surprising that

516
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,960
Jinchuan's debts have been paid off in less than two months.

517
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,530
Please have a look, My Lord.

518
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,500
Good.

519
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,200
Very good.

520
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,240
The princes

521
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,260
did a very good job.

522
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,900
You will be rewarded three times your salaries.

523
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,930
Thank you, My Lord.

524
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Currently, Mochuan's problem is the most important.

525
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,480
This year is the year of Gengzi.

526
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,700
Every 60 years,

527
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,110
our region has to send several noble ladies

528
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,510
to Mochuan for marriage.

529
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,430
But there are few

530
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,740
marriageable women in the palace now.

531
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,870
After such a long time, the Ministry of Rites hasn't come up with a list yet.

532
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,390
Do you guys

533
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,780
have any ideas?

534
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,230
Just tell me.

535
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,400
My Lord,

536
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,680
Mochuan and our region

537
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,440
have been allies for years.

538
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
We can't offend them.

539
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,830
I originally wanted to make a big sacrifice

540
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,910
by asking my younger sister, Princess Shuyu,

541
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,190
to marry far away.

542
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,340
But she is the distinguished legitimate princess.

543
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,720
If we send Madam Xinchuan's daughter there for marriage,

544
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,810
I'm afraid Mochuan

545
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,800
will become too proud.

546
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,880
After I thought about it carefully,

547
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,470
there's no other suitable candidate.

548
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,870
I have no choice but to ask

549
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,490
Princess Linlang to do so.

550
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,130
Father.

551
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,150
No.

552
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,960
Linlang is only 13 years old.

553
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,680
Even if she gets married next year or the year after next year,

554
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,080
it's still too early for her.

555
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,570
I only have one sister.

556
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
Father, please think twice.

557
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,840
Father, please think twice.

558
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,560
Enough.

559
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,330
It's inappropriate to make a fuss in the court.

560
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,630
Get up.

561
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,770
Yes.

562
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,200
Mother.

563
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,890
Song.

564
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,400
What did His Lordship say?

565
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,660
Does he really want Shuyu to marry into in a place like that?

566
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,870
Mother, don't worry.

567
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,350
Shuyu is the legitimate daughter.

568
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,760
It's impossible for us to send her out to get married for alliance.

569
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,820
But according to my father's wishes,

570
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,240
he doesn't want to order Qi's sister to get married for alliance, either.

571
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,640
We need to find another person

572
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,500
in case it would implicate Shuyu.

573
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,420
Your father

574
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,400
doesn't want to let any of his daughters get married for alliance.

575
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,260
Mochuan is a bitterly cold place.

576
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,120
It's not suitable for humans to live there.

577
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,450
The eldest prince has been stationed there.

578
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,480
He came back once a few years ago.

579
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,520
He looked

580
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,110
very gaunt.

581
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
Mother, don't worry.

582
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,720
Actually,

583
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,620
I've already got an idea.

584
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,550
An has so many women at his home.

585
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,370
Why don't we choose a beautiful one

586
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,830
as your adopted daughter,

587
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,880
and confer the title of princess on her?

588
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,200
We'll ask her to get married for alliance,

589
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
and the problem will be solved.

590
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
An, you came.

591
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,240
Greetings, Madam Xinchuan.

592
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,090
Brother.

593
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,760
An, you came.

594
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,440
We were talking about you just now.

595
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,080
I heard it.

596
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,790
There are

597
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,840
many beauties at your home.

598
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,700
Choose someone outstanding among them.

599
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,020
It's a good chance to share our father's burden.

600
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,400
Brother,

601
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,260
I also want to share our father's burden.

602
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,360
Unfortunately,

603
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,090
all my women are from a humble family.

604
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,420
They are not even members of the palace.

605
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,720
It's really inappropriate

606
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,600
to let any of them marry Prince Mochuan.

607
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,800
Even if we allow one of them to become

608
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
a member of the palace,

609
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,760
and confer the title of princess on her,

610
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,150
once

611
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,050
this matter is exposed,

612
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,090
it'll do harm

613
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,480
to the relationship between

614
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,190
Mochuan and us, won't it?

615
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,610
Right, mother?

616
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,360
[Zhongyi Hall]

617
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:41,970
Just now,

618
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,870
I couldn't say anything in front of our mother

619
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,020
in case she should think

620
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,350
we're not on good terms.

621
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,130
But after I heard what you said,

622
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,810
I think you seem dissatisfied

623
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,070
with my proposal.

624
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,620
I dare not.

625
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,720
I just think that this idea

626
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,770
might cause harm to you instead.

627
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,620
Goodbye, brother.

628
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,770
My solar term girls

629
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,360
are the best women in the world.

630
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,890
They're as good as Haitang.

631
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,700
You don't deserve to take advantage of them.

632
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,940
You deserve it.

633
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,880
To solve Shuyu's crisis completely,

634
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,560
we need to find a suitable candidate

635
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,960
and send her to Mochuan as soon as possible.

636
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,220
It's indeed a good idea

637
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,180
to get a foster daughter.

638
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,190
But what An said also makes sense.

639
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,960
If we select a woman of humble birth and send her there,

640
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,520
it'll be really inappropriate.

641
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,340
It will affect the relationship between the two regions instead.

642
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,170
Actually,

643
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,720
it's not that we have no candidate at all.

644
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,450
Speaking of a foster daughter,

645
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,650
I think we happen to have one candidate in the palace.

646
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,960
His Lordship will personally confer the title.

647
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,170
This kind of honor

648
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,570
is very unique in the palace, right?

649
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,720
Miss.

650
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,120
His Lordship has always

651
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,640
disagreed with the idea that Madam Xinchuan wants to adopt you.

652
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,560
Why does he suddenly confer the title on you?

653
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,500
This seems too good to be true.

654
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,890
There must be something wrong with it.

655
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,880
Jinping,

656
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,080
do you have to speculate every single thing everyday?

657
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,550
I really want to sell you to human traffickers.

658
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,080
They want to confer me the title.

659
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,940
Of course the reason is that

660
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,580
I'm beautiful

661
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,090
talented,

662
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,520
courageous and intelligent,

663
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
and is outstanding among everyone.

664
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,580
Be careful.

665
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,120
What happened?

666
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,160
How come there's a pit on the road?

667
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,980
So,

668
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,390
My Lord, you're conferring me the title of Princess Kening

669
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,130
because you want me

670
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,010
to marry into Mochuan as the legitimate daughter

671
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,860
of Madam Xinchuan?

672
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,710
My Lord.

673
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,600
This child is so happy that she has got quite a shock.

674
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,730
Thank His Lordship.

675
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,620
My Lord.

676
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:19,980
I...

677
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,320
I'm ordinary-looking and I have little talent and am not well educated.

678
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm timid and look very common among all the outstanding girls.

679
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,730
I don't deserve such grace.

680
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,640
My Lord,

681
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,570
Your Ladyship,

682
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,640
please be merciful and forgiving.

683
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,870
Song Wu.

684
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,160
You're Madam He's foster daughter,

685
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,440
and now you're conferred the title of Princess.

686
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,770
You should share the burden of our region.

687
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
Don't be nervous.

688
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,370
When you get married, we will send you away honorably

689
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,260
with the standard of a legitimate princess.

690
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,470
It scared me.

691
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,610
Your Highness.

692
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,080
In spring, sometimes it rains suddenly.

693
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,600
Shall we eat first?

694
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,290
Don't panic.

695
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,920
I'll close the door now.

696
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,620
It's raining heavily.

697
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,260
Miss Song.

698
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,790
Miss Song.

699
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,470
No, Miss Song.

700
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,600
Your Highness.

701
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,450
Look at her.

702
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,110
They're just bullying me.

703
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,840
Miss Song has caught a cold.

704
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,370
Let her drink the medicine.

705
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,360
What happened to you?

706
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,940
They said

707
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,650
they would confer me the title of Princess Kening.

708
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,930
What are you talking about?

709
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,010
She said

710
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,550
she had been conferred the title of Princess Kening.

711
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,640
She'll be sent to Mochuan for marriage soon.

712
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
The dowry has been sent here.

713
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,030
They've also measured her size

714
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,560
to make her a wedding dress.

715
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,540
She thought it was something good.

716
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,410
However,

717
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,370
what they wanted to do was to send her to Mochuan.

718
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,410
They have no conscience.

719
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,410
Who would want to be a princess with such predicament.

720
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,360
They have no conscience.

721
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,530
They're just bullying me.

722
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Who would want to be a princess with such predicament.

723
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,270
Is Song Wu better now?

724
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,980
Of course not.

725
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
She keeps crying.

726
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,310
I won't watch her jump into the fire pit.

727
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,890
I have experience in

728
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,610
escaping marriage.

729
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,510
But I need you to take some responsibility.

730
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,020
You have experience but you failed.

731
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Don't interrupt.

732
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,290
Then she won't be able to go to Mochuan like this.

733
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,719
There is indeed a precedent for this.

734
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,580
I'll handle it.

735
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,480
Lord Xinchuan couldn't bear to part with his own daughters,

736
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,739
so he wants Song Wu to be the alternative.

737
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,000
But every daughter is loved by her own parents.

738
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,219
That's not exactly it either.

739
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,270
Come on.

740
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,820
Look.

741
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,750
Xinchuan and Mochuan have a special relationship.

742
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,080
Xinchuan needs Mochuan to guard

743
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,940
the garrison of Changsheng Pass.

744
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,080
Besides, Mochuan is a tough and cold place.

745
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,540
It needs Xinchuan's help.

746
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,230
That's why the lords of the two regions agreed to let their daughters marry the other one's sons

747
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,830
so as to reassure each other.

748
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,659
Even if we don't want it,

749
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,989
it's indeed for the sake of the overall interests.

750
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,730
The overall interests?

751
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,930
The overall interests by sacrificing women?

752
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,060
I didn't mean that.

753
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,080
I'm just analyzing the problem from the perspectives of the two regions.

754
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,410
Why must a woman sacrifice herself for it?

755
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,360
Sacrifice is sacrifice.

756
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,340
Don't talk about the view of overall interests.

757
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,700
This

758
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,520
is a special color used for asking for a sick leave

759
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,330
which I made in the inner court study hall.

760
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,020
But at that time,

761
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,330
I had so much fun with my girl friends,

762
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,540
so I didn't use it.

763
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,870
I'm giving it to you now.

764
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,720
If we only use makeup,

765
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,720
it is just a trick after all.

766
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,960
We should still make it look more realistic.

767
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,420
Actually, I think so, too.

768
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,510
We need to make Song Wu get poisoned or get other diseases.

769
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,240
Don't worry.

770
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,480
Your life won't be in danger.

771
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,110
However,

772
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,130
you will have to suffer a little.

773
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,030
It's inappropriate, isn't it?

774
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,080
It's appropriate.

775
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,010
This is perfect.

776
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,480
If I don't suffer in this,

777
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,280
I'll have to suffer in marriage.

778
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,080
I can do it.

779
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,040
Ms. Yuan Ying.

780
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,010
Don't worry.

781
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,110
Leave it to me.

782
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,170
I'm good at this.

783
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,920
If you have something else to do, just go ahead.

784
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,060
This...

785
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,200
What are you going to do with this?

786
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,330
Have you forgotten?

787
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,500
If you eat amaranth and soft-shelled turtle soup at the same time,

788
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,520
it will be toxic.

789
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,080
During the opening banquet,

790
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,640
Prince Qi has already tried this.

791
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,200
But with the water spinach juice,

792
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,260
there will be no threats to your life.

793
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:40,630
Then,

794
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,760
why is the stomach-nourishing red spinach soup,

795
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,280
which I made previously, also here?

796
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:44,940
Good catch.

797
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,920
I made it according to your prescription.

798
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,050
It looks like blood.

799
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,220
After you drink it,

800
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,200
you can spit it out in front of others.

801
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,860
It will

802
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,330
look so real.

803
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,620
Let me try.

804
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm afraid I can't do it.

805
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,370
After I was conferred the title of princess,

806
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,730
I wanted to marry into Mochuan

807
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
so as to

808
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,240
make a contribution to Xinchuan.

809
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,570
But now,

810
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,190
I'm afraid I can't do it.

811
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,020
After I die,

812
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,800
please bury me on the way to Mochuan.

813
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,780
Write these words on my tombstone

814
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,240
"I'd like to make a contribution but I can't."

815
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,160
"It's unlucky for me to die young."

816
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,180
Look at this child.

817
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,570
Forgive my ignorance.

818
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,610
Princess Kenning

819
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,400
must have got a certain disease.

820
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,330
It should be an incurable disease.

821
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,530
According to the diagnosis from the pulse,

822
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,190
Her Highness only has a weak spleen and stomach.

823
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,670
Her pulse is three tenths more stable

824
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,530
than that of ordinary women.

825
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,940
Are you sure?

826
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,590
If they feel her pulse openly,

827
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,670
we'll surely

828
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,940
hit Song Wu so hard that her pulse will get unstable.

829
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,310
But now only you know about it.

830
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,210
If this secret is revealed,

831
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,200
we don't know whom we should hit.

832
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,390
Please tell the public that

833
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,080
Princess Kening will die soon because of deficiency in both breath and blood.

834
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,440
She can't marry far away.

835
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,100
If you're kind enough

836
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,840
and save this miserable daughter

837
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,400
so that she won't marry far away,

838
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,460
your beneficence will be boundless.

839
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,050
I understand.

840
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,650
I'll take my leave.

841
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,650
I'll see you off.

842
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,880
I've escaped another disaster.

843
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,040
Did you quarrel with my brother?

844
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,970
Brother?

845
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,570
She meant His Highness.

846
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,470
Why did you suddenly change the way how you call him?

847
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,400
Don't interrupt.

848
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,800
You quarreled with my brother, didn't you?

849
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,390
Is it obvious?

850
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,010
You took a step back just now.

851
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,940
That small movement...

852
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,270
It's nothing actually.

853
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,800
Men and women are different.

854
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,720
It's inevitable that they have conflicts.

855
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,780
They just need time

856
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,470
to make things clear, and it'll be fine.

857
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,810
One of you

858
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,630
is Yin Zheng's wife,

859
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,610
and the other used to call him dear Zheng a lot.

860
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,010
Now you try to persuade us to make peace with each other.

861
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,540
Your relationship is indeed a bit complicated.

862
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,470
Even a storyteller wouldn't write a story like this.

863
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,430
I've heard that Princess Kening is sick.

864
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,640
These are sent by His Lordship and Madam He to show their concern.

865
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,680
They're all tonics

866
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,140
and pills from the palace.

867
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,400
I've asked the imperial physician.

868
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,630
They can help treat the princess' disease.

869
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,230
Thank you.

870
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,150
I'll take my leave.

871
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,020
Goodbye.

872
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,400
No need to see me off.

873
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,240
Put them away.

874
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,630
Send them to the kitchen.

875
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,620
Send them there.

876
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,490
Recently,

877
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,080
doctors from the Imperial Hospital have been scrambling around for Song Wu.

878
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,680
Did they give you a hard time?

879
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,600
Miss Song

880
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,910
is guarded by Lady Ying and Concubine Wei.

881
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,040
There's no problem.

882
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,880
For the menu of this half a month,

883
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,240
three groups of people came to check it one after another.

884
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,880
I followed Lady Ying's and Concubine Wei's instructions

885
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,560
to cover it up.

886
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,690
Nothing went wrong.

887
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,900
Your Highness.

888
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,020
It seems that

889
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,160
Lord Xinchuan and Madam He believe it, don't they?

890
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,080
Of course not.

891
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,810
Our small tricks

892
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,200
have been seen through by them.

893
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,170
It's just that my mother loves Song Wu.

894
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,570
If we continue this show,

895
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,070
she will finish it with us.

896
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,740
That's good.

897
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,040
Then let's perform in the show well

898
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,160
with caution.

899
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,320
Ask Song Wu to feign illness for another half a month.

900
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,380
I guess this matter will be over then.

901
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,290
Your Highness, you're very thoughtful.

902
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,200
That's right.

903
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,520
I'll definitely tell Miss Song

904
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,680
to get recovered from the disease step by step

905
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,480
with various stages of improvement.

906
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,780
Yes.

907
00:41:59,490 --> 00:41:59,880
Go.

908
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,850
Come on.

909
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,860
Let me tell you about this.

910
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,790
I will never let Shuyu marry into Mochuan.

911
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,040
I've long wanted to quit being Madam Xinchuan.

912
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,520
In the palace, there are many women

913
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,380
who are more presentable than me.

914
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,570
But on this day,

915
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
as long as I'm still Madam Xinchuan,

916
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,650
I will protect my Shuyu.

917
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,860
I don't want to do that, either.

918
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,600
It's for sake of the overall interests.

919
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,160
So I have to ask Shuyu to marry into Mochuan.

920
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,200
There's something odd with Song Wu's illness.

921
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,460
Everyone can sense it.

922
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,080
It's just that Your Lordship favors Madam He.

923
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,520
You're afraid she'll be sad.

924
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,280
I don't care.

925
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,920
But you can't ask my Shuyu

926
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,950
to marry into that deadly place just because of her.

927
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,810
In front of the overall interests,

928
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,610
it's not that I don't understand your situation,

929
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,860
but please

930
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,640
choose another lady.

931
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,210
Mochuan's emissary

932
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,430
is already on his way to the capital.

933
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,070
There's no other candidate now.

934
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,080
What should we do then?

935
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,460
Well...

936
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,500
If the daughters in the palace are not suitable,

937
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,190
can we think about the grandchildren?

938
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,290
The princes have enjoyed the glory of Xinchuan.

939
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,860
They should share the burden with Xinchuan.

940
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,760
The eldest prince's daughter Ping'an

941
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,090
is already 20 years old.

942
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,030
She hasn't found a suitable husband

943
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:29,030
and hasn't got married yet, has she?

944
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,980
But with her age,

945
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,480
she's two years older than the Prince of Mochuan.

946
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,660
I've never considered her.

947
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,440
People often say the couple will

948
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,950
live a happy life if the wife is three years older than the husband.

949
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,310
Isn't that good?

950
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,460
Besides,

951
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,820
they're relying on Xinchuan now.

952
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,170
We're showing them great respect

953
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,830
by still keeping our promise.

954
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,270
The eldest prince is stationed in Mochuan.

955
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,800
Asking Ping'an to marry the Prince of Mochuan

956
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,470
is also a good alternative.

957
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,930
Yes.

958
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,470
That way, their family will be reunited.

959
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,020
That's the only way.

960
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,540
Mother.

961
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,380
Just take the medicine.

962
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,500
You're not in good health.

963
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,980
If this continues,

964
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,790
I won't be able to marry far away without worrying.

965
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,000
[Jiang Yue, Lady of the Eldest Prince]

966
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,090
I'm useless.

967
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,560
I couldn't even protect my own daughter.

968
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,830
[Princess Ping'an, Daughter of the Eldest Prince]

969
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,150
It's not that bad.

970
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,440
My grandfather asked me to marry into Mochuan.

971
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,590
I'll accept it.

972
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,480
No way!

973
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,500
[Yin Kun, the Eldest Prince]

974
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,270
-Can they control... -Father.

975
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,010
...my daughter?

976
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,380
♫Longing for softness♫

977
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,910
♫Harvesting what was planted♫

978
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:56,200
♫Gaining a moment of pleasure♫

979
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,740
♫Bearing endless sorrow♫

980
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,960
♫Writing down a dirge♫

♫Falling behind the flying time♫

♫Life is still long, how will it drag by?♫

983
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:17,860
♫Like the autumn scenery♫

984
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:19,660
♫Like blooming fireworks♫

985
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,520
♫Gone in a twinkling♫

986
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,640
♫With only silence left♫

987
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,500
♫But I'm still obsessed♫

988
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:34,350
♫With being a moth, flying to the flames♫

989
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:43,220
♫Singly stepping on the one-log bridge regardless of the strong wind, going astray♫

990
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:50,910
♫No looking back while the way ahead has no end♫

991
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:58,910
♫Just make myself trapped by obsession, and keep falling♫

00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:05,150
♫No one knows, I used♫

993
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,410

♫And learned how hard it is to know one's true heart♫

♫How should I go through the abyss-like palace life?♫

1000

♫Sighing for the blossom fall♫
