[Episode 19]

4
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,090
It takes time to meet your Mr. Right.

5
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,840
Maybe your true love

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,440
is at the next intersection.

7
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,210
Thank you for your words.

8
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,330
Jichuan mushroom.

9
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,630
Take a look.

10
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,780
Come on.

11
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,520
Fresh mushrooms.

12
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,050
It's collybia albuminosa.

13
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,259
You have a good taste.

14
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:56,860
Of course.

15
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,890
I'm from Jichuan.

16
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,250
We pick them from the mountain every summer.

17
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,120
Take more if you like.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,380
I'll pack them for you.

19
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,750
Song Wu.

20
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,000
Song Wu!

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,840
That's enough.

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,440
Thank you.

23
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,520
-Here. -Thank you.

24
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,360
Song Wu!

25
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,720
Where is Li Wei?

26
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,990
Li Wei!

27
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,640
Li Wei!

28
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,890
Song Wu.

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,660
Li Wei.

30
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,550
Where are you?

31
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,950
Li Wei.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
Song Wu.

33
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,329
Where are you?

34
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,790
Where are you?

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,530
Little girl.

36
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,420
Why are you crying here?

37
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,350
Did you call me?

38
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,860
Do you know me?

39
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,440
Who are you?

40
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,570
I'm looking for Song Wu.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,880
I'm Song Wu.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,490
Which Song Wu?

43
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,710
Sister!

44
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,610
Song Wu!

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,240
Sister!

46
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,840
Song Wu!

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,220
How could such a grown woman get lost?

48
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,870
Song Wu!

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,290
Miss.

50
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,490
How do you know my name?

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,670
Your name?

52
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,480
I am Song Wu.

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,220
Same name.

54
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,710
What a coincidence.

55
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,760
But I'm looking for a woman.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,540
Song Wu!

57
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,300
Song Wu!

58
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,800
Brother!

59
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,060
Sister!

60
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,140
-Where have you been? -Where have you been?

61
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,520
-I was so worried. -I was so worried.

62
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,050
Brother.

63
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,270
This auntie is also called Song Wu.

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,740
Auntie.

65
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,070
This is my brother.

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,530
His name is also Song Wu.

67
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,329
But his "wu" means martial arts.

68
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,150
I told you

69
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,730
not to call me auntie.

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,740
Call me sister.

71
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,190
How can you be so rude to your benefactor?

72
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,200
My sister is so naughty

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,040
that she got lost accidentally.

74
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,870
I was looking for her everywhere.

75
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,600
Thank you for sending her back.

76
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,320
You're welcome.

77
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm glad we found her.

78
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,810
Houses for dancing were inclined though the base remained.

79
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,930
Windows with beautiful decorations remained the same.

80
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,980
Your name is beautiful.

81
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,970
Your name means martial arts,

82
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,630
but you're a literary person.

83
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,240
I run a bookstore.

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,210
So I may talk too much when it comes to literature.

85
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,770
It's nothing.

86
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,030
I love reading too.

87
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,890
Where is your bookstore?

88
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,030
On the Copper-Sparrow Lane in the east market.

89
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,810
You two helped me find my sister.

90
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,810
If you are free some day,

91
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,159
please visit my bookstore.

92
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,360
If you like any books,

93
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,650
I'd like to give it to you

94
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,050
to express my gratitude.

95
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,030
I'm flattered.

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,600
How about today?

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,920
Why don't we visit another day?

98
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,680
We're going home today.

99
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,040
We'll visit another day.

100
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,570
Let's go.

101
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,460
Hurry up.

102
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:04,920
Then...

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,140
It's a deal.

104
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,550
Brother.

105
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,490
Let's go home.

106
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,480
Your Highness.

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,000
The imperial physician is outside.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,260
Why don't we invite him in to check on you?

109
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,590
No.

110
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,070
No need.

111
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,780
Your Ladyship.

112
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,920
Prince said he was tired

113
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,740
and went to bed.

114
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,130
Maybe the imperial physician can go back first.

115
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,530
Lord and Madam Xinchuan heard that Prince An is sick

116
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,490
so they specially asked the imperial physician to come.

117
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,200
At least let him take a look.

118
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,690
If he's really tired,

119
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,470
he should sleep after seeing the doctor.

120
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,870
Sleep as long as he wants.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,460
He can even sleep forever.

122
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,190
Prince said he's fine.

123
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,050
No need to bother the imperial physician.

124
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,710
Lord and Madam Xinhuan have known this matter.

125
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,380
That means everyone in the palace knows about it.

126
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,180
If you do this,

127
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,230
it'll be hard for the imperial physician to explain.

128
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,660
If people hear it

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,810
and say Prince An got a strange disease,

130
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,840
which is contagious and shameful,

131
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,710
and the mansion gets locked down,

132
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,100
we'll be in trouble.

133
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,890
I'll go in and have a look.

134
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,790
Mister,

135
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,620
please wait.

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,460
Your Ladyship.

137
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,170
Prince said

138
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,380
only the imperial physician can go in.

139
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,159
OK.

140
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,040
Let him be.

141
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,680
Please.

142
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,560
Your Highness.

143
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,450
Your pulse is a mess.

144
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,520
Have you eaten

145
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,480
something strange recently?

146
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,440
No.

147
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,490
No.

148
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
Then that's hard to tell.

149
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,710
It must be some complicated disease.

150
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,830
Sorry, I am inexperienced.

151
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,770
I'll ask other physicians

152
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,440
to check on you.

153
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,260
No need.

154
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,620
I'm fine.

155
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,840
I don't want to bother others.

156
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,130
Please check on me again.

157
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,290
You are decocting your own medicine.

158
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,120
And you don't answer my questions.

159
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,750
I really have no way.

160
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,900
Xi Yan.

161
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,210
Go to the cabinet

162
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,150
and get the prescription in the deepest place.

163
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,290
Yes, Your Highness.

164
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,750
I didn't take anything else these days.

165
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,909
I just took some medicines prescribed in Mochuan.

166
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,400
Mister, here.

167
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,920
Cartialgenous, hominis placenta, epimedium, dipsacus japonicus,

168
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,650
fructus psoraleae, aweto, and herba cynomorii.

169
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,290
These are all great tonics.

170
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,880
How could they be prescribed in one prescription?

171
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,010
This is for the dead!

172
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,070
Which quack prescribed this?

173
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,840
Not only can it not be good for your health,

174
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,370
but also shorten your life.

175
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,400
Your Highness.

176
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,520
How long have you been taking this prescription?

177
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,180
More than half a month.

178
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,900
You are still alive.

179
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,890
You are really healthy.

180
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,720
Yes.

181
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,590
Judging from the prescription,

182
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,450
Your Highness,

183
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,820
you got cheated.

184
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,870
No way.

185
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,410
But what you said makes sense.

186
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,750
I do think the way that bastard looked at me

187
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,730
is quite strange.

188
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,880
I didn't want to

189
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,880
bother the imperial physicians at first.

190
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,160
Having an unmentionable disease

191
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,860
is not my wives' fault.

192
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,550
So I don't want others to know.

193
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,750
Your Highness, so your unmentionable disease...

194
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,240
It is not about this.

195
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,620
It's that I don't have a child until now.

196
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,780
You should have told me earlier.

197
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,910
But you can't ask for prescriptions everywhere.

198
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,500
What if you get sick?

199
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,150
Mister.

200
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,470
Your expression...

201
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,250
Just say it.

202
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,550
I can handle it.

203
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,110
It's strange.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,750
Although you took the wrong medicine

205
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,280
which made your pulse weak,

206
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,980
in terms of having a baby,

207
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,320
you should be fine.

208
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,060
Based on my years of experience,

209
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,630
you are definitely not sterile.

210
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,020
Are you telling the truth?

211
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,930
Yes, Your Highness.

212
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,630
But why haven't I had a child

213
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,540
for so many years?

214
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,850
Frost's Descent.

215
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,250
Here.

216
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,160
Today is your birthday.

217
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,040
Make a wish.

218
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,040
Okay.

219
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,040
I hope...

220
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,580
All right.

221
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,130
I am done.

222
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,760
Let's eat.

223
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,140
Haitang,

224
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,580
come and eat.

225
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,500
Good timing.

226
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,050
Sisters.

227
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,350
Guess what I heard in front of An's room.

228
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,270
What?

229
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,140
He told the imperial physician

230
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,320
that he took medicines recklessly

231
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,450
because he suspected that he had an unmentionable disease

232
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,780
which made him sterile.

233
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,630
Which doctor prescribed that prescription?

234
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,930
He's doing good deeds.

235
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,490
Exactly.

236
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,530
We should give the doctor a plaque.

237
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,600
There are only four words on the plaque.

238
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,750
Quite a good jod.

239
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,220
Isn't this karma?

240
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,140
I remember

241
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,620
he wanted to buy me a birthday gift last year.

242
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,480
But he forgot that when he went out

243
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,290
and finally bought himself a piece of jade.

244
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,150
He bought a piece of jade for himself on my birthday.

245
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,120
Every time he meets a new person.

246
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,680
Sisters,

247
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,230
let me show you how he does.

248
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,330
Miss,

249
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,080
you are the person on the tip of my heart.

250
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,250
Sisters.

251
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,320
It turns out that

252
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,700
his heart

253
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,070
is a durian

254
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,130
which is covered by tips.

255
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,940
And the tips are full of people.

256
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,390
Full of people.

257
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,370
Keep eating.

258
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,440
Enjoy yourselves.

259
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,440
White Dew, is your noodles a little bland?

260
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,840
You need some seasoning.

261
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,640
No.

262
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,770
I think it's good.

263
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,730
You need to add some.

264
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,170
I happen to have a bottle.

265
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,050
Add it.

266
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,250
Add it.

267
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,170
Here.

268
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
I'll do it for you.

269
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,160
What are you doing?

270
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,770
Shut up!

271
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,560
Tell me what this is.

272
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,980
What is this?

273
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,780
Birth control.

274
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,850
Switching shifts.

275
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
How smart you are.

276
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,040
I am cheated by you every day.

277
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,050
Why?

278
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,910
Why!

279
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,970
I don't care about others.

280
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,300
White Dew.

281
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,170
Tell me.

282
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,450
I am so gentle and considerate to you.

283
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,610
Why are you unwilling to have my baby?

284
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,190
I celebrate your birthday every year.

285
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,600
Aren't you happy?

286
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,150
Am I not good enough to you?

287
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,040
Stop eating!

288
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,930
Tell me why!

289
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,770
Dew!

290
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,830
Listen!

291
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,670
My name is Frost's Descent.

292
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,560

[Frost's Descent  Major Heat  Winter Solstice]

297
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,370
I think I was too nice to you

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and indulged you.

299
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,260
That's why we're here.

300
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,150
In this case,

301
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,120
I have to execute the domestic discipline

302
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,550
to let you know

303
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,270
who is in charge here.

304
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,630
Guards!

305
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,970
Yes, Your Highness.

306
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,440
It's not too late for you to repent.

307
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,220
I'm asking you if you're afraid.

308
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,890
Beat them!

309
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,000
Beat them until they admit their mistake.

310
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,750
Haitang, answer me.

311
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,160
Do you admit your mistake or not?

312
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Just beat me if you want.

313
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,560
You...

314
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,350
Stop!

315
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,280
Haitang.

316
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:45,930
Li Wei.

317
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,730
What are you doing here?

318
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,940
Prince An.

319
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,300
The person who married you

320
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,430
and became your lady

321
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,250
was chosen by Lord Xinchuan.

322
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,450
If you beat her,

323
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,290
you'll be disobeying the Lord.

324
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:02,990
Fine.

325
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,300
I won't hit her.

326
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,070
I brought the others back myself.

327
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,210
It has nothing to do with the Lord.

328
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:07,810
Prince An.

329
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,580
Lord Xinchuan hopes all princes

330
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,160
can manage their family and seek peace.

331
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,530
You just made contributions in Mochuan

332
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,750
and had some opportunities.

333
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,780
If the news gets to Lord Xinchuan,

334
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,820
the reward will become a punishment.

335
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,930
Why bother?

336
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,950
Great-aunt!

337
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,470
This...

338
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,520
Cool.

339
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,720
They are all important.

340
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,790
I can't beat them.

341
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,390
But honestly,

342
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,530
if I hadn't brought you back,

343
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,600
where would you be now?

344
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,130
You might even have died.

345
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,320
I brought you to the mansion

346
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,600
and let you live a good life.

347
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,840
What else do you dislike?

348
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,810
Prince An!

349
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,790
It's true that you saved us.

350
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,390
We will never forget your kindness.

351
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,560
But

352
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,880
did you ask our will

353
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,410
before you brought us home?

354
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,130
You tricked

355
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,100
all of us home.

356
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,200
For example,

357
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,990
you said I would be the only one you love in your life.

358
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,050
But what happened?

359
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,850
After I moved in, I found it's one after another.

360
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,050
You lied to us first.

361
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,210
I didn't lie.

362
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,400
You're just doing it for your own selfish interests.

363
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,040
Coaxing us when you're happy.

364
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,390
When you're unhappy, you just ignore us

365
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,109
and find a new one.

366
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:08,910
That's right.

367
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,750
What kind of good life is this?

368
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,760
Other people's good life is not like this.

369
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,800
You don't treat us as humans.

370
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,010
That's right.

371
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,030
You don't treat us as humans.

372
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,540
Nonsense!

373
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,210
I did all for your own good.

374
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,990
But look at what you have done!

375
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,800
Sure.

376
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,930
Your Highness,

377
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,150
you are a kind person.

378
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,290
Why don't you let us go?

379
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll pay back the money I owe you.

380
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,230
Life outside is hard,

381
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,450
but at least I am free.

382
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,160
I never wanted you to pay me back.

383
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,240
If you are unhappy,

384
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,490
just tell me.

385
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,810
Will that work?

386
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,940
I did tell you.

387
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,950
But you said I was ill

388
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,920
and asked the pharmacist to prescribe a bunch of medicine for me.

389
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,680
You made me take medicine like having meals.

390
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,110
Yes.

391
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,360
Speaking of eating,

392
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,880
if we gain some weight,

393
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,960
you will punish us.

394
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,620
You punished Lady by not letting her eat and drink.

395
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,350
You made her faint from hunger.

396
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,270
I may have gone too far before.

397
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,290
But that's because I care about all of you.

398
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,770
I hope you can get better.

399
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,140
Then you care about too many people.

400
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,310
Yeah!

401
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,170
OK.

402
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,530
Since you are not satisfied with

403
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,770
what I do,

404
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,770
from now on,

405
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,360
I will cut off all of your monthly allowance.

406
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,480
I want you to know

407
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,570
how good I was to you.

408
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,250
Then there's no need to stay.

409
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,190
That's right.

410
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,750
We wanted to leave long ago.

411
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,820
I can't live like this anymore.

412
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,060
I'm leaving today.

413
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,420
Just leave.

414
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,920
If you leave the mansion today,

415
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,100
you'll starve to death tomorrow.

416
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,020
Leave if you dare.

417
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,100
Do you dare?

418
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,910
Stop!

419
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:06,680
Stop!

420
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,510
Don't go!

421
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,210
Let's go.

422
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,510
We don't want to stay here anymore.

423
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,790
Stop! Stop!

424
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,280
What are you doing?

425
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,810
Haitang.

426
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,100
Haitang, talk to them.

427
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,830
Great-aunt.

428
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,750
Great-aunt.

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,310
Haitang!

430
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,470
Dong Haitang!

431
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,570
I'll go check if they really left.

432
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,440
Are you okay?

433
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,030
Apply more medicine.

434
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Is your hand okay?

435
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,600
I'm fine too.

436
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,110
Are you okay?

437
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm fine.

438
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,380
Are you okay?

439
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,960
Yes.

440
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,960
Is everything packed?

441
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,470
Yes.

442
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,240
We're done.

443
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,180
What about you?

444
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,950
I'm done too.

445
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,790
Sisters,

446
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,050
since everyone is ready,

447
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,380
let's stop hesitating.

448
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,390
We can't live like this anymore.

449
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,920
Even if we have no money and have to live on the streets,

450
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,010
we can't stay here any longer.

451
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,920
That's right.

452
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,760
I can't stay here anymore.

453
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,380
Haitang,

454
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,530
leave with us.

455
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,170
Yes!

456
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,950
Let's leave together.

457
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,290
You were brought back by An

458
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,500
and were not registered.

459
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,760
You can leave anytime.

460
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,050
But I can't.

461
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,820
If I leave,

462
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,470
I can live a free life

463
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,900
but people in Cangchuan will be hurt.

464
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,830
Don't worry about me.

465
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
I'm the Lady of Third Prince.

466
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,890
What can he do to me?

467
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,240
But what will you do after you leave?

468
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,060
Who will take you in?

469
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,330
They may not need that.

470
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,770
They can live

471
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,380
on their own.

472
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,840
Li Wei and I have discussed it.

473
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,560
As long as you are willing,

474
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,110
we can invest together

475
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,120
to buy and run a restaurant.

476
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,950
A restaurant?

477
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,020
Everyone is struggling to make a living.

478
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,490
As long as you have a foundation,

479
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,080
you can travel freely.

480
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,380
White Dew and Frost's Descent,

481
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,590
you're smooth talkers.

482
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,120
You can attract customers.

483
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,040
Grain Buds and Greater Heat,

484
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,360
both of you have performed and worked.

485
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,000
In that case,

486
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,700
why don't we open a restaurant together?

487
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,960
We can make money

488
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,450
and you can have a place to stay.

489
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,310
It's a win-win situation.

490
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:45,950
It's a good idea.

491
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,400
That makes sense.

492
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,530
That's a good idea.

493
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,920
But I've never heard of

494
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,600
a woman running a business in Xinchuan.

495
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,860
It must be hard.

496
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,320
Yeah.

497
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,970
I've never heard of this.

498
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,720
It's true.

499
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,210
But think about it,

500
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,410
we only heard that

501
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,510
it's against the rules for women to do business.

502
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,050
We've never seen an official order that clearly prohibits that.

503
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,000
In that case,

504
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,170
it means we have a chance.

505
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,810
In business,

506
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,520
men and women are the same.

507
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,550
It's just that

508
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,790
people will gossip about a business woman.

509
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,270
What's there to be afraid of?

510
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,000
You're right.

511
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,950
That makes sense.

512
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,430
Life is never easy anyway.

513
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,640
Why don't us fight for ourselves?

514
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,360
Yeah, give it a shot.

515
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,500
What do we sell?

516
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,690
We can open a restaurant

517
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,090
for people to enjoy tea and mahjong.

518
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,440
My mom taught me paper-cutting.

519
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,050
We can sell paper-cuttings.

520
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,630
We can open a pastry store.

521
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,440
How could you steal my idea?

522
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,400
I said it first.

523
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,850
I think we can open a restaurant

524
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,330
where guests can enjoy specialities from the nine regions.

525
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,230
You can cook the specialities in your hometown.

526
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,560
I am sure that we can make money.

527
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,070
Yeah.

528
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,970
That's a good idea.

529
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,970
This is good.

530
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,320
Great.

531
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,280
Yeah.

532
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,810
I asked Chef Liu to make this red bean soup.

533
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,760
There are dried osmanthus and gorgon fruit in it.

534
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,590
It's delicious.

535
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,240
Try it.

536
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,780
Just say it.

537
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,690
What happened?

538
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,930
Yuan Ying and I broke into Prince An's mansion

539
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,180
and set the solar term girls free.

540
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,790
They ran away from home.

541
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,590
All of them?

542
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,270
There's one left.

543
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,840
Haitang.

544
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,260
What do you mean?

545
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,540
The girls want to do their own business

546
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,210
and live on their own.

547
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,440
Yuan Ying and I want to use our dowry

548
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,100
to support them.

549
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,620
You said once the night market stabilizes,

550
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,740
women may try to do business.

551
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,380
Does that still count?

552
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,590
Women doing business...

553
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,960
But this matter has not been mentioned to the Lord yet.

554
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,820
I'm afraid it'll be troublesome.

555
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,390
But if there's any trouble,

556
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,050
we will solve it together.

557
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,260
Really?

558
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,230
Thank you.

559
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,050
We'll try ourselves first.

560
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,660
You're so nice.

561
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,640
Remember to drink the soup.

562
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,080
Okay.

563
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,480
All of them.

564
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,890
Oh no.

565
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,760
[Garden of Triumph]

566
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,350
Your Highness hasn't visited me for a long time.

567
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,520
Since you acknowledged your mistake,

568
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,060
I won't blame you for what happened last time anymore.

569
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,130
Just this once.

570
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,000
Recently,

571
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,190
I've been too busy

572
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,860
with affairs of the Ministry of Revenue.

573
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,490
You seldom come and visit me.

574
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,810
I'm bored all day.

575
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,130
Can you allow me

576
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,200
to hang out with Lv Ming?

577
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,400
You're going to see the Jichuan girl, right?

578
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,310
Of course not.

579
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,450
You think too much.

580
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,570
Do you know?

581
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,440
There are so many

582
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,730
affairs of the Ministry of Revenue

583
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,250
because Zheng proposed

584
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,340
to use paper currency to substitute coins.

585
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,610
This case got me stuck.

586
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,870
Now Father is appointing him

587
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,110
to manage the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

588
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,120
The more he's in charge of,

589
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,650
the more trouble I will get.

590
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,210
Do you understand what I mean?

591
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,680
Yes, Your Highness.

592
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,560
Good.

593
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,240
Don't see that Jichuan girl anymore.

594
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,400
And that Danchuan girl.

595
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,650
Don't meet them anymore.

596
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,290
They're all birds of a feather.

597
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,040
I won't repeat

598
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,140
what I just said to you again.

599
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,490
Come here.

600
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,370
Long time no see.

601
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,090
You look more beautiful.

602
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,570
I'll tell the kitchen

603
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,890
to cook more delicious food for you.

604
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,760
I remember you like...

605
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,060
river snails rice noodles, right?

606
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

607
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Actually, these are not important.

608
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,580
What matters is

609
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,170
you do care about me.

610
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,460
I'm happy about that.

611
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,930
Let's go.

612
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,060
The mushroom will be more easily preserved after airing for a few days.

613
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,990
In our hometown,

614
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,520
there are even people

615
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,310
who specialize in picking mushroom.

616
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,440
They carry bamboo baskets and walk dozens of miles early in the morning

617
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,530
to pick mushroom in the mountains.

618
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,510
Smell it.

619
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,480
Spring

620
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
is really coming.

621
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,640
Li Wei,

622
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,310
can you

623
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,140
do me a favor?

624
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,970
What is it?

625
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,980
Can you help me marry Mr. Song?

626
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,030
But you only met him once.

627
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,320
He's surpassed countless people.

628
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,760
You already became literary?

629
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
I think he's different from others.

630
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,190
He's so special

631
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,740
and so interesting.

632
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,920
But I hope it

633
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,560
won't seem that I'm in a rush.

634
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,840
It's best to make him voluntarily and desperately

635
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,920
want to marry me.

636
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,530
I think it's a little difficult.

637
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,780
I suggest you go out, turn right and find a sorceress.

638
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,630
Li Wei.

639
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,270
My dear Li Wei.

640
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,570
I know you have a way.

641
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,570
Please help me.

642
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,530
I am begging you.

643
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,650
Let me think.

644
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,820
Any idea?

645
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,810
Not so fast.

646
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,730
Think about it.

647
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,650
Although I can't figure out a way right away,

648
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,440
there's a story that might inspire you.

649
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,010
Okay.

650
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,960
Then tell me.

651
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,170
When my mom was young,

652
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,420
she met my dad.

653
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,040
She saw my dad was handsome and kind

654
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,960
so she fell in love with him.

655
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,960
And then she decided to take the initiative.

656
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,890
[Li Wenbi's field]

657
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,630
Let's go.

658
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,100
Dad wanted to thank mom for her help.

659
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,310
But my mom was shy.

660
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,080
And then?

661
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,790
Then my mother

662
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,340
found a matchmaker to propose marriage.

663
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,870
My grandparents were very satisfied.

664
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,380
So dad had no way but

665
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,990
to marry my mom.

666
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,470
But before they got married,

667
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,990
dad still wanted to see who was the bride.

668
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,840
She's coming.

669
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,680
After knowing mom's sincerity,

670
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,160
dad was very touched.

671
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,650
They've been together until now.

672
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,090
But guess what?

673
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,580
The troublemakers in the field

674
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,640
and the people who proposed at the door

675
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,280
were my uncle's friends.

676
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,330
I didn't expect your mom to be so smart.

677
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,150
Of course.

678
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,350
My mom is the only person

679
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
who could use this method to trap...

680
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,300
to pursue my dad.

681
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,480
Then tell me,

682
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,690
can I use this method to trap...

683
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
to pursue Song Wu?

684
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,060
Let's try.

685
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,930
But

686
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,720
your mom had your uncle's help.

687
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,820
Who should I resort to?

688
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,110
It can't be you.

689
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,290
He has met you.

690
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,890
If my brother...

691
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,090
No.

692
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,140
My brother is too stubborn.

693
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,550
He won't help me.

694
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,300
Then can I...

695
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,440
Someone is suitable.

696
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,790
Give it out!

697
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,290
What is this?

698
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:06,690
Money.

699
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,540
Who wants your money?

700
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,070
Get lost!

701
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,920
You haven't paid for the book.

702
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,550
Yeah.

703
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,440
How could you not pay for the book?

704
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,160
Good job!

705
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,430
Listen.

706
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,620
Hand over

707
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,370
the most expensive book collection.

708
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,170
Otherwise...

709
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,960
Why isn't she here yet?

710
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,690
I don't know.

711
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,080
So slow.

712
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,420
It's too late.

713
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,080
She didn't make it in time.

714
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,320
She's coming.

715
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,740
How dare you!

716
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,720
Don't be afraid, Mr. Song.

717
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
I'll protect you.

718
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,440
In broad daylight,

719
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,670
in this peaceful country,

720
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,460
how dare you rob?

721
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,650
I will defeat you on behalf of justice!

722
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,600
Then I'll show you

723
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,120
the power of darkness.

724
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,710
Go!

725
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,620
Go!

726
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,450
I didn't expect such a small body to be so powerful.

727
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,010
Goodbye.

728
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,610
Bastard, stop!

729
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,190
If you beg now,

730
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,710
I can consider sparing your life.

731
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,860
Please spare my life.

732
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,000
I didn't recognize you.

733
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,170
I don't accept your apology.

734
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:41,810
Be gentle.

735
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,820
I know what to do.

736
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,210
Bastard!

737
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,440
Disgusting!

738
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,830
Bastard!

739
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,520
Shameless!

740
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:47,960
Stop.

741
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,660
Do you know each other?

742
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,480
-No. -No.

743
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,570
I think you two

744
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,670
are not destined to be together.

745
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,370
How about we change to another one?

746
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,280
Stop it.

747
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,890
Yeah.

748
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,040
Don't say that.

749
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,440
She's even more painful.

750
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,110
Alright.

751
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,520
Song Wu, stop crying.

752
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,670
Here's the thing.

753
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,260
Your idea is so bad

754
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,360
and your acting is so poor.

755
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,630
It's inevitable to get caught.

756
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,760
Shut up!

757
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,370
Princess.

758
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,820
Mr. Song is here.

759
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,850
How do you know I live here?

760
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,409
You left this.

761
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,080
I asked around

762
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,520
and knew you live here.

763
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,590
Thank you.

764
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,380
I'm sorry

765
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,180
for what happened today.

766
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,140
Mr. Song,

767
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,320
I broke your bookstore.

768
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,040
I should pay for it.

769
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,460
Mr. Song, how much do you think is appropriate.

770
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,570
No need for compensation.

771
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,650
It won't cost much.

772
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,130
It's fine.

773
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,970
No.

774
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,160
I must compensate you.

775
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,840
I feel so guilty

776
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,240
about today's incident.

777
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,250
If I don't compensate you,

778
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,890
I can't sleep well at night.

779
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:21,820
Then...

780
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,360
You can pay me 1,000 coins.

781
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,760
That little?

782
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,880
That's a lot.

783
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,500
Okay.

784
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,260
Mr. Song,

785
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,700
please wait a moment.

786
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,340
Here.

787
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

790
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Here's the thing.

791
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,220
My brother takes charge of

792
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,950
all my money.

793
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,190
He is

794
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,020
very stingy

795
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,210
and only gives me a little money every month.

796
00:35:59,210 --> 00:35:59,770
So

797
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,930
I just want to discuss with you.

798
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,650
I may

799
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,020
go to your bookstore every day.

800
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,570
I'll pay it back day by day.

801
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,130
What do you think?

802
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:13,470
Okay.

803
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,520
Miss Song.

804
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,830
I'm here today

805
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,450
to ask you a question.

806
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,850
Why did you

807
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,140
do that?

808
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,200
It's all my fault.

809
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,480
I know you must hate me now.

810
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,460
But please.

811
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Please don't hate me.

812
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,270
I'm sorry.

813
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,220
Miss Song!

814
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,950
Why are you here?

815
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,030
Is she our target?

816
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,370
Yes, but let me tell you.

817
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,410
Don't worry.

818
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,370
No need. Come back.

819
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,190
Miss Song.

820
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,310
I've admired you for a long time.

821
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,640
Please give me a chance.

822
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,880
I came here first.

823
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,710
My ancestors and the Song family were best friends.

824
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,590
Stop acting.

825
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,780
Mr. Song.

826
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,630
Stop acting.

827
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,510
Stop arguing!

828
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,220

829
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,540

Princess.

831
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,460
Stop calling me Princess.

832
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,800
Just call me Song Wu.

833
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,280
I'm just Song Wu.

834
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,990
I just want to know

835
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,590
if you understand

836
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,170
my feelings?

837
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,200
Princess is graceful

838
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,170
and has many pursuers.

839
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,610
All of them are elite.

840
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm just a commoner.

841
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,570
Do you still want to say this

842
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,840
even though you know my feelings?

843
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,700
There's no pursuers.

844
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,560
I asked them to act.

845
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,720
I just want you to...

846
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,460
I just want you to be nervous.

847
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,210
And just now I said I would pay you back day by day.

848
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,730
I just found a stupid way

849
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,010
to see you more.

850
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,830
I know

851
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,960
we haven't known each other for long.

852
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,560
But you're different from the playboys I know.

853
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,920
I have a crush...

854
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,040
That's why I did so many stupid things.

855
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,670
But

856
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,770
you're a smart person.

857
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,670
You should understand that, right?

858
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:35,570
Miss Song.

859
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:52,850

860
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,370
Why are you still up?

861
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,490
I'm not sleepy.

862
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,490
Go to sleep.

863
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,490
Are you thinking about Auntie Song Wu?

864
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:03,520
I told you.

865
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,680
Call her sister.

866
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,040
Does she want to be my sister-in-law?

867
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,000
Don't talk nonsense.

868
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,810
Only children can see it clearly.

869
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,310
You've been staring at this jade pendant all day.

870
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,510
You're just thinking

871
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,090
whether you like her or not.

872
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,860
Tell her if you like her.

873
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,870
But she is a princess.

874
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,870
I'm just a commoner.

875
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,210
How can I match her?

876
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,320
You are so knowledgeable.

877
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,250
How could you not be good enough for her?

878
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,570
Love is love.

879
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,480
If you mix it with money and status,

880
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,880
what kind of love is that?

881
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,830
All right.

882
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:35,970
Go to sleep.

883
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,400
Adults are so boring.

884
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,600
They even bother themselves with this.

885
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,590
Mr. Song,

886
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,640
you want to see me?

887
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,830
You forgot it.

888
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:07,980
Thank you.

889
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,560
Miss.

890
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,470
What?

891
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:19,790
Mr. Song,

892
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,500
you sent the jade to the mansion yesterday.

893
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,560
You could just leave it here.

894
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,800
Servants will collect it.

895
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,460
Why did you take it away again?

896
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,280
Did you...

897
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,240
Did you think if you took the jade...

898
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,300
I could have a reason to see you again.

899
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,860
It's nice to see them together.

900
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,110
But I'm still worried.

901
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,440
How about you

902
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,080
find some ways to test

903
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,790
the character of Song Wu.

904
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,280
If you're worried, why did you help them?

905
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,400
Song Wu likes him.

906
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,280
But marriage is different.

907
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,380
Why don't you take him to a brothel

908
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,640
to see if he will enter?

909
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,490
How about

910
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,160
give him five million taels

911
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,050
and let him leave Song Wu?

912
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,450
Let's see if he'll leave.

913
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,780
You're a man anyway.

914
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,040
Man knows man the best.

915
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,070
Think of a way.

916
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,530
Okay.

917
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,180
Song Wu is my sister.

918
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,460
She's also my sister.

919
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,050
We have to keep an eye on her.

920
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:46,920
Sorry.

921
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,300
We're closed.

922
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,160
I'm not buying books.

923
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,530
I'm looking for you.

924
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,340
Please, Your Highness.

925
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,690
Mr. Song has a lot of books.

926
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,490
I only have those books.

927
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,950
If there's any inconvenience,

928
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,010
please forgive me.

[Painting Album]

930
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,940
You even read painting albums?

931
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,450
This is my sister's.

932
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,950
She went to the study hall.

933
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,410
I have to pick her up later.

934
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,000
I know.

935
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,950
Song Wu told me that.

936
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,480
Your parents are gone.

937
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,540
It must be hard to take care of your sister alone.

938
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,410
Not really.

939
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,720
My parents passed away long ago

940
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,210
so my sister and I live by each other.

941
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,200
We're used to it.

942
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,260
Have a seat.

943
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,860
You're here today

944
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,680
because of Princess Kening?

945
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,800
You're quite capable.

946
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,470
Song Wu has never fallen in love with anyone.

947
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,670
I just want to ask you.

948
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,080
With the condition of your family,

949
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,430
if you marry Song Wu,

950
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,430
what's your plan?

951
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,050
With my current status,

952
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,150
I'm not good enough for her.

953
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,190
But I will do my best in the imperial exam this year.

954
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,650
I'll marry her after I become an official.

955
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,450
I'll do my best

956
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,240
to give her the best life.

957
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,750
Are you that confident?

958
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,200
I have been studying for ten years,

959
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,560
making friends with books.

960
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,580
I know my level.

961
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,730
I've read your article.

962
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,770
It's quite good.

963
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,000
How about this?

964
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,990
I can recommend you for a suitable official position,

965
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,600
so you can avoid the imperial exam.

966
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,530
It's easier to take care of Song Wu.

967
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,630
What do you think?

968
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,760
I am grateful

969
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,100
that Your Highness would like to me.

970
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,510
But

971
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,520
I can't do as you say.

972
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,210
Why?

973
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,780
I do like Miss Song Wu.

974
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,920
After knowing that she is a princess,

975
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,970
I feel ashamed.

976
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,240
I'm more afraid

977
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,990
she would suffer with me.

978
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,110
But

979
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,040
Miss Song believes that I can take good care of her.

980
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,500
If I take advantage of her,

981
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,910
I'm afraid I'll feel guilty in the future.

982
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,770
That's not what I have learned in the past ten years.

983
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,750
As for the imperial exam,

984
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,550
I hope Your Highness can let me do it alone.

985
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,720
♫The wind talks softly to me♫

986
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,370
♫Listen how the time sings lightly♫

987
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:55,140
♫Fireworks are in full bloom, scattering the sky with the past♫

988
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,200
♫The stars are climbing up my heart♫

989
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,540
♫The eyes of the night shine with moonlight♫

990
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:08,660
♫Remembering your face at this time♫

991
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:15,250
♫We stumbled through yesterday♫

992
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:21,750
♫Tonight's dream slowly flows through your fingers♫

993
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:28,800
♫We're about to stay together for years and years♫

994
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,320
♫We'll travel together for years and years♫

995
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,580
♫The clouds are quietly looking up♫

996
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:55,140
♫The sky is light and the wind is cool and here comes a secret fragrance♫

997
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:01,880
♫The paper kite flutters and bids farewell to the wanderings of the past♫

998
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,080
♫The road ahead looks far away♫

999
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,430
♫The world is wide♫

1000
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,340
♫Cold or warm, you're by my side♫

1001
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,820
♫Spring flowers are fearless and love grows among the thorns♫

1002
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:28,440
♫The summer breeze is dying, the sun is burning, it's all but ordinary♫

1003
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:35,480
♫Autumn leaves fall, waiting for you and me to write a new chapter♫

1004
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,120
♫After the winter snow comes the warm sunshine ♫

1005
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:48,520
♫We stumbled through yesterday♫

1006
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:55,040
♫Tonight's dream slowly flows through your fingers♫

1007
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:02,310
♫We're about to stay together for years and years♫

1008
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:08,060
♫We'll travel together for years and years♫
