They are coming.

They are not coming.

They are coming.

They are not coming.

They are coming.

They are not coming.

10
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,060
Are they coming or not?

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,330
I'm starving.

12
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,120
If you're really hungry,

13
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,390
take a small bowl and get some food to eat.

14
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,070
Butler Su,

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,060
the dishes and wine

16
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,180
are cold, right?

17
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,740
Tell the kitchen to heat them up again.

18
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
Heat them up again, Your Highness?

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,560
If I had known this,

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
I wouldn't have changed His Highness's wine into water.

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
Since there are no guests,

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,480
why don't we get drunk together with His Highness?

23
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,040
Why are we still waiting?

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,600
We've been waiting for hours.

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
It's dark outside.

26
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,160
I think we should stop waiting.

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,370
No one will come.

28
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,670
Is there anyone?

29
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,450
What took you so long?

30
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,840
I was delayed by something.

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,300
Look,

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,780
this is the wine I brought from Danchuan.

33
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,110
I kept it for two months.

34
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,680
Thank you, Princess Shangguan.

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,610
You're welcome.

I knew that you would come.

40
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,570
We must come here.

41
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,460
We've been putting on makeup for two hours.

42
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,450
We must come here.

43
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,560
We've tried the samples for so long.

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,000
We must come and check the results.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,530
You are so beautiful today.

46
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,850
You all came here yourselves.

47
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,670
Where is Prince An?

48
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,620
He is timid and doesn't dare to come.

49
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,530
He didn't let us come either.

50
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,220
Luckily, Winter Solstice pretended to be sick and stopped him.

51
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,820
Then we managed to come here.

52
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,620
Awesome.

53
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,850
The same goes for Qi.

54
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,740
He's at home hanging about.

55
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,130

57
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,170
What are you saying, Shangguan?

58
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,180
Don't talk nonsense.

59
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,200
I came late because I was preparing a gift.

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,600

61
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,160

I'm fine.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,780
How can you want to protect me?

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,710
Why can't I protect you?

66
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,110
Give it a second thought.

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Today you have your mansion.

68
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,330

72
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,519
The street in front of your gate is narrow.

73

My big carriage can't even get in.

76

Didn't you say that you weren't coming?

77
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,700
I'm not here for the new mansion banquet.

78
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,810
I'm here to take you home on my way.

79
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,280
Is there a problem?

80
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,440
You brought a present when you came to pick them up?

81
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,970
I thought that since I would come here anyway,

82
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,720
I would bring you something.

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,200
Yes.

84
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,860
Have a look.

85
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,050
As one who has experienced it, I know what to bring.

86
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,680
I'll take them to the kitchen now.

I slept late during the nap.

Brother Zheng, you aren't angry, right?

96
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,860
No.

it's fine that you have a mansion before me.

152
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,840
The point is that you married the princess of Jinchuan.

Your concubine is lively and lovely.

154
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,350

You take all the benefits.

156

You can't even shut up with so many dishes here.

157
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,600
You should try using your gun.

158
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,710
That makes sense.

159
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,640
Zheng, look at you.

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,560
We are good brothers.

Zheng is going to open the night market.

166
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,100
This is a good idea.

167
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,580
I heard that many people

168
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,550
don't close their shops at night now.

169
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,520

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,880
Let's get together more often.

195
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Here's the nutritious turtle soup.

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,700
That is a good thing.

197
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,580
It's a good thing.

198
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,260
An,

199
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,490
you should know this.

200
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,540
There are eggs too.

201
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,600
There are eggs too.

202
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,570
An,

203
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,000
it's indeed not bad.

204
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,540
An, have a bowl of soup.

205
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,750
Let me formally introduce.

206
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,320
This is Lady of the Sixth Prince,

207
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,920
Yuan Ying.

208
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,360
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

209
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,690
Brother Zheng, I want one more sweet cake.

210
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,570
Okay.

211
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,170
But this is your last piece.

212
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,930
Zai has decayed teeth.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,880
Father doesn't allow you to eat sweets.

214
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,440
Brother,

215
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,740
how did you know I have decayed teeth?

216
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,520
Mother said that

217
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,490
you didn't know things about me.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,490
She's not feeling well today.

219
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,660
So she won't come.

220
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,870
Brother Zheng,

221
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,520
it's been a long time since you last went back.

222
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,270
Let's visit Mother together sometime.

223
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
OK. I will visit her sometime.

224
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,070
Come on, Zai,

225
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,670
come here.

226
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,440
You didn't answer me just now.

227
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,300
How old are you?

228
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,670
Eat more.

229
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,690
Is Zheng going to come and

230
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,540
propose a toast?

231
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,550
Should we say something auspicious?

232
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,970
But I don't know what to say.

233
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,800
It's okay.

234
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,270
Don't be afraid.

235
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm here.

236
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,560
Let me think.

237
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,530
Come on,

238
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,120
Yan.

239
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,880
You will have your mansion together with Qi next month.

240
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
Tell me if you need any help.

241
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,450
Zheng, thank you.

242
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,720
Thank you.

243
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,600
I understand.

244
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,530
Why did you vomit?

245
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,400
Hurry up.

246
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,250
Go and have a look.

247
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,050
What's wrong?

248
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,770
It's okay.

249
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,710
-Qi. -Qi.

250
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,250
Prince Qi.

251
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,640
Qi.

252
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,400
What's wrong, Qi?

253
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,010
Qi.

254
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,030
-Qi. -Qi.

255
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,320
Call the imperial physician.

256
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,120
What's wrong?

257
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:01,830
Doctor,

258
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,540
how is he?

259
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,940
His pulse is unstable.

260
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,030
It seems that he was poisoned.

261
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,460
Poisoned?

262
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,080
He was fine just now.

263
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,200
How did he get poisoned?

264
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,670
Yes.

265
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,560
Did Prince Qi

266
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,490
eat anything special today?

267
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,280
Special?

268
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
I've been sitting beside him all night.

269
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,040
Is it because I fed him...

270
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,680
Doctor,

271
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,910
you don't know that

272
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,860
Zheng had his mansion today.

273
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,530
I was happy,

274
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,910
so I drank some more.

275
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,800
I don't think I was poisoned.

276
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,080
Just give me a prescription

277
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,060
to cure my hangover.

278
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,110
Doctor,

279
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,120
may I have a word with you?

280
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,180
We drank and ate together today.

281
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,580
Why was only Qi poisoned?

282
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,800
This is indeed strange.

283
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,750
Let me think about it.

284
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,580
Is it because I fed you

285
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,950
too much turtle soup?

286
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,460
Are you stupid?

287
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,490
You can't shoulder the responsibility

288
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,750
whether it was because of you or not.

289
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,140
If I died,

290
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,980
even if you are the princess of Danchuan,

291
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,250
you couldn't be safe.

292
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,130
Do you know it?

293
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,050
But...

294
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,010
Follow my words.

295
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,230
Follow my words.

296
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,730
Don't let the imperial physician know it.

297
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,990
Don't worry.

298
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,430
You can't be a widow

299
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,460
What are you saying?

300
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,450
Don't worry.

301
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,680
He didn't drink much.

302
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,030
How is Prince Qi?

303
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,400
He is fine,

304
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,620
but I don't know what happened to him.

305
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,200
Maybe something is wrong with the food,

306
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,870
but what we ate is all

307
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,480
the dishes on the table.

308
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,320
Yes.

309
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,290
Give me the menu today.

310
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,700
The menu.

311
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,150
There's nothing wrong with the menu.

312
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,410
This is amaranth.

313
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,440
It's Indian lettuce on the menu.

314
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,840
Originally, it was Indian lettuce,

315
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,870
but it was sold out at that time.

316
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,340
So I changed it to amaranth.

317
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,940
Amaranth?

318
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,620
It was Indian lettuce on the menu originally,

319
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,530
but it was suddenly sold out.

320
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,400
Madam said that we can change it to amaranth.

321
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,110
Madam permitted it.

322
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,940
Butler Su,

323
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,950
go check

324
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,500
if Prince Qi had amaranth

325
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,210
and then turtle soup?

326
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,670
Okay.

327
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,720
Just these two, right?

328
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,170
OK.

329
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,550
If you drink turtle soup,

330
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,680
don't eat amaranth.

331
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,490
We can't eat them together.

332
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,090
Prince Qi did drink a lot of turtle soup.

333
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,320
It's confirmed.

334
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,200
Qi did eat the turtle and amaranth.

335
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,800
The turtle and the amaranth are cold.

336
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,640
They can't be eaten together.

337
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,410
And Prince Qi must have drunk a lot,

338
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,370
so he was poisoned.

339
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,200
The antidote

340
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,650
is to make him drink a lot of water spinach juice.

341
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:04,980
Okay,

342
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,040
let me help you.

343
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,560
Your Highness,

344
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,180
Madam.

345
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,450
Help me mash these.

346
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Watch your hands.

347
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,720
How do you feel?

348
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
I...

349
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,960
am feeling better.

350
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,470
I don't feel so bad anymore.

351
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,720
It's useful.

352
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,520
Butler Su,

353
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,160
there is still some water spinach juice left.

354
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,520
If there are guests here

355
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,040
who had amaranth and turtle soup at the same time,

356
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,080
let them drink it.

357
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,590
Okay.

358
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,480
I'll arrange it now.

359
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,010
I'll arrange it right away.

360
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,450
Doctor,

361
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,670
Prince Qi is fine now.

362
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
As for what happened today, please...

363
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,450
Don't worry, Your Highness.

364
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,250
I understand.

365
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,990
Goodbye.

366
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Let me see you off.

367
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,670
Li Wei,

368
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,580
thank you.

369
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,850
I was careless this time.

370
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,590
Fortunately, you solved it.

371
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,320
The mansion banquet is tiring.

372
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,210
It's inevitable to neglect something.

373
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,440
You've done a good job.

374
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,700
Don't blame yourself.

375
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,650
By the way,

376
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,170
how did you know about

377
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,230
using water spinach juice to detoxify the poison?

378
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,230
It is not popular.

379
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,490
Li Cang was a glutton when he was little.

380
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,910
He had some amaranth at home,

381
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,520
went to the neighbor's house for turtle soup,

382
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
and got poisoned.

383
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,510
My dad used this method to save him.

384
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,410
I see.

385
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,330
Yuan Ying,

386
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,170
don't shoulder everything yourself

387
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,230
in the future.

388
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,380
I can help you to shoulder some of it too.

389
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,990
Although I'm not competent,

390
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,960
I can become mature

391
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,690
only when I have the chance to get trained.

392
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,220
How are you?

393
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,160
Are you still not feeling well?

394
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,470
Of course.

395
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,330
Where are you going?

396
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,390
I am sick like this.

397
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,800
You can't leave me alone.

398
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,530
No.

399
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,680
I just want to get some warm water from the kitchen.

400
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,600
You are sick.

401
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,230
You need to drink warm water.

402
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,880
What's wrong?

403
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,830
No. Why are you...

404
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,790
so nice to me suddenly?

405
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,730
Is getting you a cup of warm water

406
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,260
called being "nice to" you?

407
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,610
You were so rude to me.

408
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,849
I'm used to the way you used to be.

409
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,240
I...

410
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,369
Maybe I have a tendency towards masochism.

411
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,510
You don't know that

412
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,839
when I was young,

413
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,020
Brother Song and Brother Jun always bullied me.

414
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,400
Father

415
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,869
always defended them.

416
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,050
When Father saw me,

417
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,200
he would scold me, beat me, and ask me to get lost.

418
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
After a long time,

419
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,860
I'm used to it.

420
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,960
This is so unfair.

421
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,830
You can't get used to being treated like this.

422
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,790
I'm fine now.

423
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,380
They don't bully me or beat me anymore.

424
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:41,970
Well,

425
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:43,760
well,

426
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,320
it changed into you now,

427
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,740
right?

428
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Thank you for thinking for me today.

429
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,920
From now on,

430
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,240
I'll try to treat you better.

431
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,070
Thank goodness.

432
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,670
We have to keep our words.

433
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,330
You can't go back on your word.

434
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,860
I'll get you some water.

435
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,880
You must feel bad.

436
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,820
Prince Song is against you

437
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,790
and doesn't allow others to attend your mansion banquet.

438
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,980
You must be upset.

439
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,640
It's okay.

440
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,130
I can scold him for you.

441
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,720
It's nothing.

442
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm used to it.

443
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,040
How can you get used to things like this?

444
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,640
If you keep unhappy things

445
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
in heart for long,

446
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,970
you'll get sick.

447
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,060
If you don't trust others,

448
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,340
you can tell me.

449
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,650
I'll keep my mouth shut.

450
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,400
Okay.

451
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,950
You've been drinking rice soup all day,

452
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,280
but you haven't had enough.

453
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
This is rice wine.

454
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,380
You can't drink it because your stomach is weak.

455
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,320
My stomach has recovered.

456
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,680
You can't drink it anyway.

457
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,700
Can't I drink it even if my stomach has recovered?

458
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,500
No, you can't.

459
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,060
I'm not a good drinker and I can't do anything out of line.

460
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,520
Why don't you let me drink?

461
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,760
You can't do anything out of line.

462
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,680
How could you say that?

463
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,960
When we were in Danchuan,

464
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,940
you were drunk.

465
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,190
We were in the room.

466
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,230
How can you not remember

467
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,670
what you have done?

468
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,400
Danchuan...

469
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,040
Back then...

470
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,770
you were dull.

471
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,490
I was kind enough to wipe your face.

472
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,020
And then...

473
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,060
Think about it yourself.

474
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,370
See?

475
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,710
You can't drink wine.

476
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,520
You can't drink it anymore.

477
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,160
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

478
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,520
Wait.

479
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,880
Do you not want me to drink wine

480
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,670
or drink with others?

481
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,900
Hao Jia,

482
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,330
how dare you!

483
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,320
You knew that I wouldn't attend Zheng's banquet,

484
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,680
but you still insisted on going.

485
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,080
Are you embarrassing me?

486
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,720
You are wise, Your Highness.

487
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,940
I went to the banquet

488
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,570
just to chat with my friends.

489
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,030
I didn't do anything else.

490
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,340
Your Highness.

491
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,020
How many times have I told you?

492
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,420
You still insist on being close to Li Wei.

493
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,600
If you were sensible,

494
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,440
you should cut ties with her.

495
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,470
Li Wei and I are close.

496
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,280
It's just friendship.

497
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,180
We have no other intention.

498
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,020
Do you mean that

499
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,890
you want to choose her

500
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,040
and betray me?

501
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,800
I dare not.

502
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,900
Your Highness.

503
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,950
You even gave up your husband's honor

504
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,290
for the hypocritical friendship between women.

505
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,040
Have you forgotten who gave you all your clothes, food, and what you use?

506
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,900
Your Highness.

507
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,140
Your Highness.

508
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,930
Don't be angry with her.

509
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:32,940
Your Highness.

510
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,060
You are mine.

511
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,390
You must do whatever I want.

512
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,450
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

513
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,450
Please get up.

514
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,500
Your Highness.

515
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,810
Don't be angry.

516
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,680
Don't be angry with her.

517
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,290
What are you waiting for?

518
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,220
Get up.

519
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,840
You made His Highness angry.

520
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,700
Don't be stubborn.

521
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,490
Go and get on your knees.

522
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:51,970
Go!

523
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,220
Hurry up.

524
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,250
Kneel outside.

525
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,370
Zheng is really capable.

526
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,400
He held the mansion banquet.

527
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,950
Qi and Yan are idiots.

528
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,000
It's fine that they went there.

529
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
An went there too.

530
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,380
You know An.

531
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
He's profit-minded.

532
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,480
He thinks that he can reap the benefits from the night market.

533
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,410
He and Princess Yuan Ying are biologically related.

534
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,770
Maybe he's afraid to embarrass his mother's family.

535
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,840
I heard that on the engagement day,

536
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,320
Zheng was unhappy.

537
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,120
Yes.

538
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,600
He fought for his concubine.

539
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,880
But...

540
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,340
the whole mansion banquet

541
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,250
was held by Princess Yuan Ying.

542
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,010
The three of them

543
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,270
look very close.

544
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,620
They are just pretending.

545
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,880
I think he has long wanted to marry Yuan Ying.

546
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,700
Come to think of it,

547
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,160
he only went to Jinchuan once.

548
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,120
How did Zheng win the favor of Lord Jinchuan

549
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,780
who insisted on marrying his daughter to Zheng?

550
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,030
You mean that

551
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,670
when they were in Jinchuan,

552
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,640
they got united.

553
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,950
Brother Song,

554
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,740
His Majesty is always afraid of Jinchuan.

555
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,040
Whoever marries Yuan Ying

556
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,080
seems to be rich and noble,

557
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,520
but is also the easiest

558
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,170
to be undermined.

559
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,370
Now, the night market is just open.

560
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,470
Even the Ministry of Revenue is busy.

561
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,420
We have to work after curfew.

562
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,920
My subordinates are flustered.

563
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,530
They have long been dissatisfied with this matter.

564
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,590
Those officials

565
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,280
have been looking forward to Zheng stepping down.

566
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,810
Now, he even wants to expand the night market.

567
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,000
He wants a quick success.

568
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,400
He will die for it.

569
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,360
It's 9 p.m.,

570
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,960
but we are still working here.

571
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,710
How unlucky!

572
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,400
I got this job at that time

573
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,000
just because

574
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,370
this job was free.

575
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,470
But now,

576
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,280
we can't go home at night.

577
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,560
You set up a stall at night.

578
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,760
Can people in the neighborhood sleep?

579
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,690
It's stated that the night market can be open till 9 o'clock.

580
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,520
If you disagree with it, go to the government office.

581
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,320
What do you mean?

582
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,770
The old officials of the Ministry of Revenue

583
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,100
are old-fashioned.

584
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,300
The subordinates are afraid of being tired.

585
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,400
It's easy

586
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,110
to incite them.

587
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,820
Zheng wants to develop the night market.

588
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,320
It is not easy.

589
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,320
These memorials are impeaching

590
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,050
the improper management about the night market.

591
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,920
People in the Ministry of Revenue have complained about

592
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,590
many measures Daxing Night Market has taken.

593
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,540
I've told you

594
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,330
to be extremely careful

595
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,800
when you change the original market.

596
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,520
Don't take it for granted.

597
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,520
If this is

598
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,890
so easy,

599
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,500
why couldn't people do it before?

600
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,990
The Sixth Prince,

601
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,250
please think about the reasons.

602
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,340
My Lord,

603
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,320
the night market hasn't been on track yet.

604
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,230
The Ministry of Revenue has not been used to it.

605
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,090
That's normal.

606
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,460
We just need to wait a little longer...

607
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,850
If we can't comfort the ministers,

608
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,280
how can we continue?

609
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,100
Who wants to wait with you?

610
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,990
This will really affect

611
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,650
the change of the market.

612
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,990
How will My Lord calm their anger?

613
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,420
You are still young,

614
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,540
and you are not in charge of the Ministry of Revenue.

615
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,800
You are not enough to convince the public,

616
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,260
and you made a mistake because you were rash.

617
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,970
If I let you continue to manage the market,

618
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,260
I think

619
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,400
it's inappropriate.

620
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,980
You are wise.

621
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,880
Prince Zheng has a good idea,

622
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
but it's inevitable to be negligent when he brings it into force.

623
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,180
It's understandable that

624
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,630
the Ministry of Revenue is unsatisfied.

625
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,620
In my opinion,

626
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,710
at this critical moment,

627
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,130
Prince Zheng should resign.

628
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,620
You should stay away from trouble first.

629
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,090
I'm willing to be punished.

630
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,040
But changing the market

631
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,620
is right.

632
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,640
Are you crazy?

633
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,420
I gave you an out. Why are you still stubborn?

634
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,530
You made three mistakes

635
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,590
in the account of the mansion banquet.

636
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,380
What will you do in the future?

637
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,240
You need to be careful.

638
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
According to His Lordship's words,

639
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,300
the Sixth Prince disrespects His Lordship

640
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,910
and made mistakes when handling affairs.

641
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,330
His Lordship orders the Sixth Prince to reflect on his mistakes in his mansion.

642
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,680
From today onwards,

643
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,180
all the people

644
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,950
in the mansion are grounded.

645
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,810
The Sixth Prince,

646
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,810
I'm sorry for you.

647
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,040
Butler Liang,

648
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,150
what's going on?

649
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Why is our mansion

650
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,480
closed?

651
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,570
What's the matter?

652
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,430
What happened?

653
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,180
I am sorry.

654
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,790
[Small Eastern Courtyard]

655
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,840
[Seal Garden of Tranquility]

656
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,820
[Garden of Tranquility]

657
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,380
My Lord,

658
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,870
the new mansion of the Sixth Prince has been sealed.

659
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,670
Everything has been done.

660
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,450
The princes are waiting outside for the time

661
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,380
to greet My Lord.

662
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,800
I feel sorry for Zheng.

663
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,320
Actually, he didn't do anything wrong.

664
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,220
But it's not easy to innovate.

665
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,900
To continue changing the market,

666
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,720
we need to calm down those officials,

667
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,980
so that we can continue

668
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,710
in the future.

669
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,660
My Lord, you are not just a father,

670
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,790
but the chief of nine regions.

671
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,630
You need to keep a balance.

672
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,670
You are the hardest.

673
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,050
Everything is for the overall situation.

674
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,640
I think

675
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,580
the Sixth Prince will understand it.

676
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,500
At first,

677
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,770
he was the center of attention.

678
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,740
There were many hidden dangers.

679
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,310
At this critical moment,

680
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,120
I alienate him so that others can rest assured.

681
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,240
They don't need to greet me today.

682
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,060
Remind Song

683
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,410
not to come here for the time being.

684
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,240
He can't come until

685
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,240
he's done with the affairs of Ministry of Revenue.

686
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,560
Yes.

687
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,490
Your Highness, Your Highness,

688
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,090
it's been a long time since dinner time.

689
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,450
Please have some.

690
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Your Highness...

691
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,780
-Madam. -Let me do it.

692
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,080
No.

693
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,270
Madam, it's inappropriate for you to go in like this.

694
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,370
If he doesn't eat

695
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,000
and gets sick because of hunger,

696
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,240
that is called "inappropriate".

697
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,790
Yes.

698
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Thank you, Madam.

699
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,650
Your Highness,

700
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,910
Madam is going inside.

701
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,700
Eat something, OK?

702
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,540
I want to be alone.

703
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,160
I know.

704
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,310
When people are sad,

705
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,010
people don't want to eat.

706
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,970
They think that they can feel better

707
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,100
when their bodies feel bad.

708
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,370
But when I see you hungry,

709
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,020
I can't eat either.

710
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,179
When I see you unhappy,

711
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,120
I am unhappy too.

712
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,120
I don't want to see you alone.

713
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,850
I'll just stay by your side for a while.

714
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,000
OK?

715
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,580
Miss Yuan Ying has told me that

716
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,290
His Lorship

717
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,639
abandoned you

718
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,480
to calm people's resentment.

719
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,949
You did nothing wrong,

720
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,880
so don't blame yourself.

721
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,159
But if you feel bad,

722
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,000
just cry.

723
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,500
I can't see it.

724
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,310
I thought as long as I did the right things

725
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,980
and the useful things,

726
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,180
Father can support me once

727
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,850
and look at me.

728
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,000
But in the end, I thought too much.

729
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,830
But I'm used to endings like this.

730
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,370
Why are you looking at me like that?

731
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,120
If an ordinary child is wronged,

732
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,030
his parents will go to seek justice.

733
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,690
But for you,

734
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,140
the grievances are from your parents.

735
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,370
Don't get used to these.

736
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,260
If a person wants to succeed,

737
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,610
there must be many people trying to suppress him.

738
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,520
Don't get used to being wronged.

739
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,700
I don't want to see you suffer.

740
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,960
Thank you.

741
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,830
Let's eat something.

742
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,330
I asked Liu Baoquan to make some new rice cake.

743
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,760
Is it good?

744
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,940
Thank you.

745
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,210
This Silver Charcoal is too little.

746
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,910
Yes.

747
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,500
Last month, the Silver Charcoal was enough.

748
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,660
It has been much less since February.

749
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,190
Winter has passed,

750
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,040
but it's a little cold in spring lately.

751
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,760
I wonder

752
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,060
when it will warm up.

753
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,130
Butler Su,

754
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,420
these are not enough.

755
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,320
Yes.

756
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,500
Oh, yeah.

757
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,690
I saw a lot of medicines to cure a cold in the warehouse.

758
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,690
Then we won't have to fear catching a cold.

759
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,120
Moreover, I bought a lot of ginger before.

760
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,850
I'll make some ginger soup for us

761
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,310
to get rid of the coldness.

762
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,640
Then it will be fine...

763
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,000
What are you doing?

764
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,560
You...

765
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,410
irritated me.

766
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,370
I'll report it to Her Ladyship.

767
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,500
What are you growing?

768
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,560
Pakchoi.

769
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,170
Baoquan got the seeds.

770
00:37:59,450 --> 00:37:59,970
No.

771
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,080
There are wagons that carry excrement and garbage

772
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,970
going out every day.

773
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,400
So it's not difficult to ask them to sneak in some seeds.

774
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,090
Excrement...

775
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,400
They risked helping us

776
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,010
out of kindness.

777
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,380
I didn't say anything else.

778
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,280
You did.

779
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,560
The mansion is closed.

780
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,880
You still have the mood to play.

781
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,810
Come to the study for a discussion.

782
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,890
After having the mansion,

783
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,320
the things we used in the mansion

784
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,920
were sent here

785
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,840
by His Highness's villages every day.

786
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,900
And we also bought some on the street.

787
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,680
Now we are grounded to reflect.

788
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,320
We can only wait for the Ministry of Internal Affairs to allocate.

789
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,520
You must have noticed

790
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,540
the situation.

791
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,250
So we plant our own vegetables.

792
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,720
Actually, the...

793
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,930
It will be some time

794
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,810
before your vegetables grow.

795
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,770
I asked the kitchen just now.

796
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,470
Fortunately, they made pickles before the Spring Festival.

797
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,250
Yes.

798
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,520
I've specially kept radish and potherb mustard.

799
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,920
They should be enough for us to eat for half a month.

800
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,600
But I think it is not...

801
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,000
Food is easy to deal with.

802
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
The most tricky problem now is that

803
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,140
the weather hasn't warmed up yet,

804
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,070
but the charcoal is not enough.

805
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,480
I've figured out a way...

806
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,540
So, Your Highness,

807
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,190
Li Wei,

808
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,970
besides handling affairs in the mansion

809
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,330
during the time,

810
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,070
our priority

811
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,090
is to come up with a solution

812
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,570
to solve the problem.

813
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,430
Princess,

814
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,070
may I have a word with you?

815
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,530
Butler Su, add charcoal.

816
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,240
What?

817
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,270
Do you want to get by?

818
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,390
Alright.

819
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,480
It's warm now.

820
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,370
[Mingqian Hall]

821
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,380
His Lordship ordered that

822
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,260
the Fifth Prince, Yin Qi, and

823
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,120
the Seventh Prince, Yin Yan,

824
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,680
have their own new mansions

825
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,820
and join the court.

826
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,330
His Lordship hopes that you will be loyal, filial, hardworking,

827
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,700
friendly to brothers,

828
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,660
and set an example for others.

829
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,170
Thank you, Your Lordship.

830
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,790
That's great.

831
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,530
Zheng said I couldn't have my mansion.

832
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,530
I'm having it now.

833
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,050
When I am back, I will show him.

834
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,060
It is so beautiful.

835
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,940
Your carriage is not here.

836
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,290
How about this?

837
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:09,990
Get in my carriage.

838
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,190
Let me give you a ride.

839
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,080
Don't bother,

840
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,740
Brother Qi.

841
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,770
I can walk back.

842
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,750
You are crippled.

843
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,550
It'll be dark if you walk back.

844
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,320
It's not that bad.

845
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,160
What?

846
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,750
Let's go.

847
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,510
Be my guest.

848
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,210
Let's go.

849
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,600
Come on.

850
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,480
Let's go.

851
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,410
I didn't expect that

852
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,120
in a blink of an eye,

853
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,920
we would both have our mansions.

854
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:35,380
Yan,

855
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,230
are you going to hold

856
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,930
the mansion banquet?

857
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,730
I haven't decided.

858
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,040
In my opinion,

859
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,490
we must be careful.

860
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,560
Father asked us to have our mansions at this time

861
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,990
just to maintain the balance.

862
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,330
If we don't do properly,

863
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,460
we will be grounded

864
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,500
like Zheng too.

865
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,580
Brother Qi,

866
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,600
I got up too early today.

867
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,970
I want to take a nap.

868
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,170
Go to sleep.

869
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,270
Go ahead.

870
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,900
No problem. I will call you when we arrive.

871
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,160
Thank you, Brother Qi.

872
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,000
Yan, does your wife quarrel with you?

873
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,100
No, we don't quarrel.

874
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,840
That's great.

875
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,600
Okay.

876
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,490
Keep sleeping.

877
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,790
I won't talk with you.

878
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,400
I won't sleep.

879
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,330
You won't sleep.

880
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,070
Let's chat if you don't sleep.

881
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,150
I think your wife

882
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,240
is a very quiet person.

883
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,070
I'm sure she doesn't beat you.

884
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,680
You must be upset

885
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,400
because Qi and Yan have their mansions.

886
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,990
I dare not.

887
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,560
Have a seat.

888
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,870
Say what you want to say.

889
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,930
Zheng worked hard and made contributions.

890
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,320
It was acceptable for him to have his mansion

891
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,980
and attend the court earlier.

892
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,250
But Qi and Yan

893
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,130
don't have many achievements.

894
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,150
Why do they have their mansions in advance?

895
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,530
Song is the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

896
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,780
My Lord granted him a mansion after he was old enough

897
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,400
and had achieved academic excellence.

898
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,010
Do you think that

899
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,030
I'm partial?

900
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,600
As we all know,

901
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,640
My Lord has always loved Qi's mother, Madam Chun.

902
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,970
Yan has been crippled since he was a child.

903
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,170
Of course, Lord dotes on him.

904
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,560
Qi is grounded to reflect on his mistakes,

905
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,360
but he will come out eventually.

906
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,190
He's very useful.

907
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,370
He'll be Song's right-hand man.

908
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,120
But it's not good

909
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,500
for him to be over popular.

910
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,700
That's all about it.

911
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,430
Inequality rather than want

912
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,020
is the cause of trouble.
