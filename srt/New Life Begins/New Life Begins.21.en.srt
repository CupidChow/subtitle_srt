00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,680
If we can really buy Reunion Restaurant,

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,200
the wing-rooms will be renovated according to the characteristics of each region.

6
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,130
For Jichuan's room,

7
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
we'll use sky blue and bluish white.

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,710
For Jinchuan's room,

9
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,960
we'll go with gold and black.

10
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,710
Danchuan's room

11
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,340
can be painted with crimson and dark cyan.

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,170
Xinchuan's room is a difficult one.

16

Tell him I went to bed already.

17
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,180
The water hasn't been served yet.

18
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,530
And the candle is still lit.

19
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,080
He can tell you are not asleep.

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,970
So I can't go to sleep

21
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,090
if I don't wash up and blow out the candle?

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:17,980
Go.

23
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,500
I can't.

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,910
You've stayed inside all day.

25
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,750
It's time to get some fresh air.

26
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,840
It's you, Your Highness.

27
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,680

29
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,650

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,180
Go back.

32
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,630
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,730
Are you okay?

34
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,780
Actually, I'm all right.

35
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,870

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,340
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,070
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,130
I said it's not your fault.

39
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,090
But you're still angry.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,360
I just need some time.

41
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,530
Can you give me a date?

42
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,470
It's a little harsh on me.

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,310
Let's not see and talk to teach other for three days.

44
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,020
Is that okay?

45
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,090
How about two days?

46
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:12,890
No bargain.

47
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,070
OK.

50
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,360
Go get the wine.

51
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,290
Frost's Descent has left.

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,720
But the wine she made is still here.

53
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,540
Bring it here.

54
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,290
I'll drink it all up.

55
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,480
Frost's Descent doesn't know how to make wine.

56
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,270
It's White Dew who made the wine.

57
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,280
No matter who made it,

58
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,630
go bring it to me.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,730
When White Dew left,

60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,050
she got five donkey carts

61
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,690
and took all the wine away.

62
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,220
Well, why didn't you stop her?

63
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,530
The distiller's yeast was bought with my money.

64
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,990
How could they just take it away?

65
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,720
Tell me,

66
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,390
isn't everything they had,

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,870
which they ate, wore and used,

68
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,240

Well.

70

71
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,670
took the wine away.

72
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,090
They went too far.

73
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,430
Well, you can't say that.

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,140
Why can't I?

75
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,020
Are you unsatisfied with me too?

76
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,760
I think they got along well with you.

77

79
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,540
tell me now.

80
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,870
I dare not.

81
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,250
Just tell me frankly.

82
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,420
I won't blame you if you tell me.

83
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,080
I'll tell you then.

Think about it.

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,140
The girls never lived here for free.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,780
They were in charge of all the chores

89
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,210
in the mansion.

90
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,890
You could just bring a girl back.

91
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,530
But where should the girls live?

92
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,770
What's the cost of the food they eat every day?

93
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,250
And how much are their clothes?

94
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,940
There are over 20 people in the mansion.

95
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,960
Let's say one servant for each lady.

96
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,330

97
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,710

Food, clothing, housing and transportation.

99
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,330
They had to make a strict budget on everything.

100
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,600
Have you thought about these problems?

101
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,570
No.

Yes.

110

113

114
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,780

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,830
how well they can live

116
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,090

118
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,440

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,670

123
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880

139

377
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,920
It's not good for the restaurant's foothold.

378
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,890
It's more than normal for women to do business in Danchuan.

379
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,420
It's also true in Jinchuan.

380
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,160
Why should we surrender to Xinchuan's pressure?

381
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,550
Xinchuan is Xinchuan after all.

382
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,860
It's indeed a glory if it's opened by women.

383
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,480
But what I want

384
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,520
is the foundation of the restaurant to be solid.

385
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,300
Do I want the restaurant to go bankrupt?

386
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,820
I just don't understand

387
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,170
will women doing business

388
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,740
make the restaurant not last long?

389
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,440
Shangguan.

390
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,370
Yuan Ying didn't mean that

391
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,860
we can't continue our business

392
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,490
if it's run in the name of women.

393
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,860
She just wants to avoid risks.

394
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,090
Of course

395
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,970
we don't think

396
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,930
it's risky for women to do business.

397
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,710
I don't think

398
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,780
it's right to criticize women for doing business myself.

399
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,530
Yuan Ying.

400
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,040
Shangguan wasn't caring about her reputation.

401
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,390
She just thought it's unfair.

402
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,420
That's why she got so emotional.

403
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,030
All right.

404
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,450
I got it.

405
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,310
We are doing restaurant business.

406
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,290
What we are afraid of is that women doing business becomes a gimmick.

407
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,810
The most important thing is

408
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,730
if the food is good

409
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,770
and if it's worth coming here.

410
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,350
If people find out

411
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,860
the owners of this restaurant are women,

412
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,230
we are not afraid to show ourselves.

413
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,800
But if we take the initiative to show ourselves,

414
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,970
I'm afraid

415
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,950
others will think

416
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,950
we really want to use this as a gimmick on purpose.

417
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,880
Right?

418
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,770
Right?

419
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,710
Yes.

420
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,470
Sit down and have some tea.

421
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,220
-Let me fill your cup. -We are about to open.

422
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,430
Ms. Yuan Ying, please have some tea.

423
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,810
You surely know how to comfort everyone.

424
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,100
The opening is just around the corner.

425
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,660
I feel like we still have a lot to do.

426
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,750
Some items on your list

427
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,290
can wait for the time being.

428
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,400
Take a look at mine.

429
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,250
You made one too?

430
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,670
Our thoughts on planning are different.

431
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,300
Buying tablecloth

432
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,920
is a "not completed" item on my list,

433
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,950
but for you, it's marked as "can be postponed".

434
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,890
Tables without tablecloth can also be used to serve guests.

435
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,630
The tablecloth decoration

436
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,720
can be added after we make profit.

437
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,480
Here's what I think.

438
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,170
We can't finish the renovation once and for all.

439
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,500
If we make change to little details from time to time,

440
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,370
it'll be more refreshing.

441
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,810
What you think is the most important is

442
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,520
to check the menu again.

443
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,290
The restaurant is where people come to eat.

444
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,340
Of course the most important thing is whether the food is good or not.

445
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,540
You've become more and more like Lady Yuan Ying, Your Ladyship.

446
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,940
Ms. Yuan Ying taught me well.

447
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,900
I sent another invitation to invite Hao Xun today.

448
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,830
But the responses were all sent by Lady Fangru,

449
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,970
saying that Hao Jia's not feeling well

450
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,310
and shouldn't go out.

451
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
It's obviously just an excuse.

452
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,130
The root cause of their trouble

453
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,420
is Prince Song.

454
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,170
It's okay.

455
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,090
We'll figure something out.

456
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,740
About the restaurant,

457
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,580
I always wanted to save one share for Hao Jia.

458
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,920
In case

459
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,150
she can only rely on the monthly allowance given by Prince Song.

460
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,360
A man's mind is hard to read.

461
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,040
It's really unreliable.

462
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,880
[Small Eastern Courtyard]

463
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,560
After Prince Zheng finished the court meeting,

464
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,500
he found that you ladies haven't returned yet.

465
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,329
He's afraid it's not safe.

466
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,410
And he's quite worried.

467
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,790
Yes.

468
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,420
That's why he's welcoming you at the back door.

469
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,820
Butler Su.

470
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,510
Are your eyes cramping?

471
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,950
No.

472
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,160
Your Highness.

473
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,120
Watch the steps.

474
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,700
You see, the time...

475
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,770
It's not time yet.

476
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,290
We agreed not to talk for three days.

477
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,010
So I want you to allow me

478
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,720
to pull some strings.

479
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,270
I have had no appetite and my mind has been absent.

480
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,610
I can't wait for this joss stick to burn out.

481
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,830
So please make an exception, Ms. Li.

482
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,080
No.

483
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,310
Pulling strings?

484
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,890
No way.

485
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,770
We agreed that it would be three days.

486
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,150
I won't allow even the burning time of half a joss stick in advance.

487
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,770
You're walking quite fast now.

488
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,510
Can't you just hang in there for a little longer?

489
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,890
Yuping. Yuzhan.

490
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,460
Do you know how irritating Yin Zheng is?

491
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,290
He really left when I told him to.

492
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,130
I went to prepare some night snacks.

493
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,390
It's just the right time.

494
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,670
I can also bribe you.

495
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,600
Am I a pig?

496
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,730
Eating is everything for me?

497
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,920
Aren't you?

498
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,400
You...

499
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,030
You're not a pig.

500
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,600
How can you be a pig?

501
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,900
You see, the time is up.

502
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,170
Would you like to have night snacks with me?

503
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,190
I want to have some melon seeds later.

504
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:40,700
OK.

505
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,440
You need to peel 100 seeds for me.

506
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,370
I'll eat them all in one go.

507
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:43,910
Okay.

508
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,090
I also want to eat peaches,

509
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,130
but I don't want to peel them myself.

510
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,830
No problem.

511
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,230
What else do you want to eat?

512
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,310
Nice attitude.

513
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:52,880
Thank you.

514
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,380
If it weren't for my selfish intention,

515
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,680
you would have gone back to Jichuan

516
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,450
and started to live the life of

517
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,980
being the only wife and spending all your time together.

518
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,070
But I can't control things like

519
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,420
getting other concubines and serving banquets.

520
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,030
But I promise that

521
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,100
I will work hard

522
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,020
until the day when I can make the decision.

523
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,130
You are the family I met by luck.

524
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,700
So don't...

525
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,340
Don't...

526
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,990
I know Xinchuan has many problems.

527
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,630
This is what I want to change.

528
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,060
But this is a tough job.

529
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,480
Things in the court are unpredictable.

530
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,770
If anything happens to me one day,

531
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,840
-I hope I can send you back to Jichuan safely. -I want to stay here

532
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,510
and be with you.

533
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,370
I know the future will not be easy.

534
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,590
But since you made your choice,

535
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,020
you must stick to it.

536
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,080
And you can do it.

537
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,480
Me too.

538
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,690
I have something I want to do.

539
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,890
I want to open a restaurant

540
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,310
and have my own career.

541
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,680
I even want

542
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,420
to give women in Xinchuan

543
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,570
the rights to do more things.

544
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,030
Try it.

545
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,440
How do we know whether it will work if we don't try?

546
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,360
Also,

547
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,500
I know and understand

548
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,620
what you said to me.

549
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,070
I know you had no choice.

550
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,130
I just felt a little uncomfortable.

551
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,030
I didn't want to affect you with my anxious feelings.

552
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:15,750
So...

553
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,730
So I said we should take some time apart.

554
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,800
But it's fine now.

555
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,800
Don't think too much.

556
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,650
Let's eat.

557
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,280
I don't like shrimps.

558
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,820
Don't be picky with food.

559
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:51,570
Eat.

560
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,060
Good boy.

561
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,800
It's delicious.

562
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,160
Today is the opening day of Nine Regions Food Collection.

563
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,010
Everyone,

564
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,350
if you are rich, support us by eating here.

565
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,610
If you are not, support us with your presence.

566
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,990
Welcome to Nine Regions Food Collection.

567
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,860
This way please.

568
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,120
You're here.

569
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,370
[Xinchuan Danchuan Yingchuan]

570
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,730
This looks much better than the previous Reunion Restaurant.

571
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,220
Not bad.

572
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,080
It seems that it's designed by a woman.

573
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,570
Ask your boss out to see us.

574
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,770
If it really is a woman,

575
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,220
it would be so disgraceful.

576
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,470
How can a woman open a restaurant?

577
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,700
Everyone.

578
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,640
I know you are curious

579
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,710
about the ins and outs of Nine Regions Food Collection.

580
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,470
Our boss will show up sooner or later.

581
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,620
Since you are already here today,

582
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,670
why don't you take a look at

583
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,290
the dishes of Nine Regions Food Collection?

584
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm from Danchuan.

585
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,230
I never expected to see this whole collection of Danchuan cuisine

586
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,160
in Xinchuan.

587
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,920
There must be some cooks from Cangchuan, right?

588
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,930
Jerky beef pancakes.

589
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,330
You even have such an authentic dish.

590
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,820
You know the business.

591
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,080
Everyone.

592
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,690
The mushroom stew from Jichuan looks quite special.

593
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,830
Everyone.

594
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,200
We have many wing-rooms on both the first floor and the second floor.

595
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,670
They are all decorated according to each region's features.

596
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,790
If you want to have some hometown specialities,

597
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,000
or enjoy the specialities from other regions,

598
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,630
please queue up and order here.

599
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,470
Line up to get your number.

600
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,890
You'll all get it.

601
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,810
Line up.

602
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,950
Please line up.

603
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:15,850
So many people.

604
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,250
What if I can't get my number?

605
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,430
Right.

606
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,510
We have customized bowls and chopsticks according to each region's features

607
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,660
for the customers who eat in the hall.

608
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,950
If you can't get a wing-room,

609
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,410
we will gift you a pot of Danchuan's pure grain wine

610
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,290
for free.

611
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,410
Okay.

612
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,290
Line up.

613
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,510
Everyone will get it.

614
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,000
So many people are here.

615
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,410
Rumor has it that

616
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,910
this is a restaurant run by women.

617
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,060
Many people want to find out the truth.

618
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,410
If we can satisfy their appetite in the next few days,

619
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,020
the restaurant will be a success.

620
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,370
Ministry of Revenue here for investigation.

621
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,990
Prince An.

622
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,440
Someone reported that

623
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,000
Nine Regions Food Collection seems to be a restaurant,

624
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,030
but in fact,

625
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,870
the boss is doing some disgraceful business behind the curtain.

626
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,140
Today, the Ministry of Revenue is here to clear the air.

627
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,870
This place has to be thoroughly investigated.

628
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,010
Sir,

629
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,950
we're doing the restaurant business diligently.

630
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,710
We just opened today.

631
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,020
Please don't give us a hard time.

632
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
You are the bigger person here.

633
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:54,700
Wait.

634
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:55,860
Wait for what?

635
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,370
Do you want him to make a scene like this?

636
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,130
If we go down now,

637
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,910
it equals admitting that we own this restaurant.

638
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,270
Are we sure about this?

639
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,390
Since someone reported it to us,

640
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,710
the Ministry of Revenue must investigate.

641
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,430
Search!

642
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,570
You can't do this.

643
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,090
Sir.

644
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,940
Whoever comes to Nine Regions Food Collection

645
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,750
means to do disgraceful things.

646
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,200
This restaurant belongs to all of us.

647
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,260
If anything happens,

648
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,790
we will bear the consequences together.

649
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,360
Let's go.

650
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,360
Do you know

651
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,420
the owner of this restaurant is...

652
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,290
Is whom?

653
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,960
Sir, let go.

654
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:32,980
Stop.

655
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,190
There's no clause in Xinchuan Laws

656
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,840
that permits you to be violent to innocent guests.

657
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,610
Sir,

658
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,020
I don't believe you have an official document signed by the Ministry of Revenue on you.

659
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,750
But you dare to bring so many officials here

660
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
to interfere with our business.

661
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,030
Is Xinchuan's rule

662
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,700
different from Jinchuan's rule?

663
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,100
It is said that the owners of Nine Regions Food Collection are women.

664
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,380
It seems that this is not a rumor.

665
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,610
You women

666
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,980
doing business openly

667
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,480
is indeed disgraceful.

668
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,130
I...

669
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,130
I have to...

670
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,010
What do you have to do?

671
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,590
Is it in the laws that women are not allowed to do business?

672
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,160
So are you higher than the laws now?

673
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,500
You...

674
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,880
How can you do this to me?

675
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,290
Do you know you are my...

676
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,760
All the ladies running the business are decent.

677
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,820
We do our business with dignity.

678
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,530
The guests here don't know who we are.

679
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,430
If anyone thinks we are a disgrace,

680
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,310
we are the ones who will lose face.

681
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,000
It has nothing to do with others.

682
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,040
We won't report you

683
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,110
for investigating without an official document.

684
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,730
Let's each take a step back.

685
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,090
Please be a bigger person

686
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,430
and let us ladies

687
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,570
do some small business here.

688
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,960
What do you think?

689
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,430
Thank you for your inspection and supervision.

690
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,550
I hope all the guests

691
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,550
can forgive us for that scene.

692
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,190
As you can see,

693
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,710
the owners of Nine Regions Food Collection

694
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,950
are indeed us ladies.

695
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,390
Please take a look.

696
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,340
Is there anything special about us?

697
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,400
We don't have horns,

698
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,410
green faces, or buckteeth.

699
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,510
Just like the male bosses,

700
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:45,850
we each have two hands

701
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,400
to do our work with.

702
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,710
And we have our feet

703
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,340
to walk our way.

704
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,100
That's right.

705
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,850
Our food

706
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,910
is not poisonous.

707
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,430
We're not ashamed to do business.

708
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,380
We won't charge you more

709
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,480
for walking into our restaurant.

710
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,640
It's hard enough for women to do business.

711
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,330
Some nosy people

712
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,010
slandered us for illegal operation.

713
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,450
Fortunately, the officials came for investigation immediately

714
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,570
to clear our name.

715
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,690
Thank you, Ministry of Revenue,

716
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,470
for clearing Nine Regions Food Collection's name.

717
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,740
Please go to Room Xinchuan and take a rest.

718
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,250
Sir, please go upstairs.

719
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,580
The boss upstairs wants to talk to you.

720
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,720
You guys wait here.

721
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,640
Sir, this way please.

722
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,790
Sorry to have disturbed you.

723
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,070
The food and wine will be at half price today.

724
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,540
Great.

725
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,670
Please.

726
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,420
Please come in.

727
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,520
Dong Haitang.

728
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,420
Prince An.

729
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,010
We didn't make our identity public

730
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,030
because we didn't want to take advantage of your fame.

731
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,140
Of course,

732
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,350
even if we get embarrassed,

733
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,870
you won't be affected.

734
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,880
Only commoners come here to eat.

735
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,150
They only treat you as an official,

736
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,070
not as a noble prince.

737
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,850
And we didn't expose you.

738
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,120
We've done our best.

739
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
-You. -What?

740
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,960
We have done nothing wrong.

741
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,850
Please don't make trouble

742
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,710
and slander us again, Prince An.

743
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,130
Dong Haitang.

744
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,070
How dare you talk to me like this?

745
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,170
Do you know you're still my legal wife?

746
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,640
You used to depend on me.

747
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,910
Why are you staring at me like that?

748
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,780
Didn't you spend my money?

749
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,600
Fill in the amount yourself.

750
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,860
We'll return the money truthfully.

751
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,390
You...

752
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,720
How could you do this to me?

753
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,170
Stir-fry more often,

754
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,900
or it'll be burnt.

755
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:19,950
Hurry up.

756
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,970
You can put salt in it.

757
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,400
A little will suffice.

758
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,270
I heard that Prince An has come to make a scene.

759
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,360
Should I go back?

760
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,030
It's fine.

761
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,490
I'm going back anyway.

762
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,830
I'll explain it to Prince Zheng in person.

763
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,970
Was it solved?

764
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,090
What did that stupid An say?

765
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:34,990
It's solved.

766
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,530
Yuan Ying.

767
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,260
Go home first if you have things to do.

768
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,360
I have something to say to Chef Liu.

769
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,110
Jing.

770
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,570
Take this over for me.

771
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,650
From now on,

772
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,510
we'll try our best to solve the problems ourselves.

773
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,150
Don't bother Prince Zheng.

774
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:52,790
Yes.

775
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,680
I understand.

776
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:54,880
My Lady.

777
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,810
The solar term girls

778
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,820
are very quick to learn.

779
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,490
If we hire more cooks in a few days,

780
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,850
you won't need my help here.

781
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,290
I can go home and cook for you and Prince Zheng.

782
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,850
I want to recruit some more female cooks.

783
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,970
There are women in Xinchuan who need money.

784
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,810
As long as they are willing to work,

785
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,640
and they are honest people,

786
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,110
I'll let them join the restaurant.

787
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,540
Besides,

788
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,450
the cooks may have to sleep in the restaurant from time to time in the future.

789
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,790
I'm afraid it's inconvenient for me.

790
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,370
How is that inconvenient?

791
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,310
Just hire people as you want.

792
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,340
I'll be in charge of the security of this restaurant

793
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,340
in the future.

794
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,730
I'll deal with

795
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,180
those who dare to make trouble here.

796
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,010
Get back to work.

797
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,390
Yes.

798
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,730
It's burnt.

799
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,560
Hurry up and put it in the plate.

800
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,530
Look at the bird's nest.

801
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:37,770
It's so good.

802
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,770
Your cooking skills are worth a lot.

803
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,050
I think we charge them too little.

804
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,270
Ms. Yuan Ying.

805
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,140
Today's deficit is higher than expected.

806
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,960
Calm down.

807
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,230
After what Prince An did today,

808
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,600
we can only forget about the profit and treat the customers.

809
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,520
Don't worry.

810
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,960
We'll get it back.

811
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:06,790
Really?

812
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,350
Of course.

813
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,449
I've never had any losses in my business.

814
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,300
Except the time when I was forced to marry Prince Zheng.

815
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,380
You married the wrong man,

816
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,179
but it's not a loss

817
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,070
getting to know us.

818
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,280
You're right.

819
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,310
There's a silver lining.

820
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,820
Come in.

821
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:36,880
Shangguan.

822
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,010
What?

823
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:38,429
Shang...

824
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,530
Why are you

825
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:43,219
still here?

826
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,600
Why are you still here?

827
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,929
I was waiting for you to come home for dinner.

828
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,139
Why were you waiting for me?

829
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,159
What are you talking about?

830
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:51,929
Come here.

831
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,429
Let me tell you.

832
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:52,989
Come on.

833
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,440
What are you doing?

834
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,409
Come here.

835
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,120
Come here.

836
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,290
Why are you pulling me?

837
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:02,630
What are you doing?

838
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,530
Let go of me.

839
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,760
What's wrong with you?

840
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,240
Well.

841
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,110
I just want to ask you

842
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,770
if you'll come back for dinner tomorrow.

843
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,200
That depends on the situation of the restaurant.

844
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,250
Why?

845
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,340
What about the day after tomorrow?

846
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,940
That depends on the restaurant.

847
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,010
Why?

848
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,480
What about three days from now?

849
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,770
It depends on the restaurant.

850
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,200
Why do you ask?

851
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,400
Fine. Whatever.

852
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,480
I never said I have to eat with you.

853
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,360
I know.

854
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,970
What's wrong?

855
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,730
What do you mean?

856
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,290
What's wrong with you?

857
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,010
Can't you tell I was being sarcastic?

858
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,200
Do you really not care about me?

859
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,350
Well...

860
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,180
Why should I care about you?

861
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:41,990
You...

862
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,860
You have a point.

863
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,220
I just...

864
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,860
Alright, you...

865
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,470
Fine.

866
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,210
Care about him?

867
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,510
Prince Qi has been pestering you lately.

868
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,140
He's quite weird.

869
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,340
You're weird too.

870
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,660
You even asked me to eavesdrop.

871
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,490
You enjoyed it.

872
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,940
He asked me to care about him.

873
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,720
That's weird.

874
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,350
It's not weird.

875
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,780
Princess Shangguan is Prince Qi's legal wife.

876
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,920
Is it weird to want your wife

877
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,090
to care more

878
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,060
about you?

879
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,630
-Yes, very. -Yes, very.

880
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,950
Why do we find it weird?

881
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,130
Jing is such a beauty.

882
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,210
She's by Prince Qi's side.

883
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,030
It's normal for him

884
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,170
to fall in love and court her instead.

885
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,050
Courting me?

886
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,100
Makes sense.

887
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,560
I heard

888
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,950
Princess Shangguan and Prince Qi are not on good terms.

889
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,100
But it seems that you are just used to fighting with each other all the time,

890
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,150
while in fact you are quite close.

891
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,170
Close?

892
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,250
When we were in Mochuan,

893
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,590
you took the initiative to drink for him.

894
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,200
What? You don't know what happened.

895
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,430
After he got drunk that day,

896
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,500
he displayed all my weapons

897
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,560
and tried to put them to sleep.

898
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,790
And he ended up sleeping on the floor.

899
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,700
See?

900
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,390
He would rather sleep on the floor

901
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,850
to protect your weapons.

902
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,320
He must have fallen in love with you.

903
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:12,120
But it's actually hard for him to court you.

904
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,200
Jing will probably like someone

905
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,440
who can defeat her.

906
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,090
Why do I keep using the word "court"?

907
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,890
Sir, you're in the way.

908
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,920
Excuse me.

909
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:34,550
Sorry.

910
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,340
The curtain's dirty.

911
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,650
What happened?

912
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,190
Business is good.

913
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,240
Don't you have to go to court meetings every day?

914
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,130
Why are you following me all the time?

915
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,440
You have no idea.

916
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,170
Father only gave me simple tasks.

917
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,830
I don't have an official position.

918
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,680
I just do some errands with Zheng occasionally.

919
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,210
Besides, without me on court,

920
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,970
Father said the atmosphere of the imperial court

921
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,780
has become better.

922
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,010
Go on with your work.

923
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:24,590
Don't mind me.

924
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,490
The girl my mother introduced to me

925
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,630
insisted on meeting here.

926
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,410
She said the owners of this restaurant are women.

927
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,220
What?

928
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,240
Yue.

929
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,140
In my opinion,

930
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,520
why should you go on this blind date?

931
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,130
Can't you just stay at home?

932
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,890
He's still so young.

933
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,570
It's not the time for him to select women.

934
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,770
Yet he started blind dating himself.

935
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,490
You have no idea.

936
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,500
He's very anxious.

937
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,810
But the more he's like this,

938
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,760
the more he can't find a wife.

939
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,980
Like father, like son.

940
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,200
Hey.

941
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,930
Why did you drag me to hide here?

942
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,140
Can't I see him?

943
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:54,850
What?

944
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,220
Are you embarrassed that your wife

945
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,210
is opening a restaurant?

946
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,250
I didn't mean that.

947
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,710
Don't follow me.

948
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,120
Look at you.

949
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,530
I didn't do anything.

950
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,060
You...

951
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,420
Why are you all serving dishes

952
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,640
around me?

953
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,710
You are

954
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,280
from Yingchuan, right?

955
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,180
Yingchuan is good.

956
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,640
Just eat and drink as much as you want.

957
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,580
No need to be shy.

958
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,500
Just treat me

959
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,250
as an ordinary person.

960
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,960
My mother said

961
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,220
I should find someone older than me

962
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,640
who is mature and reliable to take care of me.

963
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,510
But at your age,

964
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,650
you want to come into the restaurant opened by women.

965
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,790
Do you not want to do something like this too?

966
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,590
I just think

967
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,710
this place is safer for women.

968
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,960
How do you know so well?

969
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,410
Do you come out often?

970
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,090
My goodness.

971
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,840
This is not good.

972
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,780
Let me tell you.

973
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,350
Especially girls like my Fifth Sister-in-law from Danchuan,

974
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,050
who shows her face in public every day

975
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,170
are not good girls.

976
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,410
Sister Shangguan.

977
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,550
Move aside.

978
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,000
Sister Shangguan.

979
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,530
It's really you.

980
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,990
I thought I was mistaken.

981
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,490
Well, Sister Shangguan.

982
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,050
How could you come out

983
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,950
without a servant by your side?

984
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,420
If you have an affair,

985
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,890
no one can stop you.

986
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:26,810
Prince Yue.

987
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,900
If you see me, just let it go.

988
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,280
No need to say hello next time.

989
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,170
And no need to talk nonsense.

990
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,660
Hey.

991
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,810
It is for your own good, Sister Shangguan.

992
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,210
Listen.

993
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,390
Sister Shangguan.

994
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,070
Although you're from Danchuan,

995
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,800
you've married into Xinchuan,

996
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,330
right?

997
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,960
You have to follow the rules.

998
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,130
You can't always wander around

999
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,880
with your spear.

1000
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,060
This is inappropriate.

1001
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,410
Even if you don't feel ashamed,

1002
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,170
I feel ashamed for my fifth brother.

1003
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,920
Yue.

1004
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,050
What are you talking about?

1005
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,720
Why should she be ashamed?

1006
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,130
I think you should be ashamed.

1007
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,480
Let me tell you.

1008
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,650
Shangguan is the boss of this restaurant,

1009
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,180
and also the princess of Danchuan.

1010
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,760
Who are you to talk nonsense here?

1011
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,750
Boss?

1012
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,150
So she is the female boss of this restaurant?

1013
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,380
Qi, are you crazy?

1014
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,350
Come on, listen to me.

1015
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,010
Let go.

1016
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,730
No wonder people outside are saying

1017
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,170
you can't tame the horse of Danchuan.

1018
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,330
You didn't carry out a husband's duty.

1019
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,290
How can you let a woman out to do business?

1020
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,250
You are a disgrace to Xinchuan.

1021
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,040
Do you know that?

1022
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,980
Why are you yelling?

1023
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,290
Why are you yelling?

1024
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,620
I'm telling you now.

1025
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,080
From now on,

1026
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,520
show some respect to my wife.

1027
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,090
Do you hear me?

1028
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,660
I respect her?

1029
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,300
Why should I respect her?

1030
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,840
Do you know what people say about this restaurant?

1031
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,410
Women have usurped men's power.

1032
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,750
Serving people with sexual charms.

1033
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,330
The horse of yours

1034
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,990
is shameless and despicable.

1035
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,600
I didn't expect

1036
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,030
you couldn't even beat Yue.

1037
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,640
What?

1038
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,290
It's because I slipped.

1039
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,470
My shoes slipped off my feet.

1040
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,330
If we fight again,

1041
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,080
I'll beat him to death.

1042
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,990
Cut the crap.

1043
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,030
It hurts.

1044
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,200
Didn't you say I embarrassed you because I opened a restaurant?

1045
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,080
Why did you stand up for me?

1046
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,500
I swear I never thought that way.

1047
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,850
I just thought

1048
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,660
others would talk.

1049
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,240
The less trouble, the better.

1050
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,570
Besides,

1051
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,570
I'll always support you no matter what you do.

1052
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,570
Why?

1053
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,770
There's no why.

1054
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,890
It's just I...

1055
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,400
I want to make you happy.

1056
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,330
What?

1057
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,900
Well,

1058
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,470
I want to make you happy.

1059
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,800
I want to treat you well

1060
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,160
and make you happy.

1061
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,490
You're alone in Xinchuan.

1062
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,840
You don't even have anyone to protect you.

1063
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,780
Of course, I know.

1064
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,380
I know you're strong.

1065
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,590
But I thought

1066
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,290
I can protect you

1067
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,150
from time to time

1068
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,760
and make you happy once in a while.

1069
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,410
It hurts.

1070
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,880
It hurts more than the egg rolling.

1071
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,690
Go back and rest.

1072
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,180
I'll go then.

1073
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,060
Come protect me when you're better.

1074
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:08,690
What?

1075
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,270
You don't want to?

1076
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,730
I do.

1077
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,320
Of course I do.

1078
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,290
It's a deal.

1079
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,240
I'll do anything for you.

1080
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:19,740
Keep packing.

1081
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,050
I'm going back.

1082
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,020
I'm leaving.

1083
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,870
Jing will probably like someone

1084
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,070
who can defeat her.

1085
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,500
Not necessarily.

1086
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:13,660
♫The weather is cool, the clouds are light♫

1087
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,880
