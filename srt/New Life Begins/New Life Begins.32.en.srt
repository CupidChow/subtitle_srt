Jinchuan's trade

5
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,850
has always been more mature than Xinchuan's.

6
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,880
Xinchuan wants to reduce each other's taxes.

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,970
It's a loss for us.

8
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,130
In my opinion,

9
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,090
not only can we not agree,

10
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,950
but we also have to add additional taxes

11
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,320
to Xinchuan in the future.

12
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,920
Fool!

13
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,310
Xinchuan is different now.

14
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,580
In the past,

15
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,530
no one compares with Jinchuan in terms of business.

16
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,300
But now,

17
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,120
the business between other regions and Xinchuan is getting more frequent.

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,280
But you still proposed to increase taxes.

19
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,350
As the supervisor,

20
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,200
you idle around and neglect your work.

21
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,130
Do you really think it's that easy to be a supervisor?

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,530
Jinchuan relies heavily on the trade with other regions.

24
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,660
If we reduced taxes,

25
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,600
although there is a possibility of dumping,

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,730
it can promote the reform in Jinchuan.

27
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,670
Reducing taxes

28
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,750
may let Jinchuan people see

29
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,380
how other regions do business,

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,860
and then promote the reform in Jinchuan.

32
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,450
Why did you suddenly talk about politics today?

33
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,510
I was talking nonsense.

34
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,730
Your Highness,

35
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,970
please pretend you never heard my humble opinion.

36
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,650
Well...

37
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,350
It makes sense.

38
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,770
Your mother could think of it.

39
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,230
Why didn't you think of it?

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,980
Father,

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,520
what else does Jinchuan need to learn from other regions?

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,620
In terms of business,

43
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,960
it is always other regions that learn from us.

44
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,720
Actually,

45
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,820
we can learn a lot from Xinchuan.

46
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,710
In the past, Xinchuan was subject to us in the way of doing business.

47
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,290
But now,

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,870
they reformed the precinct-market system.

49
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,440
Now, Xinchuan has the potential to surpass us.

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
If Jinchuan is complacent and conservative,

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,170
it will definitely fall behind Xinchuan.

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,680
This is also

53
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,010
right.

54
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,010

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800

Let's hear it all.

58
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,010
Actually,

59
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,070
Ying thought of all these.

60
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,910
She has many ideas.

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,839
You did it on purpose.

Why are you defending her too?

64
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
She always wants to get involved in men's affairs.

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,640
Aren't you

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,310
encouraging her?

67
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,520
Didn't your father just say

68
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,960
these are good ideas?

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,770
They're good for Jinchuan.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,430
Does it matter

71
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,010
if they're proposed by a man or a woman?

72
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,340
They're good as long as they're feasible.

73
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,680
I think Ying is right.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She is excellent.

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,760
If you give her a chance,

76
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,390
she can do better.

77
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,050
Please,

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,159
take a look at what Ying wrote.

79
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,130
In the past,

80
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,800
Ying said she wanted to be a female official.

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,170
You didn't trust her.

82
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,600
But what she wrote proves that

83
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,370
our daughter is indeed capable of becoming an official.

84
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,700
-Mother. -You be quiet.

85
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,860
Anyone who knows her

86
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,820
acknowledged her

87
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,540
and praised her.

88
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,690
But only her closest relatives rejected her.

89
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,920
Ying must be so sad.

90
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,380
Your Highness.

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,060
It might not be too hard

92
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,690
to acknowledge her.

93
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,340
Understood.

94
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,310
You may leave.

95
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,350
Let me think about it.

96
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,730
Fortunately,

97
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,580
I memorized them all.

98
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:41,700
All right.

99
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,060
OK.

100
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,350
OK.

101
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,850
I want another one of these.

102
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,200
OK.

103
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,330
Just bring another one of those.

104
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:46,710
OK.

105
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,590
OK.

106
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,270

Danchuan food is indeed delicious.

111
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,670
Try it.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,460

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,370
-I have something to tell you. -No.

114
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,200
This thing...

115
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,230
I'm telling you. It's delicious.

116
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,830
I have something to tell you.

117
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:19,860
Go ahead.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
Actually, I have you in my heart.

119
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,090
Breathe.

Shangguan.

121
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,909
Sir and Madam,

122
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,159
would you like it slightly spicy or moderately spicy?

123
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,909
We want it sweet.

124
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,920
Shangguan.

125
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,120
Actually,

126
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,190
why didn't you tell me earlier that you have me in your heart?

127
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,520
I have feelings for you.

128
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,310
I'm just...

129
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,090
I'm not sure.

130
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,640
Because you know,

131
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,510
no girl liked me since I was little.

132
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,140
So sometimes I wonder

133
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,640
which blind girl

134
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,260
would like a dumbass like me?

135
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,380
No, I was not talking about you.

136
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,320
You're not blind.

137
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
You're the best person in the world.

138
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,929
I do have you in my heart.

139
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,030
But

140
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,290
we are not suitable for each other.

141
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,390
Why?

142
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,160
The reason we think we like each other

143
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,920
is because we've never been together with anyone else.

144
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,180
We have no experience.

145
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,990
We've been tied together.

146
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,680
As time passed, we had hallucinations.

147
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,750
But it's not true love.

148
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,440
No, how can you say it's not true love?

149
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
I've really thought about it.

150
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,990
I just want to be with you

151
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,580
forever and ever.

152
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,420
But I don't want to.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
When we were in Xinchuan,

154
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,020
we've been changing ourselves to adapt to each other.

155
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,620
I don't want to change myself

156
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,350
just because I like someone.

157
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,180
I won't tie you down.

158
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,100
I can give you the freedom you want.

159
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,230
But when you choose to be with someone,

160
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,350
you have to be considerate of him, right?

161
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,070
No.

162
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
You don't need to.

163
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,070
I'll do it.

164
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Just be yourself.

165
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,520
Can't you just leave them to me?

166
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,580
I don't want you to make compromises.

167
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,900
You like sweet food,

168
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,280
but you have to eat spicy food for me.

169
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,830
Now,

170
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,430
you're living on the streets with me.

171
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,710
It makes me really sad.

172
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,320
This is not what you want,

173
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,520
or what I want.

174
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,710
Don't change yourself for others.

175
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,450
But I really...

176
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,420
I really like you.

177
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,890
I don't think it's difficult.

178
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,530
I'm used to it.

179
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,360
I've made up my mind.

180
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,850
Let's part here.

181
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,550
Go find someone you really like.

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,410
If it's fate,

183
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,790
we will meet again.

184
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,070
I'll go get the horse.

185
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,220
Shangguan.

186
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,730
His Majesty asked my sister to discuss with us

187
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,230
the reduction of taxes.

188
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,120
But you know

189
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,980
what to do, right?

190
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,570
Only by following me

191
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,350
will you have your future glory and wealth.

192
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,090
Understand?

193
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,560
Yes.

194
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,210
You're already thinking about the future?

195
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,690
You were released so soon.

196
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,230
If I don't come out,

197
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,190
who knows how you'd drive Jinchuan into the ground.

198
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,360
How dare you bring outsiders

199
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
to discuss the affairs of Jinchuan?

200
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,000
Since I'm working in the Nine Regions Affairs Division of Xinchuan,

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,990
based on the peace alliance of the nine regions,

202
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,700
I have the right to discuss

203
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,610
the tax reduction with you.

204
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,840
Princess,

205
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,190
how can you convince us

206
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,880
if you only rely on the help of your husband from another region?

207
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,160
He's a prince but not my husband.

208
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,120
We're no longer married.

209
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,860
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

210
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,690
I didn't invited him here today

211
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,820
to be my backup.

212
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,460
I wanted to show him that

213
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,880
Jinchuan is also reforming.

214
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,180
In the future,

215
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,270
we'll still be the most powerful ally of Xinchuan.

216
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,260
If you have any questions,

217
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
I can answer them.

218
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,760
All of you are the pillars of the Ministry of Revenue.

219
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,820
You have sharp eyes and nimble ideas.

220
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,850
You must know better than me

221
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,200
where the future of Jinchuan lies.

222
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,870
Your Highness.

223
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,660
Ying can do it.

224
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,690
Crab

225
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,710
is cold in nature.

226
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,580
So eat more to relieve your internal heat.

227
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,600
Don't worry too much.

228
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,390
The Lord has released you.

229
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,120
It means there's still room to turn things around.

230
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,250
Let's take our time.

231
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,180
There must be a way to persuade him.

232
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,320
I just don't understand.

233
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,490
I have proved to Father that

234
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,980
I can be useful on things

235
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,180
other than marriage.

236
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,800
It's clear that

237
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,340
the relationship between the two regions will not change.

238
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,260
Why did he still refuse on the divorce?

239
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,110
Perhaps Lord Jinchuan has other concerns.

240
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,130
Lord Jinchuan is here.

241
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,730
Rise.

242
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,740
I'm here to see you.

243
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,110
Sit.

244
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,740
No need.

245
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,520
I've eaten.

246
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,450
You eat.

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,310
Sit.

248
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,180
You did a good job today.

249
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,920
The old opinionated officials of the Ministry of Revenue

250
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
praised you.

251
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,830
They've never praised Yuan Xu like this.

252
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,450
Eat up.

253
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:38,910
Yes.

254
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,730
Lord Jinchuan.

255
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,520
I have something to tell you.

256
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,710
The Princess is the bravest person.

257
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,100
But now she is so cautious.

258
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,040
Because she wants your approval too much.

259
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm from a humble family,

260
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,370
but I am happy.

261
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,240
Because my parents treated me well.

262
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,580
They understand and tolerate me.

263
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,360
I guess that's what the Princess wants too.

264
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,810
Prince Zheng.

265
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,460
Is she the person you care about the most?

266
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,620
Now I understand why you like her.

267
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,000
But since my daughter is married to you,

268
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
you can't just separate at will.

269
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,240
Father.

270
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,550
No means no.

271
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,020
Have you thought about

272
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,980
how to remarry after the divorce?

273
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,030
If you stay at home,

274
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,130
are you going to be alone for the rest of your life?

275
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,210
Why do I have to remarry?

276
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,000
To gain more benefits?

277
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,120
I have proved to you

278
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,450
that I can work for the Ministry of Revenue.

279
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,360
Why do you still insist on doing this?

280
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,260
Ridiculous!

281
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,270
Do you know

282
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,200
what it means to a woman

283
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,260
is she's divorced?

284
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,830
I don't care.

285
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,220
I just want to live the life I want.

286
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,540
Even if I were to be condemned by the public,

287
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,620
I'm not afraid.

288
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,520
You...

289
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,010
Actually, what the Lord is concerned about

290
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
is the future of Princess Yuan Ying.

291
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,480
You keep asking her

292
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,640
if she really wants

293
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,590
to be alone

294
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,330
for the rest of her life.

295
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,100
If you're really waiting for the highest offer,

296
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,020
you wouldn't have asked these questions.

297
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,080
You are obviously worried about her future.

298
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,740
You don't care about the relationship between the two regions either.

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,260
From beginning to end,

300
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,590
you only care about your daughter's happiness.

301
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,730
The reason you didn't agree

302
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,869
is not because of profit,

303
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,050
but out of love.

304
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,720
This is a wild guess.

305
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:26,660
Lord.

306
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,690
Princess was seriously ill in Xinchuan.

307
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,060
She almost died.

308
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:33,870
What?

309
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,070
Li Wei.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
Don't worry too much.

311
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,270
I'm fine now.

312
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,410
But as you know,

313
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,490
she has always been eager to excel.

314
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,480
She needed to manage internal affairs

315
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,890
and the business outside.

316
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,940
She dared not slack off at all.

317
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,080
She was so tired that her old illness relapsed.

318
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,070
But she handled everything well.

319
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,160
She is destined for great things.

320
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,740
Why should she be trapped by the trivialities of the inner courtyard?

321
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,110
Please give her a chance.

322
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,560
She can do it well.

323
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,720
Let's part here.

324
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,630
See you.

325
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,470
See you.

326
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,230
You said you didn't need me.

327
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,050
What a huge

328
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,460
idiot.

329
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,030
Sleeping in a tent is better than sleeping here.

330
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,360
Come out now.

331
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,340
I know it's you.

332
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:08,650
Help me.

333
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,080
Lend me a hand.

334
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,080
Hurry.

335
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,690
You've been following me all the way.

336
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,490
Are you tired?

337
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,850
You...

338
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,630
When did you find me?

339
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,240
Don't go.

340
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,280
Let me ask you.

341
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,360
Haven't you thought about me

342
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,820
since we parted?

343
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,310
If you say yes,

344
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,130
I'll leave tomorrow morning.

345
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,190
Yes.

346
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,630
I don't believe it.

347
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,630
It's not up to you.

348
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,280
How can you break your word?

349
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,880
You lied to me. Stop pretending.

350
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,670
I saw it when we parted.

351
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,720
You turned your head.

352
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,180
You don't want to leave me.

353
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,500
Shangguan.

354
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,500
Shangguan.

355
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:08,660
That day,

356
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,380
I thought a lot about what you said.

357
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,370
You said

358
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,120
we have to do what we really want to do.

359
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,460
What I really want to do

360
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,580
is to be with you.

361
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,910
Listen.

362
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,460
You can't drive me away.

363
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,520
I've made up my mind.

364
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,320
I'll follow you wherever you go.

365
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,500
You know nothing.

366
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,080
I know nothing?

367
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,600
You got it wrong.

368
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,610
I know a lot.

369
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,840
I can definitely help you.

370
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,880
Maybe one day,

371
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,360
you'll beg me for help.

372
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,260
Fine.

373
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,620
Let's stop talking.

374
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,520
Let's go to bed.

375
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,970
Stop thinking about it.

376
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,130
Come out.

377
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,940
Aren't we sleeping?

378
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,140
That's where I sleep.

379
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,730
Fine.

380
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,370
I deserve it.

381
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,640
Why is Father here?

382
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,700
You haven't eaten yet.

383
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,160
You have the same problem as me.

384
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,090
You forget to eat when you're busy.

385
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,380
Come, sit.

386
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,340
Sit.

387
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,530
Have some soup.

388
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,980
What's wrong?

389
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,250
Do you want me to issue an edict?

390
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,020
About the divorce,

391
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,700
I only thought about the difficulties you might face in the future,

392
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,230
but ignored your feelings.

393
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,040
I

394
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,670
apologize to you.

395
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,200
Father.

396
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,560
Since you've made up your mind,

397
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
it's up to you.

398
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,740
Thank you, Father.

399
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,770
I've never seen you smile so happily.

400
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,270
Sit.

401
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,830
I know

402
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,440
I let you down this time.

403
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,050
I will do my best

404
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,510
to share your burden.

405
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,080
Prince Zheng and you

406
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,220
thought of so many ways to persuade me.

407
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,170
In your heart,

408
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,680
am I really a father who only cares about interests

409
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,080
but doesn't care about his daughter at all?

410
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,810
That's not what I meant.

411
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,830
I know

412
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,960
you are different from ordinary women.

413
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,030
But you are a girl after all.

414
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,220
If you were to compete with a man,

415
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,530
there will be a lot of criticisms.

416
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,710
Are you strong enough to bear them?

417
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,260
No father wants his daughter

418
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,140
to follow his suit

419
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,290
to work hard outside.

420
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,620
I just want you to be

421
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,350
safe

422
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,840
and happy.

423
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,780
Why haven't you

424
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,740
told me these things before?

425
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,440
I know

426
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,810
my daughter is not a flower that clings to others,

427
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
but a phoenix that can fly to the sky.

428
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:35,890
From now on,

429
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,080
I won't stop you anymore.

430
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,730
Just do what you want.

431
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,360
All right.

432
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,310
Stop crying.

433
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,240
Let's eat.

434
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,610
Have some crabs.

435
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,900
Have you forgotten?

436
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,080
I can't eat cold-natured food.

437
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,020
You eat it.

438
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,270
But don't eat too much.

439
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,400
It's cold in nature.

440
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,700
It's not good to eat too much.

441
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,900
Let me open it for you.

442
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,810
There are so many crab roes.

443
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,490
Eat up.

444
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,230
Coming.

445
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,880
Lady Wei,

446
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,240
these are the crabs you asked the chef to cook.

447
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,170
I smelled them.

448
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,540
They're really fresh.

449
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,570
Thank you.

450
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,320
You're welcome.

451
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,290
Let's eat together.

452
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,290
Help yourselves.

453
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,040
Come on.

454
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,030
Have a seat.

455
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,010
This is a Yingchuan specialty made of fish.

456
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,070
Because it's fish,

457
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,250
it's warm in nature.

458
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,510
It's OK if you eat a lot.

459
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,690
Let's eat.

460
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,290
Prince.

461
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,330
Is it delicious?

462
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,590
At first, I wanted to bribe the chef with money.

463
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,940
But he refused to do it.

464
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,470
He said he couldn't do it.

465
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,430
Then I said

466
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,420
chefs in Xinchuan could do it,

467
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,460
he immediately brought it out.

468
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,240
You have a way with

469
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,460
chefs of Jinchuan.

470
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,210
Thank you.

471
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,430
Not only that,

472
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,230
there are many things

473
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,310
I have to thank you for.

474
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,410
Here.

475
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,160
To you.

476
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,250
To you.

477
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,360
Without your help,

478
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,080
Father wouldn't have agreed to this divorce.

479
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,440
Come.

480
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,180
Let's celebrate our divorce.

481
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,890
When you have children,

482
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,190
I'll be their godmother.

483
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,790
Of course.

484
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,810
It's still early.

485
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,600
It's not.

486
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,400
They will come.

487
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,390
I will push them.

488
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,640
Yuan Ying,

489
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,320
will you be in charge of the Ministry of Revenue

490
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,580
now that you will be staying in Jinchuan?

491
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,030
It seems I have to work hard.

492
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,430
I can't lose to the Ministry of Revenue of Xinchuan.

493
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,510
Then you'll become a female official.

494
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,710
The first female official in Jinchuan.

495
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,420
Hope our cooperation in the future will go smoothly.

496
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,410
I look forward to working with you.

497
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,050
Let me make it clear.

498
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,760
Please treat Li Wei well.

499
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,260
If you treat her badly,

500
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,890
I might pick a fight with you.

501
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:27,990
Yes.

502
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,260
I have a friend in high places!

503
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,520
It's on the house.

504
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,090
Enjoy.

505
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,980
People running restaurants here are working so hard.

506
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,020
If a Nine Regions Food Collection is open here,

507
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,890
we might be surpassed.

508
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
Princess is in charge of

509
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,640
the Nine Regions Food Collection in Jinchuan.

510
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,700
You will be rivals.

511
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,070
No, I'll go work hard now.

512
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,040
Where are you going?

513
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,700
I'm going to check out Jinchuan's restaurants.

514
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,500
Lady Wei.

515
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,290
Wait for us.

516
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,470
Even Li Wei is working hard now.

517
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,020
Lady Wei is becoming more and more like Princess Yuan Ying.

518
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,040
Come.

519
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,670
Let's have a drink.

520
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,420
[Commandments for Women, Admonishments for Women]

521
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,780
I hope you can read a lot of books

522
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,190
and not be restricted by the rules.

523
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Madam Jinchuan asked me to give you this.

524
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,000
The official robe and cap for the first female official in Jinchuan.

525
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,420
I remember you said in the Garden of Tranquility that

526
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,440
you wanted to be stronger

527
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,640
and make everyone feel free.

528
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,670
I know.

529
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
Because you said it,

530
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,420
it can be done.

531
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,410
This is just the first step.

532
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,540
Your wish will come true in the future.

533
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,920
Thank you.

534
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,930
You're leaving tomorrow.

535
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:41,710
Today,

536
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,900
we'll have the last lesson.

537
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,480
Yes.

538
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,050
Ms. Yuan Ying, I'm all ears.

539
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,540
At the Garden of Tranquility,

540
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,940
you told me that

541
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,510
you don't have any noble ideals.

542
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
You just want to be yourself,

543
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,360
live a free life

544
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,670
and protect the people you want to protect.

545
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,320
Now,

546
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,090
is it still the same?

547
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,360
Yes.

548
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,540
My heart hasn't changed.

549
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,390
But now,

550
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,500
I want to be like you,

551
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,380
someone who can change the rules,

552
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,860
protect others

553
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,350
and make the world better.

554
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,160
You can do everything well independently now,

555
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,230
whether you're in the mansion

556
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,430
or in the restaurant.

557
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,610
I don't need to teach you anything anymore.

558
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
You've graduated today.

559
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,910
I'll give you ten points.

560
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,540
Congratulations.

561
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,410
You've graduated.

562
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,330
All good things come to an end.

563
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,980
You have to face things alone in the future.

564
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,110
Don't embarrass me.

565
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,950
If you are really in trouble,

566
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,560
you must remember to

567
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,130
write to me.

568
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,030
I graduated today.

569
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,350
Ms. Yuan Ying graduated as well.

570
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,340
Please sign this letter of guarantee

571
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,380

I, Princess Yuan Ying of Jinchuan,

575
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,420
voluntarily promise Li Wei from Jichuan that

576
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,320
I'll eat on time,

577
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,890
sleep for eight hours a day

578
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,110
and rest for at least three days a month.

579
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,540
I'll exercise regularly.

580
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,320
If I'm sick, I'll go to the doctor in time

581
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,230
and take the medicine on time

582
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,890
with no delay.

583
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,420
Lord Jinchuan and Madam Jinchuan have signed it.

584
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,550

[Guarantor]

587
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,070
Seal it.

588
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:49,739
All right.

589
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,370
Let's part here.

590
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,320
You've signed the letter of guarantee.

591
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,050
You must fulfill it.

592
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,020
No cheating.

593
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,910
Your mother will write to me.

594
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,720
Don't worry.

595
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,140
Yuan Ying.

596
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,210
From now on,

597
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,700
just be yourself.

598
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,230
You should know that I have your back.

599
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,030
No one dares to bully you.

600
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
You must always be

601
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,940
healthy

602
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,210
and happy.

603
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,380
You too.

604
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,000
Take care.

605
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,840
Take good care of her.

606
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,680
You should know that

607
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,840
I have her back.

608
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,480
If you dare to bully her,

609
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,560
I will go back

610
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,490
and take revenge on you.

611
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,170
Don't worry, Princess.

612
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:03,610
I will.

613
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,200
Take care.

614
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,720
Li Wei, your student,

615
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,450
bid farewell to Ms. Yuan Ying.

616
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,560
Take care.

617
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,590
Prince Zheng is here.

618
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

619
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,410
You're back.

620
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,440
I received a letter from Lord Jinchuan.

621
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,180
Since he agreed to your divorce,

622
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,970
I won't ask any more questions.

623
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

624
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,020
Many officials impeached you

625
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,280
on your divorce.

626
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,440
For the sake of public opinion,

627
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,570
I have to punish you.

628
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,440
Your punishment is to reflect on yourself at the ancestral temple.

629
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,140
Do you accept the punishment?

630
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,740
Yes.

631
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,400
Thank you for your leniency.

632
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,040
Report to the Nine Regions Affairs Division as soon as you're done.

633
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,430
Yes.

634
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,270
You want to promote Li Wei from Jichuan to your legal wife, right?

635
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,750
Yes.

636
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,540
I'll give you permission on this too.

637
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,410
But it's not the time to make it public.

638
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,490
We'll talk about the canonization ceremony later.

639
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,840
Thank you, Father.

640
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,070
Prince An and Prince Jun are here.

641
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,470
Greetings, my Lord.

642
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,980
I asked you here to announce something.

643
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,230
Zheng is also here.

644
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,890
Recently,

645
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,900
An managed the Ministry of Revenue alone

646
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,100
and encountered a lot of trouble.

647
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,050
These old ministers are really hard to deal with.

648
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:15,050
Thanks to Jun, things were settled.

649
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,320
There are numerous and diverse affairs at the Ministry of Revenue.

650
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,360
It seems that more help is needed.

651
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,070
I want to send Jun over

652
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,570
to train with you.

653
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,960
What do you think?

654
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,860
I think it's good.

655
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,070
Good.

656
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,230
Thank you, Brother An.

657
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,970
I will do my best

658
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,600
to manage the Ministry of Revenue with you.

659
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,220
OK.

660
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,040
It's settled then.

661
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,000
Yes.

662
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,420
Brother An.

663
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,740
Brother Zheng.

664
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,970
Please look after me in the future.

665
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,860
We're family.

666
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,680
We should support each other

667
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,880
and serve the people.

668
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,620
Brother An.

669
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,530
It's not easy to deal with the senior ministers Song left in the Ministry of Revenue.

670
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,590
You were not there.

671
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,730
So I asked Jun for help.

672
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
But why did father

673
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,520
name him the associate assistant of the Ministry of Revenue?

674
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,180
The title should be given it to you.

675
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,240
Brother An, please watch your mouth.

676
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Are you afraid that one side will beat the other side,

677
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,180
while you stood on the wrong side?

678
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,010
Save it.

679
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,250
You still have the mood to tease me?

680
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,360
I've invested in the Women's Chamber of Commerce.

681
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,280
Now everyone knows that

682
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,540
we're on the same side.

683
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,640
What are you worried about then?

684
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,900
I'm worried about you.

685
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,430
Now that Jun got promoted,

686
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,430
it will be hard for you in the future.

687
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,740
He went to the Ministry of Revenue.

688
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,080
You should worry about him.

689
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,810
What should I be worried about?

690
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,450
No.

691
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,160
He didn't come for me.

692
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,640
He'll only try hard to makes contributions.

693
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,780
The more he cares about

694
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,310
his work,

695
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,140
the more I feel at ease.

696
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,560
But you.

697
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,110
He looks nice now.

698
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,200
He'll play dirty tricks behind your back.

699
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,140
Can you handle it?
