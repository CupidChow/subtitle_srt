[Prison]

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,530
Who is it?

6
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,229
It's Lady Jing.

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,460
Lady!

8
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,620
Move!

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm here to save someone.

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,729
I don't want to hurt anyone.

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,850
Lady.

12
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,600
Madam He is here.

13
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,140
Shangguan.

14
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,200
Stop fighting!

15
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,370
Why are you here?

16
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
Madam He is here.

17
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
Put down your knives.

18
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,970
Who allowed you to point your knives at the Princess of Danchuan?

19
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,000
Lord Xinchuan has sentenced Yin Qi to death.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,260
I have to take him away.

21
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,640
Watch your mouth, Princess.

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,329
Calm down.

23
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,050
His Majesty would never give such an order.

24
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,700
Caring too much is a taboo when facing the enemy.

25
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,560
Think about it.

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,740
Did you fall into someone's trap?

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,720
Qi committed a capital crime this time.

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,040
It was Zheng's fault.

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,770
Zheng is fine now.

30
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,650
But Qi ended up like this.

31
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,030
The Princess is just worried about Prince Qi.

32
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,530
She doesn't want to make trouble.

33
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,400
No one is allowed to talk about

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,890
what happened today.

35
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,600
Understand?

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,240
Yes.

37
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,840
Madam Chun will explain to His Highness tomorrow.

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,570
Don't worry.

39
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,590
My Lord.

40
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,870
Have some tea.

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,370
How long has she been waiting outside?

42
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,630
Your Highness,

43
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,300
it's been four hours.

44
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,150
Let her in.

45
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:52,880
Yes.

46
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,680
Madam Chun.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,660
Please.

48
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,500
I didn't teach my son well.

49
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,079
I'm willing to bear the consequence for him.

50
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,200
Please punish me.

51
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,490
It has nothing to do with you.

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,780
No.

53
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,560
It's my fault.

54
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,110
I failed to teach my son well.

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,930
If he had been closer to you,

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,900
you would understand him better.

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,630
You mean

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,500
I don't know him yet?

59
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,870
On the contrary,

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,870
I know him too well.

61
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,230
He's not smart, why would he interfere in this matter?

62
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,240
All these years of training have been in vain.

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,320
In this situation,

64
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,970
he acted impetuously.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,430
He questioned me

66
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,630
and talked back to me.

67
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,460
I didn't know

68
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,550
I had such a rebellious son.

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,420
He just didn't

70
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,270
treat his father,

71
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,480
the Lord,

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,110
with respect.

73
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,100
Yin Qi will never disobey you.

74
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,200
He is just acting stupid

75
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,950
as your son.

76
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,240
Zheng works in the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,460
Qi wanted to help him.

78
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,640
He was just being an older brother.

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,520
He has no bad intentions.

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,440
No matter what his intention is,

81
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,500
he made a mistake, he has to take the responsibility.

82
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,920
He acknowledged his fault.

83
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,840
If we don't punish him according to the law,

84
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,170
the officials

85
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,650
wouldn't let go of him.

86
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,010
Yin Qi has no talent to serve Xinchuan.

87
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,210
Please demote him to a civilian.

88
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,690
Let him go.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,620
He is your son.

90
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,460
Don't let him rot in prison.

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,290
Are you willing to

92
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,530
give up your son like this?

93
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,530
Yin Qi is incapable.

94
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,380
He's just kind.

95
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,510
He is not suitable for the court.

96
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,170
Now that he has made a big mistake,

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,690
let him leave.

98
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
I have no more wishes.

99
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,310
I just want him to be safe.

100
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,860
Lady Jing.

101
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,520
Lady Jing.

102
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,460
How is it?

103
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,890
You can go in and see Prince Qi.

104
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,760
But

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,530
I'm afraid he can't keep his title.

106
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,190
Madam Chun wants you to go in and persuade him.

107
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,620
Shangguan.

108
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,610
Why are you here?

109
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,710
Madam Chun went to beg Lord Xinchuan

110
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,930
to let me see you.

111
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,960
But he didn't give me much time.

112
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,290
Okay.

113
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,560
Father.

114
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,790
Father took Zheng away.

115
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm afraid he's giving up on me.

116
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,170
Lord Xinchuan knows you well.

117
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,650
But the officials are talking about you.

118
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,250
There must be an answer.

119
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,560
But he has promised Madam Chun.

120
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,220
He won't punish you severely.

121
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,810
As long as you stay away from the court

122
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,290
and be a civilian.

123
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,580
That's good too.

124
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,350
Father has always despised me,

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,250
a useless son.

126
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,120
My ability is limited.

127
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,350
I won't be able to achieve anything big.

128
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,630
That's better.

129
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,800
Everyone advised me to let you stop worrying.

130
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
I said he's open-minded.

131
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,890
He wouldn't grumble for such a trivial matter.

132
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,950
But look at you now.

133
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,910
You look like you want to hang yourself.

134
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,240
What do you want me to do?

135
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,930
No.

136
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,520
I won't embarrass you.

137
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,480
I'm the most generous.

138
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,580
Don't you know me?

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,940
I'm just like you.

140
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,480
It hurts where you got hit, right?

141
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,800
No.

142
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,520
It doesn't hurt at all.

143
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,120
I can perform with the spear for you when I go home now.

144
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,800
Stop joking with me.

145
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,170
I'm really fine.

146
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,800
It's just a few meals in prison.

147
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,190
Let me tell you.

148
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,110
For thousands of years,

149
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,040
how many Princes have been in prison in Xinchuan?

150
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,360
Think about how special I am.

151
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,760
Right?

152
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,300
Stop frowning.

153
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,090
So ugly.

154
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,850
You're ugly.

155
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,640
By the way,

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,800
this is for you.

157
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,730
I almost forgot.

158
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,840
It's sweet.

159
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,780
Thank you.

160
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,180
Is it sweet?

161
00:09:59,640 --> 00:09:59,970
Here.

162
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,280
I don't want it.

163
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,520
I brought them for you.

164
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,290
Try one.

165
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,010
Sweet.

166
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,680
Jing.

167
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,540
I should go now.

168
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,790
Take care.

169
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,760
I'll wait for you at home.

170
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,490
Don't worry.

171
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,210
Go.

172
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,070
Leave.

173
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,430
[Garden of Tranquility]

174
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,270
Prince Zheng is back.

175
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,950
Yin Zheng.

176
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
How's your wound?

177
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,340
Madam Chun sent a message saying

178
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,400
that Prince Qi will be released soon.

179
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,240
Don't worry.

180
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,150
The decree of dethronement

181
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,360
will be issued soon.

182
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,340
That's enough.

183
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,090
Just stand and answer.

184
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,290
Judging from your expression,

185
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,260
you do not concede.

186
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,920
I didn't do anything wrong.

187
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,030
Why should I concede?

188
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,420
You've been educated.

189
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,840
You also learned principles.

190
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,250
As an official,

191
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
you're not wrong?

192
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,490
Father has given up on me.

193
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,360
Now,

194
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,220
I am no longer an official.

195
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,430
You don't have to explain yourself to your officials.

196
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,670
Is it the same between father and son?

197
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,260
You know

198
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,570
what is right or wrong.

199
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,980
You just want to choose a son to be abandoned.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,790
That's all.

201
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,780
Ridiculous!

202
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,600
Father.

203
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,070
Since I was little,

204
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,110
everyone thinks I'm stupid.

205
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,630
Actually, I can see it clearly.

206
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,490
A few words from others

207
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,980
instigated father

208
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,550
to suspect Zheng.

209
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,960
But he's useful.

210
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,280
You have to choose

211
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,320
a useless son

212
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,560
to be abandoned.

213
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,640
How could there be such a father in the world?

214
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,500
Outsiders can only talk about pros and cons,

215
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,930
but family...

216
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,720
How can there be no right or wrong in a family?

217
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,680
Unfilial son.

218
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,250
From now on,

219
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,790
you are not my son.

220
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,250
Father, thank you for the crime.

221
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,020
Father, thank you for sparing my life.

222
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,470
Father, thank you for raising me.

223
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:44,980
Qi.

224
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,420
Why are you doing this?

225
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,710
The injury and the matter.

226
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,110
Why did you admit what you didn't do?

227
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,140
I know.

228
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,190
But Mother,

229
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,160
you told me before.

230
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,630
I'm the older brother.

231
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,800
I can't let them bully Zheng.

232
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,960
You have been protecting me since I was young.

233
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,460
He has no one by his side.

234
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,250
At times like this,

235
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
I have to protect him.

236
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,210
It's my fault.

237
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,150
I can't protect you.

238
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,030
Don't blame me.

239
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,180
Of course not.

240
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,170
Mother.

241
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,860
Why are you crying?

242
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,680
Of course I know you're doing this for my own good.

243
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,230
Besides,

244
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,320
now that I'm no longer a Prince,

245
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,660
I'll be more carefree.

246
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
In this big world,

247
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,620
I'll travel around.

248
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,860
By the way, Mother.

249
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,550
In the past,

250
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,850
Shangguan said there are many places she hasn't been to.

251
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,760
Now I can go with her.

252
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,900
Mother.

253
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,930
Just say what you want to say.

254
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,980
I've been in prison.

255
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,130
Is there anything I can't take?

256
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,920
Qi.

257
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,900
Now that the Lord abolished your title as a Prince,

258
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,359
all the glory must be taken back.

259
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,089
Shangguan is a princess.

260
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,530
According to the rules of marriage in the nine regions,

261
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,680
she has the right to divorce you.

262
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,060
Princess.

263
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,410
Now that Prince Qi is dethroned,

264
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,360
according to the rules of the alliance of the nine regions,

265
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,090
you have the right to break off your marriage.

266
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,490
You can return to Danchuan freely.

267
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,760
Please tell Madam Chun,

268
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,380
I, Shangguan Jing,

269
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,670
won't abandon Qi

270
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,420
whether he's a Prince or a beggar.

271
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,420
In the future,

272
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,000
your life will be hard.

273
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm not afraid.

274
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Prince Qi is an open-minded man too.

275
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,970
He doesn't care about these nonsense.

276
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,110
It's said that you two don't get along

277
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,370
and have been separated for years.

278
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,060
Now it seems

279
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,020
you have feelings for each other.

280
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,170
I'm happy to see this.

281
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,010
You don't have to be alone.

282
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,750
But she's someone's daughter.

283
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,090
Even if she refuses to divorce you,

284
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,700
the future will not be as good as before.

285
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,090
How are you going to live?

286
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,330
Don't you need to discuss it?

287
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,440
I know.

288
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,520
She said she's loyal to me.

289
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,160
She won't leave me behind!

290
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,270
Silly girl.

291
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,260
It's okay, Mother.

292
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,030
It's okay.

293
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,170
I'll announce it tomorrow.

294
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,120
Prince Qi is expelled

295
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
from the court.

296
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,650
Do as Song said,

297
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,130
close the restaurant

298
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,060
owned by those women.

299
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:13,970
Yes.

300
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,270
How could there be such a father in the world?

301
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,140
Outsiders can only talk about pros and cons,

302
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,490
but family...

303
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,040
How can there be no right or wrong in a family?

304
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,320
It's bustling outside.

305
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,180
But our shop is closed.

306
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,850
They didn't give us a reason.

307
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,040
This is bullying.

308
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,430
Don't worry.

309
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,190
There will be a solution.

310
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,330
Have some tea.

311
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,110
You're back.

312
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,970
What happened?

313
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,080
The Legitimate Eldest Prince proposed

314
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
to ask the Lord

315
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,460
to suspend Prince Zheng.

316
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,790
Our restaurant and shop

317
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,420
will be closed too.

318
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,020
Why does the Legitimate Eldest Prince always pick on us?

319
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,500
He's afraid that Yin Zheng would use this restaurant

320
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,760
to win over outsiders.

321
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,780
That's why...

322
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,960
Why is he still alive?

323
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't be angry.

324
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,540
We'll figure out a way

325
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,200
to solve Yin Zheng's problem.

326
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,210
We don't need to give up the restaurant or shop either.

327
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,270
Before reopening,

328
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,020
we can use the profit we accumulated

329
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,290
to pay the rent.

330
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,080
Then let's clear the inventory

331
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,850
and sell them at a low price for emergency money.

332
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,740
I just sorted out the accounts.

333
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,490
As long as we can survive this period,

334
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,260
the restaurant will be reopened.

335
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,110
Don't worry.

336
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,790
I'll go count

337
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,220
how much cash is left.

338
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,530
Hao Jia.

339
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,440
You haven't fully recovered.

340
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,570
Don't work too hard.

341
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,790
Don't be angry either.

342
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,390
Go back to your room and rest.

343
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,930
I feel much better.

344
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,670
Thank you for taking care of me lately.

345
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,920
Now that there is trouble,

346
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,720
I want to help.

347
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,340
So please tell me if there's anything wrong.

348
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,100
I want to catch Yin Song

349
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,150
and blow his head off.

350
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,540
Calm down.

351
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,110
Things are not easy in your mansion.

352
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,140
If you make a scene again,

353
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,470
I'm afraid you'll drag Danchuan down too.

354
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,840
It's never too late for a gentleman to take revenge.

355
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,280
Once everything is settled,

356
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,540
you can still beat him.

357
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,150
I've planned on

358
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,940
how,

359
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,180
how many times

360
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,960
and how heavy to beat him.

361
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,670
You really thought it through.

362
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,400
Impressive.

363
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,390
Calm down.

364
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,630
Have some tea.

365
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,150
Shangguan,

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,630
I heard your restaurant has been closed.

367
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:16,990
Yes.

368
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,070
This wouldn't have happened

369
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,420
in Danchuan.

370
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,020
We're just doing our own business.

371
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,390
It's fine that you guys are plotting things against each other,

372
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,120
but why did you get us involved?

373
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,260
Indeed,

374
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,500
I dragged you down.

375
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,660
No, I didn't mean that.

376
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,560
Bad news!

377
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,890
Something happened.

378
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,820
Prince and Lady.

379
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,800
What's wrong?

380
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,960
A decree from the palace said

381
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,060
that Qi will be demoted.

382
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,960
By common practice,

383
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,240
you have to move out of the Garden of Modesty.

384
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,470
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has sent someone to check.

385
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,930
Prince Yue came in person.

386
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,860
Get these things out of here.

387
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,990
Brother Song said

388
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,570
this yard will be given to me

389
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,870
to open the mansion.

390
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
Put everything down.

391
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,030
Princess Shangguan

392
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,170
is as domineering as ever.

393
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,450
But now Qi

394
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,430
is no longer a Prince.

395
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,160
There is order from the palace to clear this place out.

396
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,470
This is the rule.

397
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:15,820
So?

398
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,860
Prince Qi disobeyed the Lord.

399
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,240
You want to try it too?

400
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,230
Whether I'm a Prince or not,

401
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,780
you have to call me Brother Qi.

402
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,950
Clearing the Garden is the business of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

403
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,280
What are you doing here?

404
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,180
Clearing the Garden is the business of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

405
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,240
What does it have to do with you?

406
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,960
Oh my god.

407
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,490
Look at you.

408
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,920
Why are you still posing?

409
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,160
I'm here following the order

410
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,410
of Brother Song, the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

411
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,800
I'm here to watch people of no importance

412
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,030
who's been dethroned,

413
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,830
in case he refuses to leave.

414
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,360
Say that again?

415
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,630
What?

416
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,360
You want to fight?

417
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,590
Let me tell you.

418
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,760
I haven't got even with you for

419
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,790
what happened at the restaurant last time.

420
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,150
I won't haggle over it with you.

421
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,610
Things are different now.

422
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,450
Qi is nothing now.

423
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,630
You want to fight me?

424
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,320
Do you have the eligibility?

425
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,450
Yue.

426
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,730
What goes around comes around.

427
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,190
You're so complacent now.

428
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,170
Have you ever thought about the future?

429
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,430
I've thought about it.

430
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,330
My glory is on the way.

431
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,400
When Brother Song...

432
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,730
You and Zheng

433
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,570
will be completely over.

434
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,050
Do you know

435
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
why Father abolished you so easily?

436
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,400
It's because you're useless.

437
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,510
A Prince who was expelled

438
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,010
will leave a bad name in history.

439
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,610
Protect His Majesty!

440
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,840
Protect His Majesty!

441
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,250
Stop!

442
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,430
Don't go!

443
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,810
You guys!

444
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,150
You bastards!

445
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,600
Fine.

446
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,050
I'll forgive you.

447
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,440
My mother is Madam Xinchuan.

448
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,830
My brother is the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

449
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,260
You're protecting your husband as an untamed Danchuan shrew.

450
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,760
Let me tell you.

451
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,250
Qi doesn't like you at all.

452
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,330
He likes girls like Hao Jia.

453
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,530
Look at yourself.

454
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,320
You overestimated yourself.

455
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,480
I really don't know what to say.

456
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,080
You always carry a big spear.

457
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,580
OK. You two.

458
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,970
Let me tell you.

459
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,040
I just caught a cold.

460
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,880
When I recover,

461
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,930
I'll report to my mother now.

462
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,560
You two will be over.

463
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,090
Get lost!

464
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,640
Shangguan.

465
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,620
Don't bother yourself with them.

466
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,210
Just leave it like that.

467
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,240
Mr. Zhou.

468
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,690
Stop cleaning.

469
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,220
We don't know when the restaurant will open.

470
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,110
I just want to clean it every day.

471
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,140
When it is time to open,

472
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,190
it won't be a mess.

473
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,230
This time is different from what happened with Duke Yue.

474
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,920
The future of this restaurant is unpredictable.

475
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,470
Mr. Zhou,

476
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,690
it's okay if you want to find another way out.

477
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,130
We understand.

478
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,550
Boss,

479
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,630
since you took over this restaurant,

480
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,520
you've been nice to me.

481
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,030
You treated me like family.

482
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,100
Even in a situation like this,

483
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,950
you didn't pay less salary to

484
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,940
a normal employee like me.

485
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,680
How could I do such an ungrateful thing?

486
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,530
I can't just think about myself now.

487
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,240
I don't know how long we'll have to endure this.

488
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,050
The revenue we had from back then can last a while.

489
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,480
I'm afraid...

490
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,440
Haitang.

491
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,100
Shangguan.

492
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,350
Take this.

493
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,420
Where did you get so much cash?

494
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,000
It's nothing.

495
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,400
I just pawned some weapons that I didn't use.

496
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,640
I don't need that many anyway.

497
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,900
Aren't those your most precious things?

498
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Take it.

499
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,910
Take it as my added investment.

500
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,400
When we open again,

501
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,270
I'll be the biggest shareholder here.

502
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,790
Now that the restaurant is closed,

503
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,000
our women's shop will be closed too.

504
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,850
Now our daily rent

505
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,210
and the salary of our employees

506
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,660
at least cost 132 taels a day.

507
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,920
There's also the solar term girls' daily expenses we have to account for.

508
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,980
I've done the math.

509
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,420
Our savings

510
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,370
can last for two months at most.

511
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,830
From tomorrow onwards,

512
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,530
let's clear the inventory

513
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,650
and sell them at a lower price.

514
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,080
We can get more money.

515
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,070
We need to be prepared to not be opened anytime soon.

516
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,930
Yuping and Yuzhan will come to help tomorrow too.

517
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,840
I'll come too.

518
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,170
I'm afraid it's inappropriate for you to show up.

519
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,020
It's all because of me.

520
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,420
I can't sit by and watch.

521
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,050
As long as there's something I can do,

522
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,110
I want to do my best.

523
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,300
Don't feel guilty.

524
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,930
It's not all your fault.

525
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,630
We shared happiness.

526
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,330
We'll also share weal and woe.

527
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,190
As long as we are together,

528
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,720
all problems can be solved.

529
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,660
[Reflect Upon Oneself]

530
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,690
I feel like Lady Wei is always like the sun.

531
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,240
No matter what the problem is,

532
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,200
as long as she is here,

533
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,990
it can be solved.

534
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,490
Yes.

535
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,590
As long as Lady Wei is here,

536
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,050
nothing will be a problem.

537
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,680
Lady Wei,

538
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,420
when are we going to the restaurant tomorrow?

539
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,640
What's wrong, Lady Wei?

540
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,370
I don't know.

541
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,770
I keep feeling worried.

542
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,270
But you were fine just now.

543
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,130
You even encouraged everyone.

544
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,040
If everyone is so depressed,

545
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,410
and no one cheers others up,

546
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,940
then the situation will get worse.

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,480
You said you weren't afraid,

548
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,130
it turns out that you actually kept it to yourself.

549
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,470
I hope we can get through it this time.

550
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:58,800
Lady Wei.

551
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,980
Butler Su.

552
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,480
Lady Wei.

553
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,170
Prince Zheng specially asked me

554
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,950
to bring you the soothing incense.

555
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,950
It helps with sleep.

556
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,610
He wants you to have a good rest

557
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,920
and have a good sleep.

558
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,810
I'll put it here for you.

559
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,820
He also wants to tell you.

560
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,840
Don't keep things to yourself.

561
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,370
Don't always think about others.

562
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,970
You'll suffocate yourself.

563
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,640
Thank you.

564
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,170
We're family.

565
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,350
Don’t mention it.

566
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,160
Lady Wei.

567
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,110
Chef Liu.

568
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,460
Lady Wei.

569
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,410
It's time to eat green dumplings.

570
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,610
Lady Ying asked us to make these for you.

571
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,020
Also,

572
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,000
Her Ladyship has changed the rules for you.

573
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,620
We are allowed to have midnight snacks in the future.

574
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,320
Really?

575
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,610
-Awesome. -Really!

576
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,450
Lady Wei must like it the most.

577
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,100
Yes.

578
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,610
Lady Wei.

579
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,490
Have a try.

580
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,220
Yes, try it.

581
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,690
Be careful.

582
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,890
Don't burn yourself.

583
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,930
How is it?

584
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,100
Delicious.

585
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,720
Have a try.

586
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,040
I'll have one.

587
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,290
Thank you, Lady Wei.

588
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,120
Here.

589
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,700
Thank you, Lady Wei.

590
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,180
It's delicious, Chef Liu.

591
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,860
Sweet.

592
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,080
Prince and Princess know Lady Wei well.

593
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,680
Of course.

594
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,100
Lady Wei.

595
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,130
Don't worry.

596
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,390
As long as we are together,

597
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,320
we can overcome all difficulties.

598
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,730
We can overcome all difficulties.

599
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,910
We can have midnight snacks in the future.

600
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,160
The Legitimate Eldest Prince wanted to depose me.

601
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,890
He didn't succeed, but in the end he still hurt me.

602
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,970
It's such a pity that Brother Qi was involved.

603
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,540
It's my fault.

604
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,350
Don't be disappointed when you are in a desperate situation,

605
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,900
because it might be the beginning of hope.

606
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,489
Since the Lord has decided

607
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,530
to let Prince Qi take the punishment,

608
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,280
that means he wanted to protect you.

609
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,449
You're the one who can't be missed.

610
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,679
He took the blame in order to protect you.

611
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,000
You can't let him down.

612
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,659
You know the situation better than me.

613
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,179
It's useless to blame yourself.

614
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,430
Since Prince Song wants to be my enemy,

615
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,880
I'll make him pay for it.

616
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,760
Your writing brush goes like dragons and snakes.

617
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,950
Your strength penetrates the paper.

618
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,360
Your handwriting is getting better.

619
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,060
Thank you, Father.

620
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,140
His Majesty has always been strict with Song.

621
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,370
In order to get your praise,

622
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,110
he never slacked off when practising calligraphy.

623
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,570
Since he entered the court, he has been diligent day and night.

624
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,560
He wanted to share your burden.

625
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,540
You always praise him in front of me.

626
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,850
In your eyes,

627
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,420
your son has no flaws.

628
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,380
I dare not.

629
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,100
Neither do I.

630
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,570
How dare he make mistakes

631
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,400
in front of you?

632
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,100
He remembers everything

633
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,150
you taught him.

634
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,990
Yes.

635
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,040
The case of the Ministry of Revenue is indeed done well recently.

636
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,560
The counterfeit notes are almost all confiscated.

637
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,720
The middle minister said that

638
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,150
he did other things meticulously as well.

639
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,940
He does act like a Legitimate Eldest Prince.

640
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,570
I have something important to do. I'll go back first.

641
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,750
Goodbye, Father.

642
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,700
He won't ask your brothers

643
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,390
to take over the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

644
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,480
Just leave it to the staff.

645
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,910
Father is a wise Lord.

646
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,440
Those illegitimate sons have improper thought.

647
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,990
Father told me

648
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,520
he put them beside me

649
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,100
to encourage me.

650
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,340
Is you information reliable?

651
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,700
Did Chen Xi really sneak back to Xinchuan?

652
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,800
He must have some unfinished business with the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

653
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,530
The Legitimate Eldest Prince.

654
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,700
The Legitimate Eldest Prince.

655
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,280
Are you scared, Brother An?

656
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,210
No.

657
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,080
You're still suspended.

658
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,200
You're investigating the case without permission.

659
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,330
This is against the rules.

660
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,260
Chen Xi got Brother Song involved.

661
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,360
This is an important matter.

662
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,850
No one wants you to investigate it.

663
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:26,920
So I called you here,

664
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,040
because I hope you can clear your name.

665
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,820
But if I didn't say that,

666
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,820
you would have done the same, right?

667
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,020
Stop messing around.

668
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,250
I'm serious.

669
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,940
We both know

670
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,070
Song doesn't dare to lead the thing with the counterfeit notes.

671
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,110
He just wanted to gain profit from it.

672
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,080
But later he found out

673
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,050
what Chen Xi did.

674
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,960
It's too late.

675
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,590
He's already on the bad side.

676
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,240
Can't you just end the case

677
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,410
on Chen Xi?

678
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,690
I don't want to see

679
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,550
you end up like Qi.

680
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,080
Thank you for your concern.

681
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,980
But the Legitimate Eldest Prince

682
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,790
should be responsible for what he's done.

683
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,720
When do you want to catch Chen Xi?

684
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:15,870
Tonight.

685
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,020
Coming.

686
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,170
Looking for me?

687
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,020
I made blind dishes

688
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,360
to prepare for the restoration of the restaurant.

689
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,620
I want you to have a try.

690
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,780
Blind dishes?

691
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,890
They are cooked in a sealed bronze jar.

692
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,680
The ingredients such as

693
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,780
duck stomach, wax gourd, etc. are wrapped up.

694
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,230
Before the customers open it,

695
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,960
they don't know what's inside.

696
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,420
If you like it,

697
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,460
others will definitely like it.

698
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,520
Yanchuan wax gourd and Jinchuan seafood.

699
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,620
They're refreshing and delicious together.

700
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,470
I'm a genius.

701
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,110
But I don't like seafood.

702
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,260
Why don't you ask the Princess

703
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,100
to help you?

704
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,790
She said we have to be frugal

705
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,440
and refused resolutely.

706
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,600
That's why you came to me.

707
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,360
But I have something important to do.

708
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,990
I can't.

709
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,320
Yin Zheng.

710
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,050
Okay.

711
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,720
Is it good?

712
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,280
Using wax gourd to elevate the sweetness of the dish.

713
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,350
It's a good idea.

714
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,140
Not bad.

715
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,610
Are you not that nervous now?

716
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,990
You have something important to do tonight.

717
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,430
I didn't want you to be nervous.

718
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,490
So I designed this interlude for you.

719
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,060
I told Su Shen

720
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,640
if anything happens to me...

721
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,840
Nothing will happen.

722
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,320
I investigated the case privately. Even if I catch him,

723
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,160
I may be punished

724
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,580
and be demoted to a civilian.

725
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,640
Aren't you afraid?

726
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,780
That's good.

727
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,870
Then you will be the same as me.

728
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,480
My immortal Prince Zheng

729
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,140
will finally become a mortal.

730
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,530
You don't eat much.

731
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
I can support you.

732
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,960
Why are you laughing?

733
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,420
I have some land at home.

734
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,640
I have chickens, ducks, cows, sheep and donkeys.

735
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,770
There is an osmanthus tree in the yard.

736
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,320
We can make wine in autumn.

737
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,420
But you can't eat for free.

738
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,900
You have to work.

739
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,230
Okay.

740
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,000
It's up to you.

741
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,580
It's getting late.

742
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,680
I'm leaving.

743
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,490
I can't finish

744
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,580
all the wax gourd in it.

745
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
You have to come back.

746
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,860
I'll wait for you at home.

747
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,450
Okay.

748
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,360
♫The south wind meets the clouds♫

749
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,030
♫The moonlight calls the candle♫

750
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:58,810

752
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:12,320
♫I'm worried that you'll see through my mind by my eyes♫

753

755
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,950
♫I don't speak in an excessive way. Nor do I express my feelings♫

756
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,750
♫Who should I tell about the one I love?♫

757
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,850
♫By now, my words have turned into wind, and my missing of you has melted into fog♫

758
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,610
♫I wrote about the past into a letter♫

759
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:46,270
♫If you and I know each other well, there's no need to write more♫

760
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,170
♫My mind runs wild, and I don't know where is the way to go back♫

761
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,660
♫I love you deeply and there's nothing else I ask for♫

762
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:00,720
♫I only wish the two of us could love each other as one soul, eat three meals together and spend the four seasons together♫

763
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,980
♫The south wind meets the clouds♫

764
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,780
♫The moonlight calls the candle♫

765
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,340
♫As far as the eye can see, it's just a regular sight♫

766
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,220
♫Why am I being absent-minded?♫

767
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,590
♫And why am I hesitating?♫

768
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,200
♫I'm worried that you'll see through my mind by my eyes♫

769
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,820
♫My words are not surprising. Nor is my language inaccurate♫

770
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,740
♫I've got some affection towards you♫

771
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:58,760
♫I don't speak in an excessive way. Nor do I express my feelings♫

772
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,020
♫Who should I tell about the one I love?♫
