00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,729
Song.

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,259
Mother.

6
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,220
Get up.

7
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,130
How have you been

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,240
for the past few days?

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,330
I'm sorry for your concern.

10
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,180
I've been doing fine.

11
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,320
After today,

12
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,980
I'm going to live in exile.

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,920
Please take care of your health.

14
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,760
Mother.

15
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,520
Don't offend Father again

16
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,360
and involve yourself.

17
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,750
I will manage to send you some money.

18
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,650
When your father's anger subsides

19
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,280
Soon, when your father's anger is gone,

20
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,410
I'll try to take you back to the capital

21
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,910
with your uncle.

22
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,930
That's not necessary.

23
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,390
I don't think Father would want to see me again.

24
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,990
If you miss me,

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,840
you can write to or visit me.

26
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,230
It's all the same.

27
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,940
I’m just

28
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,320
a commoner now.

29
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,950
I want to try

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,720
to live by my own hands.

31
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,690
That's good.

32
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,670
Anyway, I don't have to be

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,870
a prisoner anymore.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,640
Farewell.

35
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,090
Mother.

36
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,360
Brother.

37
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,200
Zai.

38
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,160
It's my fault to have spoiled you.

39
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,730
Learn a lesson

40
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,610
from me.

41
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,310
This forbidden palace

42
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,890
is full of sorrow.

43
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,550
You must behave yourself.

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,340
Remember to take care of yourself

45
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,659
and Mother.

46
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:43,780
I see.

47
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,550
Madam.

48
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,370
Song.

49
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,710
I am forever grateful

50
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,470
for your upbringing.

51
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,930
The Lord has asked me to give this to you.

52
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,350
Take care of yourself in the future.

53
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,420
Whether it's a gift from the Lord or compensation,

54
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,060
I won't need it.

55
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,820
I'm going there to meditate on my past.

56
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,130
Why would I need money?

57
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,060
Mother.

58
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,970
Mother.

59
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,570
-Mother. -Madam.

60
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,590
My Lord.

61
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,580
Prince Song has left.

62
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,600
But the baggage…

63
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,390
He’s acting like

64
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,260
the Legitimate Eldest Prince now.

65
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,690
[Remember when I returned home the last December, the snow was flying.]

66
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,690
[Not a single letter during the three years received, I can't bear to picture the scenario.]

67
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,680
He's not a good son,

68
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,030
nor a good brother.

69
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,850
It's all my fault

70
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,880
after all.

71
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,500
I failed

72
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,240
to supervise and admonish him.

73
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,830
My Lord, you had high hopes for Prince Song.

74
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,580
He has disappointed you.

75
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,290
High hopes?

76
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,510
I just lost a son.

77
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,590
And the Ministry of Rites and Middle Minister can't wait to ask

78
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,330
who my great hope is.

79
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,200
They all said I should make a decision.

80
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,660
But how many more of my sons

81
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,670
is this decision going to take?

82
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,010
How has Prince An been doing

83
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,850
with the Ministry of Revenue these days?

84
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:08,920
My Lord.

85
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,790
Prince An has been discussing everything with Prince Zheng.

86
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,240
They've done well.

87
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:19,930
Liang Shi.

88
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,650
Yes.

89
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,280
What do you think of Prince Zheng

90
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,670
as a minister

91
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,120
and as a son?

92
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,720
I dare not speak out of turn.

93
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Say it.

94
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,010
Yes.

95
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,490
Prince Zheng is respectful to My Lord.

96
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,570
He's sophisticated.

97
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,670
and generous.

98
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,900
In the case of Chen Xi,

99
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,670
he didn't kill all of them,

100
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
so he's gained a reputation of benevolence

101
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,550
overnight.

102
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,640
The court had impeached him for abusive interrogation.

103
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,540
But now the Ministry of Rites

104
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,300
is praising him for his benevolence.

105
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,520
Once in the Prince's palace,

106
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,900
it was as if he didn't exist.

107
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,180
But he has made him seen

108
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,280
overnight.

109
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,500
Now many people are saying

110
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,530
he's a worthy successor.

111
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,630
Get up.

112
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,430
Thank you, My Lord.

113
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,970
You don't have to tremble

114
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,170
in front of me.

115
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
I understand.

116
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,810
He's a good son.

117
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,220
It's just

118
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,490
we can scarcely spend father-son time

119
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,870
in this palace.

120
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,050
Your Highness, are you working on something?

121
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,800
Come in.

122
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,730
This is a déjà vu.

123
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,180
Today I went to the restaurant.

124
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,850
Li Wei took care of everything very well.

125
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,740
She can do it on her own now.

126
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,540
Thank you for your concern, Princess.

127
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,370
Prince Song has left.

128
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,280
Prince An has taken charge of the Ministry of Revenue.

129
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,810
Now that you have a bright future ahead of you,

130
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,920
I think

131
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,880
my mission is accomplished.

132
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,740
Are you thinking of leaving?

133
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,170
I think it's time.

134
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,620
Okay.

135
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,400
That's decisive.

136
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,820
Why else?

137
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,450
I can't keep you here in this mansion.

138
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,030
I know you well.

139
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,900
Otherwise, I would take Li Wei away with me.

140
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,920
But I'm worried

141
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,990
now may not be the best time.

142
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,160
I'm afraid it may cause trouble for you.

143
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,110
Don't worry.

144
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Since I've made the promise,

145
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,830
I will keep my word.

146
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,970
Thank you, Your Highness.

147
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,550
May all go well.

148
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,900
[Make each day count]

149
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,570
It's already been watered.

150
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,970
Who is being so diligent?

151
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,380
The vegetable patch has been watered too.

152
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,540
Baifu, time to eat.

153
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,950
You've had your breakfast so early.

154
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,010
Who made it for you?

155
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,170
Then have some more.

156
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,940
Your Ladyship.

157
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,050
What a feast.

158
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,560
Her Ladyship has specially ordered all this.

159
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,160
They're all your favorites.

160
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,370
Where's Yuan Ying?

161
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,280
She's gone to the restaurant.

162
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,940
It's not time to open.

163
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,280
That's right.

164
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,520
Her Ladyship has been acting strange today.

165
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,120
Although she's used to working hard,

166
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,250
she didn't sleep all night last night.

167
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,590
And she was up early this morning to visit the garden

168
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,570
and she cleaned up the whole mansion.

169
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,460
She also gave us a lot of instructions,

170
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,390
telling us to take good care of you.

171
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,260
Your Ladyship.

172
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,520
What's wrong?

173
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,960
Why are you still standing there?

174
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,160
Come and help me pack.

175
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,170
Are you leaving?

176
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
You've got everything in the mansion

177
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,040
under control.

178
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,740
Yuping and Yuzhan are all good servants.

179
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,510
They don't need further instructions

180
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,810
to listen to you.

181
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,670
I was going to go to the kitchen

182
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,490
to tell Liu Baoquan something.

183
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,820
But then I thought,

184
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,030
you're the best at eating.

185
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,160
I don't need to worry about it.

186
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,859
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

187
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,579
Prince Song is in exile.

188
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,119
There is no way he can start again.

189
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:16,480
The Ministry of Revenue and the Nine Regions Affairs Division are going on well.

190
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,119
Now

191
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,190
a new prospect is opened up.

192
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,170
So…

193
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,710
His Highness has gone to Lord Xinchuan.

194
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680
I guess he'll be

195
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,580
talking about the divorce.

196
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,910
You don't need to worry about me.

197
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,840
You can take care of everything

198
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,850
without me.

199
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,010
I think it's time for me

200
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,010
to go live my own life.

201
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,370
But I can't let you go.

202
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,400
I really want to

203
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,210
keep you with me forever.

204
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,840
But I know I can't.

205
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,780
You are the brightest person in the world.

206
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,790
You're meant for a higher place

207
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
and a better life.

208
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,710
You must live the life you want.

209
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,740
So do you.

210
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,410
We can both

211
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,890
live the life we want.

212
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
What about my unfilial sons?

213
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,590
You should know

214
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,040
what they're doing, right?

215
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,420
Qi recently went to Danchuan

216
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,480
to look for Princess Shangguan.

217
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,110
He'll probably suffer a lot.

218
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,340
I thought he didn't like the Princess from Danchuan.

219
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,760
It seems he does.

220
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,310
For how many days has he been gone?

221
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,770
He's been gone for a while.

222
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,960
When he writes back,

223
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,390
I'll bring the letter

224
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,020
so you can see if his handwriting is improved.

225
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,930
I don't think his terrible handwriting.

226
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,110
can get any better.

227
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,620
Father, I have something

228
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,270
to discuss with you.

229
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,280
Go ahead.

230
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,910
I want to divorce Princess Yuan Ying.

231
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,360
Why are you all

232
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
so absurd?

233
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,660
It was rare for couples to leave each other in Xinchuan.

234
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,690
But now even the Prince's family is falling apart.

235
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,580
What kind of bad tendency is this?

236
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,470
I know it's not the norm.

237
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:03,930
But

238
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,560
the Princess and I have come up with a foolproof plan.

239
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,170
It won't affect the relations between the two regions.

240
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,800
It's all

241
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,110
because of Li Wei from Jichuan.

242
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,340
I told you long ago,

243
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,710
a great man should not indulge in love.

244
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,160
Yes.

245
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,860
But a family is a family.

246
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,900
If I can keep it harmonious,

247
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,140
I'll get to be more dedicated to foreign affairs, right?

248
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,710
In fact, compared to internal affairs,

249
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,170
the Princess is more suitable for the court.

250
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,540
She must be a great success in the future.

251
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,870
I'd like to exchange my previous reward

252
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,040
with her freedom.

253
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,710
And I'm open to any punishment.

254
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,510
[Edict of Lord Xinchuan]

255
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,860
Father has agreed to our divorce.

256
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,470
You can go home now.

257
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,910
Next, we'll have to think of a way

258
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,450
to persuade Lord Jinchuan.

259
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,470
We may face some trouble

260
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,500
when we get back.

261
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,400
I have six brothers,

262
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,160
five of which are born by concubines.

263
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,020
But all of them are very stubborn.

264
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,750
Yuan Xu is the eldest,

265
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,360
and the worst one.

266
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,980
But my parents love him.

267
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,630
They always put him first.

268
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,200
They wouldn't even let me reprimand him to his face.

269
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,250
If he says something inappropriate,

270
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,970
I'd like to say sorry in advance.

271
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,050
It's okay.

272
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,080
I also have a worrying brother.

273
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,880
I understand.

274
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,380
You have not only a worrying younger brother,

275
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,310
but also a worrying elder brother.

276
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,520
My mother has my best interests at heart,

277
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,690
but she is weak.

278
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,690
She doesn't have a say in front of my father.

279
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,850
If Madam Jinchuan cares about your happiness,

280
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,120
we can persuade her anyway.

281
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,350
I hope so.

282
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,080
But my father

283
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,180
is the toughest one to deal with.

284
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,700
He's used to being strong.

285
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,320
He's also very old-fashioned about his children's marriage.

286
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,780
It's hard to convince him.

287
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,730
You know what?

288
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,820
I should have entered the palace with you.

289
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,490
But my father saw my marriage as a business.

290
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,210
He had planned for me to marry into Xinchuan

291
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,440
but couldn't decide which Prince

292
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,500
would be the most profitable choice.

293
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,440
So he made me claim to be sick and withdrew from the election,

294
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,850
until he met Yin Zheng.

295
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,020
He was profit-oriented.

296
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,140
He can't agree

297
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,650
if it affects the relationship between the two regions.

298
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,770
What if

299
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,410
Xinchuan lowers taxes?

300
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,160
The tax levied by Xinchuan on the trade between the two regions

301
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,550
has always been high.

302
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,270
I believe this is also a major concern for Lord Jinchuan.

303
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,020
It is feasible.

304
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,100
Jinchuan has to sell

305
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,360
lacquer, fermentation, fish fry, etc. to Xinchuan.

306
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,900
Taxes are as high as 20 to 1.

307
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,240
Additional taxes are levied on dairy, cattle and sheep skins.

308
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,210
Merchant ships are also charged.

309
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,480
If we can establish a new standard

310
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,490
and reduce the overlapping taxes,

311
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,090
I believe Father will agree.

312
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,890
But…

313
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,190
Xinchuan used to impose heavy taxes

314
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,080
because Jinchuan had such a strong trade.

315
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,040
But now that the situation has changed,

316
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,640
Xinchuan also intends to re-establish the tax.

317
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,840
This can be of great benefit to the people of both regions.

318
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,460
I think I can convince Lord Jinchuan.

319
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

320
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,710
Your divorce

321
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,570
involves the issue of taxation.

322
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,560
And you have to bring out the people of the two regions.

323
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,860
That's the way big regions behave.

324
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,990
[Jinchuan Palace]

325
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,760
Your Highness.

326
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,730
The houses in Huangting Minxiang are ancient buildings.

327
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,390
You can't just tear them down.

328
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,740
If it's an emergency, it's fine.

329
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,680
If you're turning them into a place for entertainment,

330
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,800
the people's discontent will rise.

331
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Your Highness, please think again.

332
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,600
There's no making without breaking.

333
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,820
Let me tell you.

334
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,060
My sister and my brother-in-law

335
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,720
have opened a restaurant with nine-region cuisines in Xinchuan.

336
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,450
They've also introduced notes in place of coins.

337
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,780
Xinchuan is now much stronger.

338
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,930
We should also reform Jinchuan,

339
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,300
so that we don't fall too far behind.

340
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,900
Am I right?

341
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,400
Let's do that.

342
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,880
Reform is not nonsense.

343
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,660
Sister?

344
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,270
Doing it for the people

345
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,890
is innovation.

346
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,720
But you're destroying ancient buildings for the sake of pleasure.

347
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,650
That's ignorant

348
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,410
and shameless.

349
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,780
Why are you back?

350
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,540
This is the official document from three days ago.

351
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
You haven't made your approval yet.

352
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,590
How could Father allow you to discuss politics with the ministers?

353
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,190
You're a married woman.

354
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,780
Why do you have the right to be in charge of this?

355
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,430
I'm the eldest prince in charge of supervision.

356
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,230
How dare you talk to me like that?

357
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,740
Supervision?

358
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,150
I can't believe Father put you in the position of supervisor.

359
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,370
You don't want to handle politics.

360
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,510
You just want to do whatever you want with your power.

361
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,140
You don't really want to demolish

362
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,270
the buildings at Huangting Minxiang.

363
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,600
It was just a whim.

364
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,980
But no one was happy with it.

365
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,400
So you want to do it even more,

366
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,610
so that you can play the supervisor's role.

367
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:45,890
You…

368
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,560
What?

369
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,880
First, you neglect the official documents.

370
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,340
Second, you're a playboy without ambitions.

371
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,150
Third, your absurd decisions have caused public anger.

372
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,280
How dare you refute your elder sister?

373
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,450
Where is Father?

374
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,470
Come with me to see Father.

375
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,360
Why are you still standing here?

376
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,220
Get out of here!

377
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,090
Yuan Ying.

378
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,420
Although Yuan Xu has many problems,

379
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,240
he is the eldest prince.

380
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,980
You shouldn't judge him in front of foreign ministers.

381
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,230
That's right.

382
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,950
Brother-in-law, do something about her.

383
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,380
The princess was indeed a bit rash.

384
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,130
But as a supervisor,

385
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,880
I think you should do your duty.

386
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,660
You're so protective of her.

387
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,830
To see Zheng coming along

388
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,960
with Ying back to her family,

389
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,500
we're so relieved.

390
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,200
Mother, I had written to you

391
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,750
before I came back this time,

392
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,210
explaining that I'm not visiting families,

393
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,280
but…

394
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,950
I know.

395
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,560
You're afraid that I won't rest assured without seeing Zheng

396
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,490
after your marriage.

397
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,510
Among the several children,

398
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,560
your father is worried about you only.

399
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
He's afraid of you causing trouble.

400
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,000
Seeing your pleasing marriage

401
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,470
makes us both relieved now.

402
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,370
I didn't expect my mother to shut me up.

403
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,620
I really couldn't talk about divorce

404
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,980
in that situation.

405
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,460
I'm sorry.

406
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,820
I can't blame you for that.

407
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,950
The eldest prince is in charge of the government in Jinchuan?

408
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,500
Father intends to train Yuan Xu

409
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,530
and take a break.

410
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,630
It's a pity that he is a piece of scrap iron

411
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,050
that can't be made into gold.

412
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,520
Father probably knows what I want to do.

413
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,550
He's just pretending to be ignorant.

414
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,120
If you talk to Lord Jinchuan about this,

415
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,720
it'll be a family matter.

416
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,920
But if it's me who talks to Lord Jinchuan,

417
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,450
it'll be a business matter.

418
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,960
Why don't I talk with him?

419
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,170
This has been the case since I was a child.

420
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,050
Whatever I wanted to do, I couldn't do it.

421
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,220
I thought I could be seen

422
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,780
if I did my best in everything.

423
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,380
It turns out

424
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,490
even if they know I'm better than my brothers,

425
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,120
they still think

426
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,030
I'm just a daughter.

427
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,340
Sorry to drag you down with me.

428
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,860
Don't say that.

429
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
As long as you know

430
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,670
what you want to do,

431
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,720
all the indifference will turn into praise

432
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,460
after it's done.

433
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,010
[Border of Danchuan]

434
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,370
I’m not going.

435
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,140
I won't go.

436
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,160
Heroine, help!

437
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
How dare you hit a woman in Danchuan?

438
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,530
This is my wife.

439
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,530
Why are you interfering?

440
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,260
Come with me!

441
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,290
This bastard gambler

442
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,180
lost our house and land.

443
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,610
Now he wants to sell me.

444
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,970
You're selling your wife for money?

445
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,840
What a bastard!

446
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,930
This is among us.

447
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,770
Stay out of it!

448
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,500
Come with me.

449
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,340
Come with me.

450
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,680
You bitch!

451
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,950
Heroine, spare me. I won’t dare!

452
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,780
If I ever see you do this again,

453
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,900
I'll kill you.

454
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,760
Get lost!

455
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,240
Thank you, heroine.

456
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,030
Take the money.

457
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,410
I can't take this.

458
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,150
Take it.

459
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,510
Take the money and go.

460
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,140
Thank you, heroine.

461
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,520
Don’t. Get up.

462
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,220
He's not worth it.

463
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,300
Divorce him.

464
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,150
You can live by yourself.

465
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,030
That's her.

466
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,270
That bitch!

467
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,690
How dare you bully my buddy?

468
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,490
Fight!

469
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,370
I'm coming.

470
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,220
Thank you for your hard work, officers.

471
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,860
Now you can rest assured.

472
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,230
May you live a good life.

473
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,440
Take care.

474
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,080
They've been taken away.

475
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,200
By the way,

476
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,350
I've bought back all your weapons.

477
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,480
The Garden of Perseverance is gone.

478
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,140
I left them with Zheng for now.

479
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,260
It's written in my letter of repudiation.

480
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,190
Why are you here?

481
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,260
s left too soon.

482
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,120
You may not have known

483
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,960
that I went to Danchuan

484
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,440
for the son-in-law-recruiting competition.

485
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,500
I was talking about the repudiation.

486
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,620
That doesn't count.

487
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,750
You even misspelled my name.

488
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,010
I'm “Qi”,

489
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,510
not “Oi”.

490
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,750
That's not my letter of repudiation. I don't want it.

491
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,750
I wrote it for you.

492
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,810
I don't care how your name is spelled.

493
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,490
I don't care.

494
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,390
It doesn't count if I don't sign it.

495
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:42,920
Besides,

496
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,060
I have something to say to you.

497
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,480
Shangguan.

498
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,970
I lied to you about what I said last time.

499
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,410
I had nothing.

500
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,760
I was afraid that you'd suffer with me

501
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,890
and get implicated.

502
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,830
So I made up my mind that day

503
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:59,820
to kick you out.

504
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,680
But you didn't believe a thing I said.

505
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,940
So I said such nonsense

506
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,390
at the spur of the moment.

507
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,190
After you left, I regretted it.

508
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,449
I really regretted it.

509
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,060
I know I shouldn't have done that.

510
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,030
Li Wei and the others have judged me.

511
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,040
I was so stupid.

512
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,120
So I

513
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,810
have to come over and apologize to you in person.

514
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,550
I'm sorry.

515
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,770
I'm fine with my situation.

516
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,830
But I couldn't bear

517
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,770
to get you into trouble.

518
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,790
So you think

519
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,250
I just can't

520
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,630
share joy and sorrow with you, right?

521
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,810
That's not what I meant.

522
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

523
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,980
I know it's hard for you to forgive me.

524
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,449
But Li Wei was right to judge me.

525
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,110
No matter what I was thinking,

526
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,250
I couldn't say I liked someone else,

527
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,360
let alone she is your friend.

528
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,730
Okay.

529
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,290
You're done apologizing.

530
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,260
Can you leave now?

531
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,530
I...

532
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,270
I know I am

533
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,110
shameless.

534
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,110
But I'm kind of...

535
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,520
greedy.

536
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,440
I want to know

537
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,540
if you can ever forgive me.

538
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,540
Do I still have a chance?

539
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,450
It's okay.

540
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,670
You don't have to rush to answer me.

541
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,880
I've already thought about it.

542
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,670
I'll stay with you.

543
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,870
You can't kick me out.

544
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,550
I'll go if you don't.

545
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:18,930
By the way,

546
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,020
your hair.

547
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,970
What's wrong with my hair?

548
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,910
I mean.

549
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,200
Shangguan.

550
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,740
Listen.

551
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,330
I made it to match yours.

552
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,660
Don't you want to travel the world?

553
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,280
With so much being said,

554
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,080
including tax relief,

555
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,130
I'd like to ask, does this marriage

556
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,420
disgust Xinchuan so much

557
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,660
that you'd pay such a high price for a divorce?

558
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,470
Lord Jinchuan, you're mistaken.

559
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,050
It's my decision and Highness's to get divorced.

560
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,040
It has nothing to do with the two regions.

561
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
And the tax relief

562
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,920
is nothing but my token of sincerity.

563
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,610
It's a more permanent

564
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,490
and beneficial alliance than marriage.

565
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,020
It's good for both regions.

566
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,720
All you talk about are the pros and cons.

567
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,370
I now think

568
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,750
I've misjudged you.

569
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,350
Since you want to talk about the pros and cons,

570
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,010
I'll have a good talk with you.

571
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,910
You are Prince Zheng of Xinchuan.

572
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,040
After the divorce,

573
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,810
you still have plenty of chances.

574
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,230
And how much profit can she get

575
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,960
if my daughter gets remarried?

576
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,680
We can talk business.

577
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,600
But the divorce

578
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,370
is off the table.

Father.

580
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,600
Lord Xinchuan has agreed to this.

581
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
Why won't you say yes?

582
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,630

583
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,830
Who let you in?

584
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,810
You don't have the decency of a girl.

585
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,020
I've told you this.

586
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,660
There's no way.

587
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,590
Father.

588
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,850
Do we have to judge

589
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,040
the divorce and remarriage

590
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,410

591
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,830
Forgive me for doing this.

592
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,560
I want to divorce Prince Zheng.

593
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,130
I hope My Lord will allow it.

Yuan Ying.

596
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,260
Your father said not to mention this again.

597
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,580
Forgive me for doing this.

598
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,440
I want to divorce Prince Zheng.

599
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,940
I hope Father

600
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,130
be kind about this.

601
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,810
Someone.

602
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,400
Take the princess back.

603
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,810
Ground her

604
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,740
and let her think about it.

605
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,000
Lord Jinchuan, please think twice.

606
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,800
Prince Zheng.

607
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,090
I'm disciplining an unruly daughter who asks for a divorce.

608
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,510
If your marriage is secure,

609
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,640
I won't make things difficult for her.

I have some good alcohol for you.

614
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,620
Jinchuan guards never drink while on duty.

615
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,060
Please behave yourself, Your Ladyship.

616
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,370
That's very united.

617
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,650
It must be hard for you to be on duty all night long.

618
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,690
I've prepared some cakes for you…

619
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,870
Jinchuan guards do not eat late-night snacks.

620
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,470
It's neither good for health nor good for duty.

621
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,430
Good for Jinchuan.

622
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
I'll show my hand.

623
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,130
I just want to see the princess

624
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,160
and bring her something to eat.

625
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,000
She hasn't eaten much all day, has she?

626
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,180
I'll come out

627
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,280
after I see her, okay?

628
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,480
Jinchuan's guards can't disobey the rules

629
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,670
and just let people in without permission.

630
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,950
Besides, the princess of Jinchuan doesn't eat late at night.

Let me take it.

634
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,440
You don't like to copy these.

635
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,850
There is no need to pretend in front of me.

Jinchuan relies on trade with foreign countries.

Despite the suspicion of dumping

642
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,980
it can bring about domestic change.

643
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,340
Your father never liked your involvement in foreign affairs.

644
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,850
What's the use of doing it?

645
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,300
Besides, you're a woman.

646
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,930
Since Mother knows I can do a good job,

647
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,330
why can't you give me more chances?

648
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,670
Maybe

649
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,270
I can do much more for Jinchuan,

650
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,710

You get along well

you may be able to do what you want instead.

00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,740

660
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,300
Prince Zheng and I are the best of allies,

661
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,950
just like Xinchuan and Jinchuan.

662
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,130
In fact, we are the same kind of people.

663
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,660
As allies, we have a tacit understanding.

664
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,080
But as husband and wife,

665
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,250
I have no love for him at all.

666

670
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,670
I'll do what I want to do.

671
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,100
And I can do it well.

672
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,840
Why doesn't Father trust me?

673
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,040
Just because I'm a daughter?

674
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,100
It's not fair.

You didn't use to eat late at night.

677
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,020
Maybe it wouldn't hurt

678
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,070
