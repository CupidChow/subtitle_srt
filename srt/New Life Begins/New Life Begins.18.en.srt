00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,120
Xinchuan plans to help Mochuan with farming.

3
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,330
This also requires your approval.

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,880
Lord Xinchuan

5
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,080
will pay attention when it comes to you.

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
He will.

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,880
But I wonder how much attention he'll pay.

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,800
Zheng, don't be like this.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,920
We are friends.

10
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,800
That's right.

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,480
Friends.

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,320
Qiao,

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,360
as long as you're willing to help,

14
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
the two regions will both do you good.

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
You just need to send a message to the herdsmen of Mochuan.

16
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,240
We'll take care of the rest

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,120
for you.

18
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
But if this goes to the Lord

19
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,000
who asks Qiao to help,

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,680
it'll be a different thing.

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
That's right.

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
We're doing it for your sake.

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,720
In this case,

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,600
Qiao,

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,240
don't hold back.

26
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,600
I heard

27
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,960
what you said.

28
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,270
Let me think about it.

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,560
I really can't hold it in here.

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,880
Look at my sweaty face.

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,880
I need to take a leak first.

32
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,120
Excuse me.

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
I can't hold it.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,880
Qiao.

35
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,720
Prince An.

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
My brother Zheng

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
is a bit stubborn.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
But I'm not like him.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,520
I know what I'm doing.

40
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,850
I appreciate you, Qiao.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,320
When I meet Lord Mochuan in a few days,

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,240
I'll definitely

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
talk you up.

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,640
Okay.

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,080
You must do this.

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,240
Don't worry.

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,000
Prince An.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,480
I will

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,360
go and convince the herdsmen as you wish.

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,840
Okay?

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
That's right.

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,640
Now go to the toilet

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,300
before something goes wrong.

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,170
Stop the whistling, Prince An.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,560
How's that?

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
Did he make a good promise?

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,360
Pretty much.

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
It should be fine.

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
We worked so well together.

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,600
But Qi,

61
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,800
why were you always so slow in answering?

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,600
I couldn't stand it.

63
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,320
That's

64
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,760
good enough for me.

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm going to the field with big brother.

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,240
You two…

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,200
I have something personal to deal with.

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,070
I have to go.

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
I won't go either.

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,160
Take care on your way.

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,420
Let's go, big brother.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,840
What's wrong?

73
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
It didn't go well?

74
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,280
No.

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,840
It went well.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Then why are you so depressed?

77
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,840
I don't know what's wrong with me.

78
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,400
Today

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,400
I worked with

80
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,880
big brother,

81
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
An

82
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
and Zheng.

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
All the talk was like a show.

84
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,290
Someone played the bad guy,

85
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,920
and someone played the good guy.

86
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,890
It's even more complex than the fast mask-changing I did for you back in Danchuan.

87
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,560
We didn't speak straight,

88
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
acting for our own purposes.

89
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,680
You're not used to it?

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,080
I just feel tired.

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,040
My mother said

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
I've lacked this capacity since I was a child.

93
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,730
Now that I'm involved with the court affairs,

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,040
Father won't give me a position.

95
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,250
It's complicated in the court.

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,720
I still can't sort it out.

97
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,320
Zheng is more promising than me.

98
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,400
This may be

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,920
how my life is.

100
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,970
This is how your life is.

101
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,400
Isn't that good?

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
Since you're not used to it,

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,880
don't let yourself be.

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,400
There's not just one way to live.

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
They like to beat around the bush.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
Then you should say it directly.

107
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,560
If someone really gives you a hard time because of this,

108
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,420
I'll protect you with my weapons.

109
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,440
Wait.

110
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
You remind me of

111
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
a phrase by this.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
It describes

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,200
how I look proud

114
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,520
and swagger around

115
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,120
because of your preference.

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,480
How uneducated.

117
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,600
That's called “haught”.

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,160
That's right.

119
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,040
That's what it is.

120
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,240
Wait. I think

121
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,160
it's

122
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
“haughty”.

123
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
That's not important.

124
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,520
It's whatever you say it is.

125
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,560
From now on,

126
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm the haughty one because of your indulgence.

127
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Wait for me here.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Doctor.

129
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,680
Doctor.

130
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,720
Doctor.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,800
Doctor?

132
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,240
Doctor?

133
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,440
Are you sick?

134
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Who would come here if they weren't sick?

135
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,970
I have medicine.

136
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,400
Sit down.

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
You're not very good at that.

138
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,440
You're good.

139
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,960
You're outspoken.

140
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,420
It's good to be outspoken.

141
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,480
I heard you're a great doctor in this field

142
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,960
with an effective secret recipe.

143
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,600
So I came to visit you.

144
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,840
Where are you from?

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,760
Xinchuan.

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,480
A foreigner.

147
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,800
Someone easy to fool.

148
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,920
What?

149
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
I mean,

150
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
it's easy

151
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,210
to identify your sickness.

152
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Give me your hand.

153
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,680
I've written the prescription.

154
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,120
Just follow the prescription and get the medicine.

155
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,680
Okay.

156
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,160
Take it 300 times.

157
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,320
If it's not getting better,

158
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,360
come back to me.

159
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,200
Wait.

160
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,920
Doctor.

161
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,400
Although it's not easy for me to come to Mochuan,

162
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't think

163
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,480
I should take this much in one go.

164
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
You don't understand.

165
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
If you want to function well,

166
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
you have to keep taking it

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,560
as long as you don't die.

168
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,400
Got it?

169
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,920
Come on.

170
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,680
Money is not a problem

171
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,520
as long as it can be cured.

172
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,800
For hundreds of years,

173
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,560
Mochuan people have been grazing their livestock,

174
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,020
making the soil poor and the grass degraded.

175
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,880
But Mochuan is also a sparsely populated area

176
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,280
with long sunshine hours.

177
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,800
With proper planning

178
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,400
and fertilizing the fields,

179
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,680
someday

180
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,880
farming will flourish here.

181
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,280
I'll tell Lord Mochuan about this later.

182
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,200
Since Qiao has agreed to be in charge,

183
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,440
he'll convince the herdsmen

184
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,800
not just stick to the old ways.

185
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,560
They need both herding and farming.

186
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,600
That's the way to go.

187
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,400
That's right.

188
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,440
You're...

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
I saw the soil here is different from ours.

190
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
So I thought I'd give it a try.

191
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,600
Sure enough, the soil here is much harder than ours.

192
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
It's also more difficult to dig.

193
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,760
It's convenient to work

194
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,640
in this outfit.

195
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,160
All farmers dress like this.

196
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,040
Not everyone wears robes every day

197
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,970
like people in Xinchuan Palace do.

198
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,600
We're not well-informed.

199
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
It's already very rare

200
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,680
you're considerate of others.

201
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,440
How about

202
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,400
you give it a try?

203
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,280
Well…

204
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,360
Prince,

205
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
try it yourself.

206
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
Harder.

207
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,680
Dig deeper.

208
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,920
Turn up the raw soil underneath

209
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,960
and let the sun shine on it,

210
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,760
so that it'll turn into mellow soil.

211
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,560
It greatly enhances fertility.

212
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,880
Your Ladyship is really good.

213
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,080
You know everything.

214
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,760
Prince Zheng is the best.

215
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
He can learn everything.

216
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
What have you drawn?

217
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,880
I found out

218
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,160
the plows here are too old.

219
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,520
It's hard and inefficient to use.

220
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
See?

221
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,960
I want to add a square iron box

222
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,720
in the middle,

223
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,760
so that the seeds in the box

224
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,520
will go directly into the soil

225
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,880
as the farmer plows.

226
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,440
When the plowing is done,

227
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,960
the seeds will be sown too.

228
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,080
Where did you get the inspiration?

229
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,000
I watched people planting

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,200
in Jichuan.

231
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,880
I wondered if I could plow and plant at the same time.

232
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,680
That would be a great way to kill two birds with one stone.

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,080
But it was just a thought.

234
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,020
I didn't know if it would work.

235
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,120
I'll ask my big brother to make it.

236
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,160
If it works,

237
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,320
I'll present it to Lord Mochuan

238
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,440
along with my farming report.

239
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,640
Really?

240
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,480
Come on.

241
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Lord Mochuan has finally agreed to our proposal.

242
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,000
From now on,

243
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,040
we no longer need intermarriage to maintain our connection.

244
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,080
That's great.

245
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,000
Now everything is settled.

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,040
Your trip was not in vain.

247
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:22,920
Yes.

248
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,680
The liquor hasn't been wasted.

249
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,280
Now that we're done with our business,

250
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,000
guys,

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,680
let's spend a few more days in Mochuan.

252
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,480
Where do you want to go?

253
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,440
I'll arrange it.

254
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,360
I do know a place.

255
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,160
But

256
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
we can just go by ourselves.

257
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,280
Where?

258
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,640
Take a guess.

259
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,640
Grandpa!

260
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,080
The snow is so beautiful.

261
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,280
Wei.

262
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,680
Grandpa!

263
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Wei.

264
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,520
Wei.

265
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,080
Why are you doing so much work by yourself?

266
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Where is my uncle?

267
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,240
Your uncle has gone to his wife's home

268
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
with the children.

269
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
They'll be back in a few days.

270
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,880
Why did you suddenly go back to Mochuan?

271
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,540
You didn't tell me in advance.

272
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,610
And you brought so many guests?

273
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,540
This must be my grandson-in-law.

274
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,410
This is the first time I see you.

275
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,720
Grandpa.

276
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,080
This is the Fifth Prince.

277
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
The Fifth Prince?

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,080
I'm Yin Zheng, Prince Zheng of Xinchuan,

279
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,320
your grandson-in-law,

280
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,720
here to meet Grandpa.

281
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm old.

282
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,320
I recognized the wrong person.

283
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
They say

284
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,200
my grandson-in-law is weak.

285
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,000
So I thought it was him.

286
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,440
I told you.

287
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,640
He couldn't think it was me.

288
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,520
You?

289
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,280
My granddaughter couldn't possibly have fallen for you.

290
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,080
Is that so?

291
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,800
Grandpa.

292
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
We're all hungry.

293
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
What do we have to eat?

294
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,920
You little girl.

295
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,240
You haven't changed.

296
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,040
All you think about is food.

297
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,880
Let's go

298
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
for food!

299
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,760
Look at you.

300
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,080
You're too skinny.

301
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
Just make yourselves full here.

302
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,960
Let's go.

303
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,800
Let's go eat.

304
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:02,960
You…

305
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,040
Hurry up.

306
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,320
Hurry up.

307
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
Come on.

308
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,560
Grandpa.

309
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,920
You're an adult now.

310
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,200
Why are you still acting like a child?

311
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,360
I am a child.

312
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,200
You are.

313
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,760
Let's go.

314
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,960
Go eat with Grandpa.

315
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,600
Let's go eat.

316
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,960
Come on, Shangguan.

317
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,800
Have some of this first.

318
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Let me peel some peanuts for you.

319
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,480
Stop touching.

320
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,810
You don't have muscles.

321
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,840
You don't know that.

322
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,560
Zheng is as fit as me,

323
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
and good at martial arts.

324
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,960
On our way to Jinchuan,

325
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,560
he took down a bunch of people with a swish.

326
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,080
Come on.

327
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,600
Don't be embarrassed.

328
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,440
Is it true?

329
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
Of course it's true.

330
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,000
But you instead,

331
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,080
you haven't learned a single move

332
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,640
from Shangguan Jing?

333
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,240
You look shaky.

334
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,880
I mean, An.

335
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,440
Since we came to Mochuan,

336
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,680
we've been drinking every day.

337
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,160
How many days have I been sober?

338
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,120
I don't have time to practice.

339
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,680
Am I right?

340
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,000
But I think it's a great chance

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,280
that we come here.

342
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,000
At least we don't have to drink.

343
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,520
Right?

344
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,160
That's true.

345
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,760
Come on.

346
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,440
We can have a nice home-cooked meal.

347
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,760
Yes.

348
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,640
No alcohol.

349
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,370
That's good.

350
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,400
Here we go.

351
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,000
You've come all the way to Mochuan.

352
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,660
You're all honorable guests.

353
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Um…

354
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
This is my best liquor.

355
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,760
Tonight you can drink as much as you like.

356
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,800
After that,

357
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,400
you can spend the night here.

358
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,920
No, no, no.

359
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,000
What's so bad about it?

360
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,920
Come on.

361
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,720
It's enough.

362
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,180
Enough.

363
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,440
Enough?

364
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,320
Come on.

365
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,760
Girls don't have to drink that much.

366
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Come on.

367
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,440
A little.

368
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,520
A little of what?

369
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,240
Come.

370
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,760
Grandson-in-law.

371
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,180
Don't drink that much.

372
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,880
I'll have some of this too.

373
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,560
Come on.

374
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,620
Let's have a toast.

375
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,720
Cheers.

376
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Six!

377
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Seven!

378
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,120
Bad luck!

379
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,280
All come!

380
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,400
Eight nines!

381
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
All come!

382
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,760
Six!

383
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,640
Seven!

384
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,280
Eight!

385
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,200
Drink.

386
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,120
Bad luck!

387
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,240
I can still drink.

388
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,760
Shangguan.

389
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,400
I can still drink.

390
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I can still drink.

391
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,720
Go to sleep.

392
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,400
Grandpa, let's continue later.

393
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,109
I can still drink.

394
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,400
Why is he getting drunk so quickly?

395
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,760
I haven't had enough yet.

396
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Grandpa.

397
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,589
He can't hold the liquor.

398
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,160
Let me play with you.

399
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,200
You'll do it?

400
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,480
Let's see.

401
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,960
Good, let's see.

402
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,280
Six!

403
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,240
Seven!

404
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,200
Nine!

405
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,720
Drink.

406
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,280
Grandpa.

407
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,040
You're really good.

408
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,880
You're good at finger-guessing.

409
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
You've taken good care of your body.

410
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,880
You don't look like

411
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
an old man at all.

412
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,040
Do you have any secrets?

413
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,080
Can you share it with me?

414
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,000
If I have your body

415
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,440
when I reach your age,

416
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,360
I will have no regrets.

417
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,440
There is no secret.

418
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,080
You just have to

419
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,240
exercise well.

420
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,160
You know?

421
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,250
Especially you two.

422
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,960
I'm expecting a grandchild,

423
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,220
so I can have four generations together.

424
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,280
Come on.

425
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,480
Grandson-in-law.

426
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,680
Take more tonic.

427
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,440
Have a good body.

428
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,000
Grandpa, you're drunk.

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
What do you mean I'm drunk?

430
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,960
Don't you know me?

431
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,240
I can have

432
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,000
at least ten jars of this.

433
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,960
Come on.

434
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,760
Come on.

435
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,960
Grandpa.

436
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,400
I have to go out.

437
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're going to escape.

438
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,760
Want to run?

439
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,680
Isn't it?

440
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,800
You said

441
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,930
we should exercise.

442
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,920
Wait for me here.

443
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,080
Grandson-in-law.

444
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,800
They can't do it.

445
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,930
Let's do it you and I.

446
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,800
Grandpa.

447
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,520
He doesn't know about it.

448
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,440
Let me play with you.

449
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,400
Why are you interrupting?

450
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,840
I'm drinking with my grandson-in-law.

451
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,200
Come on, grandson-in-law.

452
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,920
I'll play with Grandpa.

453
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,720
Two!

454
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,080
Five!

455
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,880
Um…

456
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,800
I win.

457
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,440
Come again.

458
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,040
Two!

459
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,520
Six!

460
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,480
It's a fluke.

461
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,920
Again.

462
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Two!

463
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,360
Six!

464
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,880
You're flattering me.

465
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,280
Prince Zheng is lucky.

466
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
When did you learn finger-guessing?

467
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,400
You're good.

468
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,880
Didn't you notice that Grandpa

469
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,400
made either three or five

470
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,600
and never changed?

471
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,820
Grandson-in-law.

472
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,260
I don't believe it.

473
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,560
Let's do it again.

474
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,760
Let's do it again.

475
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,880
Two!

476
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,120
Six!

477
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,360
Six!

478
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,040
I caught you, didn't I?

479
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,560
You want to set me up?

480
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,160
Drink.

481
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,600
Drink.

482
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,760
You made him hear it on purpose

483
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,800
so he can win, right?

484
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,920
Don't drink this.

485
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,640
If you want to be my grandson-in-law…

486
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,520
Drink.

487
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,480
You have to drink like this.

488
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,640
Good.

489
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
You can't cheat an old man's liquor.

490
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Wei.

491
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,000
Tell me the truth.

492
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,040
Have you had a good time in Xinchuan

493
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,600
this year?

494
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,420
Don't worry, Grandpa.

495
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,320
I'm doing very well in Xinchuan.

496
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,440
Although there are more rules in Xinchuan than back home,

497
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm getting used to it.

498
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,170
I won't be a disgrace to our family.

499
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,200
Don't think about

500
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
being a disgrace.

501
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,160
Wherever you go,

502
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,600
you are a family.

503
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,920
People talk about family all the time.

504
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,600
What is family?

505
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,560
They

506
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,880
head toward a good future

507
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,640
and overcome difficulties together.

508
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,560
You know?

509
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
I think Prince Zheng

510
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,560
cares about you.

511
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,000
You have to

512
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,600
support each other

513
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,960
and live a good life.

514
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,720
You still have a long way to go.

515
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,560
Our family is your backbone.

516
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,560
Take care of yourself.

517
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,160
Don't worry about us.

518
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,400
Okay.

519
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,720
Right.

520
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,760
Wait a minute.

521
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,880
Grandpa has something for you.

522
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,720
Here.

523
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,040
This is...

524
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,440
This is my treasure.

525
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Take it.

526
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,520
This

527
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,720
was your grandma's dowry.

528
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,280
When she was still alive,

529
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,760
she gave all her dowry to your mother and your aunt,

530
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,480
except for this bracelet.

531
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,960
After she's gone,

532
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,800
I've taken this as a reminder.

533
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,320
Now

534
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm getting older,

535
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,440
I'll

536
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,560
give it to you.

537
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,200
This means too much.

538
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,160
I can't take it.

539
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
You can have it.

540
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,280
I don't have anything of value.

541
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,200
Besides,

542
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,520
now that you're married,

543
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,480
you'll have to use your husband's money after all.

544
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,680
Keep this bracelet with you.

545
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,520
If something happens,

546
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,240
you can sell it,

547
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,130
so you won't have to ask for money from others.

548
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,920
Thank you, Grandpa.

549
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,760
Our Wei

550
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,320
has grown up.

551
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,560
In a blink of an eye,

552
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,200
you're now married.

553
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
I'm getting old too.

554
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,080
Grandpa is not old.

555
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,690
Grandpa will always be mighty and strong.

556
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,520
Mighty and strong.

557
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,760
Wei.

558
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,000
I really like

559
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,680
my grandson-in-law.

560
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,080
But he seems

561
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,760
a bit weak.

562
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,480
He just looks thin.

563
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,400
Actually, he exercises a lot.

564
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,720
He is in a good shape.

565
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,800
You're very protective of him.

566
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,960
But

567
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,000
it's good.

568
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,720
If he's weak,

569
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,040
he can't beat me.

570
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,400
If he doesn't treat you right,

571
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,280
Grandpa can revenge you.

572
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,840
Your father

573
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,640
can't beat me with his thin body.

574
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,080
With his body condition,

575
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,360
I can just slap him

576
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,440
to Jichuan.

577
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,120
All these years,

578
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320
he never dared to treat your mother badly.

579
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Grandpa.

580
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,640
Grandpa.

581
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,200
Our Wei

582
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,000
has grown up.

583
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,920
I wanted to wake you up for some soup to sober up.

584
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,860
Why did you wake up on your own?

585
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,160
I didn't wipe my face.

586
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,800
I have to wipe your face before going to bed.

587
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,040
This is for wiping the table,

588
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,240
not your face.

589
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,920
Soup.

590
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,680
Thank you, wifie.

591
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,520
You're crying.

592
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,700
Why are you crying?

593
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,360
I'm just a little homesick.

594
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,460
From now on, whenever you want to go home,

595
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,080
I'll take you home.

596
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,600
Why are you laughing?

597
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,600
You knew you couldn't drink.

598
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,130
But you still drank so much.

599
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,450
Don't you know what you'll do if you get drunk?

600
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
I know.

601
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,200
Then why…

602
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,960
Don't even think about it!

603
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,730
You heartless bastard.

604
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,840
I'm sure you'll forget this

605
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,300
tomorrow when you wake up.

606
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,220
From now on, whenever you want to go home,

607
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,760
I'll take you home.

608
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,440
I'll take you home.

609
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,400
Your trip to Mochuan this time

610
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,800
has resulted in a new alliance between Xinchuan and Sichuan.

611
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,520
You did a great job.

612
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,400
Thank you, My Lord.

613
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,240
This is what I should do.

614
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,080
Thank you, My Lord.

615
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,880
This is also what I should do.

616
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,960
My Lord.

617
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,200
The Third Prince is not feeling well.

618
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
He's asked for a break today.

619
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,480
I have something else to say.

620
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,200
Since the Sixth Prince Yin Zheng

621
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,760
came to court,

622
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,120
he has been sophisticated and responsible.

623
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,880
I now appoint Yin Zheng

624
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
to assist the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

625
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,040
In the future,

626
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,200
you shall be more diligent

627
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,400
and not slack off.

628
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,120
Prince Zheng.

629
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,220
My Lord, thank you for your kindness.

630
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,960
The trial launch of new coins at several markets went well

631
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,800
during the time that Zheng was in Mochuan.

632
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,320
Although the Department of Revenue did it,

633
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,180
Zheng should take a lot of credit.

634
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,560
Why did Father

635
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,800
assign him to the Nine Regions Affairs Division?

636
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,960
The Department of Revenue is about life and death.

637
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,880
Of course, I should have it in my hands.

638
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,680
How can others interfere?

639
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,880
Yes.

640
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,680
You're the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

641
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,440
You're supposed to be in charge of it.

642
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,040
Zheng can't get in the way.

643
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,800
But Zheng

644
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,760
has been at the court for less than six months,

645
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,820
and he's already assisting the Nine Regions Division.

646
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,240
It's a greater favor

647
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,800
than mine back then.

648
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,880
We need to

649
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,120
keep a closer eye on him.

650
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,440
Yes.

651
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,940
Mochuan has given their word.

652
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,040
I heard it was your idea.

653
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,400
Yes.

654
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,620
It's just a matter of duty.

655
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,280
Mother has something to say?

656
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,680
You've failed to show restraint in the court,

657
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,640
attracting other people's attention.

658
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,040
I'm afraid you and Yin Zai may get involved.

659
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,140
That's not necessarily a good thing.

660
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,360
I know you know this.

661
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,770
I won't go into details.

662
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,760
There is another thing I want to hear your opinions about.

663
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,760
I heard that Madam Chun has sent Princess Linlang

664
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,920
to her grandparents' house for a while.

665
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,980
She'll be brought back in a few years.

666
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,720
Song Wu is old enough to get married.

667
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,300
Although the intermarriage is done,

668
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,440
I want her marriage

669
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,080
to settle as soon as possible

670
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,810
in case of any further complications.

671
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,280
I understand.

672
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,720
She

673
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,960
has always liked you.

674
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,000
You were childhood friends.

675
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,200
If you could get married,

676
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,040
it would be a good thing.

677
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,480
I don't know if I'm not being obvious or

678
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,760
you don't know me well.

679
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,320
I only think of Song Wu as my sister.

680
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
I see.

681
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,200
Fine.

682
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,400
Song Wu deserves someone who treats her wholeheartedly.

683
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,720
I'll pay attention.

684
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,620
You can also help to look for the right person

685
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,280
when you're out and about.

686
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,440
Yes.

687
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,160
Well...

688
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,400
I'll leave now.

689
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,280
Prince.

690
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,720
Has the Lord decided on a formal position

691
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,480
for you in the court today?

692
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,400
But it's not

693
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,360
what you think.

694
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,640
I've been appointed to assist the Nine Regions Division.

695
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,840
The Nine Regions Affairs Division?

696
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,160
It's probably to prevent you

697
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,920
from overshadowing the Second Prince.

698
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,120
But

699
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,320
the Lord is serious about

700
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,520
your idea of opening up the market

701
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,600
and issuing tokens.

702
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,520
That means

703
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,160
he approves of you in.

704
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,960
Although it's not what you expected,

705
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,560
it doesn't matter

706
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,080
at this stage.

707
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,520
I can't believe you're comforting me.

708
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,640
Has your heart gone softened

709
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,840
after spending a lot of time with Li Wei?

710
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,200
Who's talking about me?

711
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,370
I've prepared some snacks.

712
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,320
You didn't eat before the court meeting.

713
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,120
Have some.

714
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,800
Why are you so quiet?

715
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,120
Did something happen at the court?

716
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,080
It's nothing.

717
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,560
If you don't say it,

718
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,000
Li Wei will overthink it.

719
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Share the storm.

720
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,240
Tell her what happened.

721
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,840
That's the way to last.

722
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
Okay.

723
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,000
I've been appointed to an official position.

724
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,080
What official position?

725
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
The Nine Regions Affairs Division.

726
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,230
What is it?

727
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,190
Just

728
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,670
an official.

729
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,710
Is it a big job?

730
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,670
Not bad.

731
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,600
Are you in charge of a lot of people?

732
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,710
Are you Jingwei

733
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,739
who is ready to fill the ocean?

734
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,560
Madam He sent a list of names.

735
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,080
She wants Miss to get engaged.

736
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,280
Miss

737
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,520
has the body of the Queen

738
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,800
and the fate of an old maid.

739
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,960
She didn't like a single one of them.

740
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,489
What are you talking about?

741
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,960
You don't like those men either.

742
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,880
A woman just wants to marry the one she likes.

743
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,280
And it's hard to achieve

744
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
such a small wish.

745
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,840
I'm looking for

746
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,000
a man

747
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,120
who I see as everything

748
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,280
and who sees me as everything.

749
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,280
As for the origin

750
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,480
and money,

751
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,440
they don't matter at all.

752
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,280
I didn't expect

753
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,000
you have the same idea

754
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,200
as Jichuan people on this.

755
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,720
But actually

756
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,280
when the marriage was in front of me,

757
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,640
I realized

758
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,400
the way I felt about Zheng

759
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,840
was admiration at most.

760
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,640
I don't really want to marry him.

761
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,400
Unlike you,

762
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
who is so desperately in love.

763
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,360
I'm not.

764
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,640
But he actually likes you.

765
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,280
I don't think I should admire him anymore

766
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,360
for his taste.

767
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,840
I...

768
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm a bit upset at most.

769
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,120
I'm obviously the best.

770
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,690
But he likes you. You're so unattractive.

771
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,080
No personal attacks.

772
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,600
My father said

773
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm the most beautiful girl in Jichuan.

774
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,800
Your father said that?

775
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,200
And you believe him?

776
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,120
If you trust me,

777
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,000
I can help you.

778
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,200
Madam.

779
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,650
Excuse yourselves.

780
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,200
You came to see me

781
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,560
for Song Wu's marriage, isn't it?

782
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,600
Wu.

783
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,440
You are a girl.

784
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,740
It's not proper to interfere with the marriage.

785
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,660
Madam, please forgive me.

786
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,640
After all, this is about Song Wu's life.

787
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
She doesn't want to be

788
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,800
casually appointed to someone

789
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,920
and hastily live out her life.

790
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
That's why we're here to see you.

791
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,360
Sit down.

792
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,520
Go ahead.

793
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,880
I...

794
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,880
Actually, I...

795
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,240
Come on. Go ahead.

796
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,760
I know

797
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,240
Godmother is doing it for my good.

798
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,000
But if it's not someone I like,

799
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,280
I wouldn't be happy

800
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,040
even if I marry the Lord.

801
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Talk. Not wild talk.

802
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,640
Madam.

803
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Take no offense.

804
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,480
She didn't mean that.

805
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,800
Don't take it to heart.

806
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,960
Wu.

807
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,290
I've watched you grow up

808
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,460
and thought of you as my own daughter.

809
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,000
I mean to make your deceased parents rest assured

810
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,400
by arranging a marriage for you.

811
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,280
If you are really unhappy,

812
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,040
I'm sure they would be upset too.

813
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,800
So let's do what you want

814
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,760
with your marriage.

815
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,560
Really?

816
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,060
Thank you, Godmother.

817
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,640
I hope he cares about you.

818
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,520
But as an unmarried lady,

819
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,120
I don't think you can go around looking for men.

820
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,480
I do have an idea.

821
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,000
What is it?

822
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,520
Bind date.

823
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,680
My father is the general of Xinchuan Military Department.

824
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,640
My mother

825
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
is the daughter of Ministry Councilor Wang.

826
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,480
I heard your father

827
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,240
was the famous General Song of Xinchuan.

828
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,360
You're a good match for me.

829
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,960
After we get married,

830
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,280
you don't have to do anything.

831
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,880
Just stay at home and give birth to my son and bring him up.

832
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,320
And then have another son and bring him up.

833
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,960
And then have another son and bring him up.

834
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Wait.

835
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,080
Sir,

836
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,800
with so much being said,

837
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,080
don't you feel thirsty?

838
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,480
I am a little thirsty.

839
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,560
Give me some tea.

840
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,680
Where is your hand?

841
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,720
My hands?

842
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,840
How can I do such things with my hands?

843
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,400
My hands are for defending our country.

844
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,520
Princess, have you already eaten?

845
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,720
Yes, I do.

846
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,080
What did you eat?

847
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,360
Roast duck.

848
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,480
Is it the kind that comes in a burrito?

849
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,880
Do you put shredded cucumber,

850
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,920
shredded radish

851
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,570
or shredded green onion

852
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,040
in roast duck burrito?

853
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,560
I put hawthorn strips.

854
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,840
You like sweet food.

855
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,800
Princess.

856
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,000
It's your turn to ask me what I ate.

857
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,200
Are you satisfied with what you see?

858
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
I...

859
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,360
I understand.

860
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,440
I understand it.

861
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,160
You've got a crush on me.

862
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,600
That's not true.

863
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,880
You don't have to fight against your feelings.

864
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,200
Girls,

865
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,720
they say one thing

866
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,400
and mean another.

867
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
In fact,

868
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,120
I don't meet with women alone.

869
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,800
Once those women

870
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,560
see me,

871
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,090
they can't get enough of me.

872
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,720
You don't have to come.

873
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,360
I don't have to see you either.

874
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,160
Naughty.

875
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,240
Your eyes can't lie.

876
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,800
My eyes?

877
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,040
What eyes?

878
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,040
The look of adoration.

879
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,120
I'm about to collapse.

880
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,360
The ladies of the palace

881
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
handpicked

882
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,520
those gentlemen.

883
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,400
You're not satisfied with them all?

884
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Don't be too picky, Miss.

885
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,460
There is no perfect man in this world.

886
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,880
I can't lower my requirement

887
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,880
to any man, right?

888
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,360
Princess.

889
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,640
Here comes a good one.

890
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,960
Help.

891
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
I don't want to go.

892
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,480
I found you

893
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,640
a perfect one this time.

894
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,840
Nanny Liu.

895
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,560
I'm asking too much.

896
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,760
I'll tell you the truth.

897
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
I don't like

898
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,440
any of the ones you've found.

899
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,160
I just want to have the perfect one.

900
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,120
I deserve to be single in my life.

901
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,200
That's good.

902
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,240
The perfect Tenth Prince.

903
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,240
Wait.

904
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,520
I mean.

905
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,280
This table is too big.

906
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
We're too far away from each other.

907
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,120
Come up here.

908
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,920
Sit here.

909
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,520
Closer,

910
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,440
so we can communicate.

911
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,380
Don't be so formal.

912
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,570
Just treat me like a normal person.

913
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,840
Here, have some melon seeds.

914
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,640
Peanuts.

915
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,900
It's good for the face.

916
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,600
Song Wu, Princess Kening, right?

917
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,680
You're quite good-looking.

918
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,160
But you're kind of

919
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,200
old.

920
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,610
Should I leave then?

921
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,240
That's okay.

922
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,320
My mother said

923
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,040
an older girl like you

924
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,200
is mature and caring.

925
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,400
Thank your mother.

926
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,040
By the way,

927
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,080
my mother is Madam Chuan.

928
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,280
You know that, right?

929
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,200
Of course.

930
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,720
Who doesn't?

931
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,240
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

932
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,370
It's good that you know.

933
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,320
My mother said you're good at flower arranging and sewing, right?

934
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,040
Great.

935
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,520
My mother always thought

936
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,400
a woman should stay at home.

937
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Be a good wife and mother.

938
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,240
Congratulations.

939
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,040
You meet my mother's standards.

940
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,560
I dare to ask, Prince Yue.

941
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,400
You said

942
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,160
you're looking for a wife

943
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,680
based on your mother's criteria?

944
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,240
Of course,

945
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,480
Who is my mother?

946
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,800
That's Madam Chuan.

947
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,160
She surely has the best criteria.

948
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
Besides, my mother must be doing it for my good.

949
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,920
Am I right?

950
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,680
I dare to ask you again, Prince Yue.

951
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,480
I mean.

952
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,760
If we do become a couple

953
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,520
and I have a problem with Madam Chuan,

954
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,240
what will you do?

955
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,040
Why did you ask?

956
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,040
How dare you

957
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,600
disobey my mother?

958
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,640
I mean if.

959
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,320
There is no such if.

960
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,800
Once you marry into our family,

961
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,080
you are a member of us.

962
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,240
You have to be good to me.

963
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,600
You have to be good to my mother.

964
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,320
Let's take a step back.

965
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,760
Even if this happens,

966
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,200
it must not be my mother's fault.

967
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,400
Even if it's my mother's fault,

968
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
I have to be on her side.

969
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:00,840
Right?

970
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,360
My mother carried me to term.

971
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,840
It was hard to give birth to me and raise me.

972
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,800
We have to be good to my mother.

973
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,600
Besides, how can you…

974
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,680
Prince Yue.

975
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,200
Please enjoy your meal.

976
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,880
I have something to do.

977
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,920
Excuse me.

978
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,280
What?

979
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,240
I haven't finished my speech.

980
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,720
I say.

981
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
Stop right there!

982
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,680
My mother said

983
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,410
it's rude to leave the table without permission.

984
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,720
Your mother was right.

985
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,720
I am rude

986
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,600
to leave the table without permission.

987
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,720
I'm not good enough for you.

988
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,440
I'm sorry.

989
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,040
Excuse me.

990
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,840
You're done so soon?

991
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,280
Where's the nearest nunnery?

992
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,360
What are you doing there?

993
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,760
To become a nun.
