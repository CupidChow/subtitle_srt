00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,400
This is a Water Banquet.

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,220
My Lord.

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,449
Your Ladyship.

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,220

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:09,639
Rise.

[Cangchuan]

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,579
Every lady has her own specialties in her hometown.

13
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,280
So,

14
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,020
we asked them

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,730
to prepare special dishes

16
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
and turn them into this banquet.

17
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,030
I really don't know why a concubine

18
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,680
can speak in public in front of the noble.

19
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,100
It doesn't matter.

20
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,329
I think it's quite interesting.

21
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,980
I think so too.

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,460
Go on.

23
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,340
This is a family banquet rather than a palace banquet.

24
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,570
When family members have a meal together,

25
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,400
if we pay too much attention to courtesy, we can only eat the food in front of us.

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,460
It's restraining.

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,110
Everyone has his own preferences.

28
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,170
Some like sweet food,

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
and some like spicy food.

30
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,650
So this time we've prepared delicious food from nine regions.

31
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,240
You can choose what you like

32
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,130
before entering the palace.

33
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:17,960
Sure.

34
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,310
My Lord, Your Ladyship,

35
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,750
go choose this way.

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,329
This is good.

37
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,070
This is good.

38
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,440
Look at the color.

39
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,730
This crab.

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,130
Shrimp.

41
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,090
This is Zai's favorite.

42
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,800
Look.

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,140
Not bad.

44
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,280
This Danchuan...

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,070
Prince Qi and Lady Jing made this together.

46
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,540
Lady Jing is from Danchuan.

47
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,800
Danchuan is rainy and wet,

48
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,090
so Danchuan people like chilies and peppers

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
to get rid of coldness and dampness.

50
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,600
I didn't expect that your trick

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,580
would make them work together.

52
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,130
You cut such a big piece of chicken.

53
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,710
I have told you that it's not easy to cook.

54
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,470
You cook it.

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,480
Show me.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,070
I have told you that I don't know how to cook.

57
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,070
You talk too much.

58
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,649
How can you add sugar to spicy dishes?

59
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:20,890
How many times have I told you?

60
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,019
The cook in your yard

61
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,050
adds sugar to dishes every day.

62
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,830
Can't you change it?

63
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,370
Danchuan people like pungent and spicy food.

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,050
Why is there only chili but no peppers?

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,440
Is it improved?

66
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,280
The green pepper in Danchuan is indeed famous,

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,800
but there is no such ingredient in Xinchuan.

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,370
Why?

69
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,320
The green pepper easily gets damp and is hard to preserve.

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,960
Transferred from Danchuan to Xinchuan,

71
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,080
it loses its original spicy fragrance.

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,070
In this case,

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,840
we need to build up the land transportation in Danchuan as soon as possible.

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,100
I've sent someone to handle this matter.

75
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,850
After their field inspection,

76
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,510
we will build it up as soon as possible.

77
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,710
You are wise, Father.

78
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,650
What are these?

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,110
Fangru made these.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,820
My Lord, Your Ladyship, please have a taste.

81
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,690
What kind of a bad idea Zheng has!

82
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,880
He insists on holding a nine-region food feast.

83
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
Fangru doesn't know how to cook.

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,020
Hao Jia,

85
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,450
why don't you do it?

86
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,160
Then we will send it in the name of Fangru.

87
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,760
What?

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,280
Why don't you kowtow?

89
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,310
This is an award for you.

90
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,580
Thank you, My Lord.

91
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,370
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

92
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,680
Prince Song's concubine, Hao Jia, helped a lot too.

93
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,540
She is also excellent in carving.

94
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,000
Is this the begonia fruit from Cangchuan?

95
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,230
An,

96
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,159
your wife is from Cangchuan too, right?

97
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,610
Yes, Father.

98
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,080

Apple.

100
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,690
Add it.

101
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,180
Come on.

102
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,250
Haitang,

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
we don't need to add any more, right?

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,630
It's almost going to overflow.

105
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,880
Have you ever thought that

106
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,240
if we cook it so quickly,

107
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,200
can we stay in the kitchen any more?

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,270
Do you want to go back and look at An's face?

109
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,640
Should we add more?

110
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,080
Yes.

111
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,780
Let's move!

112
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,520
Cangchuan lacks resources.

113
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Only begonia fruit is the most famous.

114
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,890
The fruit dish is made with begonia fruit

115
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,990
and other special fruits.

116
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,380
Cangchuan is drought and barren.

117
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,680
Agricultural development is extremely difficult there.

118
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,290
We need help Cangchuan more in the future.

119
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,320
My Lord, I thank you on behalf of the people of Cangchuan.

120
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,020
Rise.

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,120
By the way,

122
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,850
are these all your ideas?

123
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,909
This is my idea,

124
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,620
but we prepared these dishes together.

125
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,210
Well done.

126
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,730
What reward do you want?

127
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,550
May I

128
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,260
ask for your permission

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,930
to meet my family

130
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,230
after the Mid-Autumn Festival?

131
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
OK. I approve.

132

Rise.

134
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,560
Alright.

135
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,440
Everyone, choose the food

136
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,900
and have dinner with me in the palace.

137
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,040
Yes.

138
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,580
You chose it.

139
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Why haven't Prince Qi and Jing come?

140
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,220
They must be arguing again.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,580
The banquet held by Zheng and his wife today

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
is really interesting.

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,530
Well done.

144
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,370
This is what I should do.

145
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,250
If the palace is as lively as today,

146
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,700
we will feel at home.

147
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,260
All right.

148
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,150
Don't be restrained.

149
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
Just enjoy yourself.

I wish for family peace and tranquility of the world.

155

Come on. Let's drink.

161
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,200
Are they your biological mother and your wife?

162
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,680
Shall I go with you to propose a toast to her?

163
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,980
She won't want me to go.

164
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,370

[The Eleventh Prince, Zai]

166
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,760
Father, wish you good health on Mid-Autumn Festival.

167
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,540
Good health.

168
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,430
Good health.

169
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,880
Wish everyone good health.

170
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,340
Come on.

171
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,770
Good boy.

172
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,190
Have some crabs.

173
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
Put some down.

174
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,620
Two more pieces.

175
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,000
My family has barbecue in the yard every Mid-Autumn Festival.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,960
If we don't have barbecue this year, I will feel that something's missing.

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,010
You two haven't eaten enough, have you?

178
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,870
Let me show you.

179
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,350
You are awesome, Madam.

180
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,510
Fan it.

181
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,520
Be gentle.

182
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,480
Are you sure that you didn't make a mistake?

183
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,280
They brought charcoal into the palace.

184
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,610
I didn't make a mistake.

185
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,550
Just wait.

186
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,120
The show is coming.

188
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,210
Let me try it.

189
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,050
I want it too.

190
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,030
Corn.

191
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,250
Take them all.

192
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,000
Take all the meat skewers away.

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,060
They smell so good.

194
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,840
Why is the fire so strong?

195
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,120
Madam.

196
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,710
There are only a few pieces of charcoal. Seriously?

197
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,110
Hurry to put out the fire.

198
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,280
Don't fan it. Get the water.

199
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,020
Let's go.

200
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,140
Why is the fire so strong?

201
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,070
Put it out!

202
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,820
Put it out!

203
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,770
Here's the water.

204
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,040
Hurry up. The water is coming.

205
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,900
Hurry up. We are waiting for you.

206
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,160
We're counting on you.

207
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,860
What are you doing?

208
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,630
[Palace of Peace]

209
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,760
You should be punished severely for what you did today

210
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,860
according to the rules of the palace.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,930
Yes, Godmother.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,320
Li Wei intentionally committed arson.

213
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
It's a serious crime to harm the palace.

214
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
We should kick her out of the palace.

215
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,850
Why is the fire so strong?

216
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,540
There are only a few pieces of charcoal. Seriously?

217
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,400
Ms Song Wu, you're quick-witted.

218
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,440
You've planned to kick me out of the palace.

219
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,180
Madam He,

220
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,440
I am afraid that someone has done something to my charcoal.

221
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,160
I have only used a few pieces of charcoal.

222
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,990
How can they cause such a big fire?

223
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,920
This is strange.

224
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,640
Madam He, please investigate it thoroughly.

225
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,680
Don't slander me.

226
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,510
I didn't do it.

227
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,150
Godmother, look at Li Wei.

228
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,520
She did something wrong,

229
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,400
but she slandered me.

230
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,540
I'm just asking for a thorough investigation with Madam He.

231
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,120
Miss Song Wu, what's the rush?

232
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,780
I knew that you would say that from what you said.

233
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,690
You've always been scheming.

234
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,640
You know my relationship with Zheng.

235
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,590
You will blame me.

236
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,140
You're quick-witted.

237
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,200
You even tricked me with words.

238
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,800
All right.

239
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,360
Since the fire didn't hurt anyone or burn anything,

240
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,900
let's put this aside.

241
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,150
Godmother...

242
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,550
But Li Wei,

243
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,380
you brought the charcoal into the palace without permission.

244
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,420
You broke the rules today.

245
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,460
I don't know what else you will do later.

246
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
I must teach you a lesson.

247
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,300
I will give you ten lashes.

248
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,390
Are you convinced?

249
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,200
Wait.

250
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,540
Today,

251
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,160
Li Wei made great contributions to the banquet in planning.

252
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,420
Merits offset faults.

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,390
In my opinion, there's no need to beat her.

254
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,540
From now on, Li Wei is grounded.

255
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,760
She can't leave the palace of Prince Zheng.

256
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,120
She is forgiven if we don't reward her.

257
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,020
No.

258
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,460
Please hit me.

259
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,290
I can be beaten.

260
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,170
Don't take away my reward.

261
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,120
I want to see my family.

262
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,720
Yin Zheng,

263
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,280
how do you discipline your wife and concubines?

264
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,680
How dare she disobey Her Ladyship's order?

265
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,970
Now that this has happened,

266
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,980
not only should she be punished,

267
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,690
but you should be punished as well.

268
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,420
This has nothing to do with him.

269
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,130
I'm sorry.

270
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,040
Your Highness,

271
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,920
how is it?

272
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,630
Li Wei.

273
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,650
You.

274
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,180
What's wrong with you?

275
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,410
You did something wrong

276
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,140
and caused him so much trouble.

277
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,250
-I am talking about you. -Come back.

278
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,190
I didn't expose you just now because I didn't want to embarrass you.

279
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,390
Don't push your luck.

280
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,770
Zheng, what did you say?

281
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,840
We grew up together.

282
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,130
You don't trust me

283
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,140
and said something so harsh to me.

284
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,680
The smell of oil on Jinping hasn't gone.

285
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,400
Li Wei is grounded.

286
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,470
You

287
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,880
think about it inside your room.

288
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,250
You...

289
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,700
Madam. Madam.

290
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,440
Why didn't you light the candles?

291
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,170
His Highness worried that you might be hungry,

292
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,770
so he ordered the kitchen to cook some noodles.

293
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,850
Why are you crying like this?

294
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,560
Madam.

295
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,780
Come on. Wipe it.

296
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,540
This...

297
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,570
-I am sorry. -I am sorry.

298
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,310
I failed to keep your reward.

299
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,850
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,380
I brought barbeque to the palace without permission.

301
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,000
But I swear it was someone else who did something to my charcoal.

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,580
I know.

303
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,440
You know?

304
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,520
Madam,

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
His Highness trusts you.

306
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,810
He even grounded Miss Song for you.

307
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Miss Song is Madam He's pearl in the eye.

308
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,180
His Highness may be scolded for it again.

309
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
That is the truth.

310
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,050
Don't listen to him.

311
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,250
You must be hungry from crying.

312
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,780
Come on.

313
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,970
Have some noodles.

314
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,620
Why are the noodles so long?

315
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,910
Longevity noodles are long.

316
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,090
Longevity noodles?

317
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,230
Whose birthday is it today?

318
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,350
Could it be...

319
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
It's His Highness's birthday.

320
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,140
His birthday is at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

321
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,270
All these years,

322
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,750
no one in Xinchuan Palace has a conscience.

323
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,060
No one remembers it.

324
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,609
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

325
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,690
I've eaten it.

326
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,680
Have some more,

327
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,680
and you will live longer.

328
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,510
I can't eat any more.

329
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,250
You have to eat it even if you are not hungry.

330
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,520
Eat the egg.

331
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,140
Shangguan.

332
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,090
Shangguan. Shangguan.

333
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,800
Look.

334
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,210
Let me show you what this is.

335
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,600
Moon cakes for you.

336
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,010
Are you trying to poison me to be a widower?

337
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,730
Don't talk nonsense during the festival.

338
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,260
Hurry up.

339
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:05,920
Try it.

340
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,250
The filling is spicy.

341
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,140
I knew you would like it.

342
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,800
I asked the kitchen to make it.

343
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,410
How is it?

344
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,460
I did a good job, didn't I?

345
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,980
But the festival in Xinchuan

346
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,160
is so boring.

347
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,060
In Danchuan,

348
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,780
we ate hot pot together and played cards.

349
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,390
We were so happy.

350
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,610
And my sister and I

351
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,550
always let the servants win

352
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,460
so that they could get more money on festivals.

353
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,200
Do all Danchuan people like

354
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,620
to play cards?

355
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,040
Yes.

356
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,600
There's a kind of card called "fight till the end".

357
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,590
We have to win the last card before we finish.

358
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,580
We also like

359
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,340
ear cleaning, fish pedicure

360
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,500
and fast mask-changing.

361
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Fast mask-changing is my favorite.

362
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,730
You like to watch fast mask-changing?

363
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,410
I thought you only liked to watch martial arts.

364
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,670
You don't understand.

365
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,880
The fast mask-changing in Danchuan is the best in plays.

366
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,250
If you can go to Danchuan someday,

367
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,910
I'll treat you to watching it.

368
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,050
Although in Danchuan, women lead the family,

369
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,740
life is very peaceful.

370
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,720
It's not as scary as you think.

371
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,900
In that case,

372
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,770
I was biased.

373
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,720
Is it delicious?

374
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,520
That's good.

375
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,380
It's good as long as you're happy.

376
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,580
No one is allowed to reveal

377
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,380
today's menu.

378
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,100
Let's move!

379
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,630
-Yes, Madam. -Yes, Madam.

380
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,140
Hold on.

381
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,950
These are new tributes from the small kitchen in the Sixth Prince's house.

382
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,410
Thank you.

383
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,860
[The Merits of Eating and Drinking]

384
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,580
What's the matter?

385
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,900
You are so mysterious.

386
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,920
I have a gift for you.

387
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,020
[Yin Zheng, happy birthday.]

388
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,110
Open it.

389
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,970
Your Highness, you're blessed.

390
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,660
I made the noodles.

391
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,050
Concubine Wei is very strong. She can drag anything.

392
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,160
Are you okay?

393
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,950
Are you okay?

394
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,830
The soup

395
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,340
was cooked by Chef Liu.

396
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,930
Hurry up.

397
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,300
My soup is almost dry.

398
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,230
Speed up.

399
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,070
The side dishes and shrimps were cooked by Brother Zhou.

400
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,150
Yuping and Yuzhan helped me make the dough.

401
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,830
I'll block it.

402
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,590
It's formed.

403
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,740
Go that way.

404
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,210
Thank you, everyone.

405
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,960
It's a pity.

406
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,450
His Highness doesn't eat shrimp.

407
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,400
I thought the seafood was fishy,

408
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,240
but this shrimp is delicious.

409
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,490
Really?

410
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,960
It's strange.

411
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,730
After I met you,

412
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,410
everything that I thought tasted bad before has become delicious.

413
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,010
Thank you.

414
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,720
By the way,

415
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,140
I have

416
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,390
a gift

417
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,800
for you too.

418
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,530
A gift for me?

419
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,000
It's not my birthday.

420
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,560
Why are you here?

421
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,880
I received your home letter.

422
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,900
I knew you missed home,

423
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,760
so we came here.

424
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,640
Home letter?

425
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,950
There is one more thing.

426
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,530
After her family receives the letter,

427
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,070
bring them to Xinchuan.

428
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,940
Your Highness, we have rules that

429
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,770
a concubine's family can't enter the palace.

430
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,410
You don't know that

431
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
before the Mid-Autumn Festival,

432
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,840
His Highness knew that you were homesick,

433
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,480
so he ordered me to break the rules

434
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,860
and send your letter.

435
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,360
Then he violated the rules

436
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,720
and brought your family to the palace to celebrate the festival with you.

437
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,120
So...

438
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,770
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law.

439
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,170
Have a seat.

440
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:05,990
Mom,

441
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
I miss you so much.

442
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,130
Serve the tea.

443
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,990
Sit here.

444
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,430
Sister,

445
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,920
you're such a troublemaker.

446
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,000
His Highness brought us to Xinchuan long ago.

447
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,360
We could have come to the palace in a grand manner.

448
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,130
But now,

449
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,340
you caused trouble in Xinchuan Palace.

450
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,000
We could only hide from others

451
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,500
in vegetable buckets

452
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,830
on a donkey cart.

453
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,740
It's so smelly.

454
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,410
It's so suffocating.

455
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,260
Are you okay?

456
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,400
I feel sorry for the vegetables.

457
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,700
Be careful.

458
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,070
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

459
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,680
I wanted to give you a surprise.

460
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,100
But later...

461
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,830
Son-in-law.

462
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,170
Call him Your Highness.

463
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,080
We're family.

464
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,410
There are no rules.

465
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,900
He married Wei.

466
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,260
Isn't he my son-in-law?

467
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,390
Yes. I am your son-in-law.

468
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,820
Should I call him brother-in-law?

469
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,460
Yes.

470
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,720
Look.

471
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,870
We're celebrating his birthday.

472
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,440
Son-in-law's birthday?

473
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,220
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

474
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,730
I have to do something.

475
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,400
Take out my red envelope.

476
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,520
Where is the red envelope?

477
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,650
Where can we find it?

478
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,000
Come on. Take it.

479
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,360
Take it.

480
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,170
No need.

481
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,310
Take it.

482
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,210
Take it.

483
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,780
It's our custom to

484
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,510
receive red envelopes in my hometown.

485
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,980
Yes. You must take it.

486
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,760
Then I will take it.

487
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,520
Thank you.

488
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,670
Wei told me that

489
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,360
you treated her very well.

490
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,670
Li and I have no other wishes.

491
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,780
We're happy that you two are good.

492
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,540
Yes.

493
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,570
When you have the chance,

494
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,130
come to Jichuan with Wei.

495
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,020
Is it right, Li?

496
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,130
Don't look down upon the countryside.

497
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,170
When you go there,

498
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,680
-I will let Li cook good food for you. -Mom.

499
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,340
We will definitely feed you well.

500
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,810
Mom.

501
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,050
Let him eat something first.

502
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,710
Yes.

503
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,970
Have some noodles.

504
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:56,300
Okay.

505
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,680
Do you know why Wei

506
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,450
is so good at making noodles?

507
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,350
Li taught her that.

508
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,760
So next time you go there,

509
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,960
ask Li to make you something delicious.

510
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,220
Thank you, Mom.

511
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,320
Your Highness, aren't you going to have dinner with Concubine Wei's family?

512
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,280
I've been thinking about it for months.

513
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,560
Am I worth nothing?

514
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,330
They are finally reunited.

515
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,080
They have a lot to say.

516
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,240
Let them have a good meal.

517
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,720
Silly girl,

518
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,170
I still think that

519
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,470
this is a dream.

520
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,900
When I wake up, I will find that you haven't been to

521
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,440
the choosing ceremony,

522
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,120
and you are still sleeping late in the small bed at home every day.

523
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,640
It's incredible that she was chosen.

524
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,290
Li Cang.

525
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,910
Wei,

526
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,250
Xinchuan has so many rules.

527
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
You must be upset.

528
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,670
I'm not with you.

529
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,510
You are alone.

530
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,460
Tell me if you feel wronged.

531
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,600
Yes.

532
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,860
I will fine you 50 pennies.

533
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,760
Li Wei is grounded.

534
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,970
She can't leave the palace of the Sixth Prince.

535
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,370
and her reward is spared.

536
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:23,920
I...

537
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,540
Did the Sixth Prince bully you?

538
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,200
Tell me.

539
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,780
I will risk my life

540
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,750
to drag Lord Xinchuan down.

541
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,760
Keep your voice down.

542
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,640
Are you making it harder for Wei?

543
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,640
If brother-in-law treats you badly, I'll beat him up.

544
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,880
Enough.

545
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,750
Mom,

546
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,090
Dad,

547
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,880
I'm doing well.

548
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,070
Is that true?

549
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,880
You can't lie to us.

550
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:10,810
It's true.

551
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,540
I made new friends here,

552
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,150
and I even conquered my colleagues.

553
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,050
I have a boss that is good to me.

554
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,730
I'm really fine.

555
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,490
Don't worry.

556
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,740
I'm doing well.

557
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,280
Fine.

558
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,590
If you say so,

559
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,850
we're relieved.

560
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:32,860
But

561
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,360
I have to tell you first.

562
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,980
If someone bullies you,

563
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,250
or you feel wronged,

564
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
you must tell us.

565
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,710
Listen.

566
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,220
Your father was right.

567
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,230
We have no other skills.

568
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,560
We'll drag the bastard down

569
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,280
even if we have to kill ourselves.

570
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,160
You blamed me.

571
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,730
Your words are scarier.

572
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,720
It's your personality.

573
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,630
Let's eat.

574
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,340
Eat it.

575
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,530
Eat more fish.

576
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,100
Fishes are nutritious and you won't get fat eating them.

577
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,530
It can't be helped.

578
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,070
Yes.

579
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,290
Your parents are here.

580
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,650
Let me do it.

581
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,690
Let me do it.

582
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,600
Let me do it.

583
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,030
It happened because of me.

584
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,870
I'm a man,

585
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,810
so I should do this kind of thing.

586
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,630
This is the first time for both of us.

587
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,420
It's the same for me, a girl, to do it.

588
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,920
Let me do it.

589
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,710
Let me do it.

590
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,720
Don't sleep on the floor.

591
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,650
You are a prince.

592
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,840
It's okay.

593
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,440
Let's sleep on the bed together.

594
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:12,080
Then neither of us needs to sleep on the floor.

595
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Let's go to sleep.

596
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,430
I'll blow out the light.

597
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,220
Just let it on.

598
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:26,940
Okay.

599
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,170
If you can't sleep,

600
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,480
we can talk.

601
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,740
Eat more, okay?

602
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,500
Put on some weight.

603
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,060
His Highness is here.

604
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,920
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law.

605
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,000
It's a small gift.

606
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,270
Please accept it.

607
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,750
Thank you so much.

608
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:51,720
Dad,

609
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,640
isn't this your favorite Yingchuan inkstone?

610
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,540
And a fan from Xinchuan.

611
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,420
Mom,

612
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,730
is the rouge from Yanchuan for you?

613
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,890
Brother-in-law,

614
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,690
you are so generous to my sister.

615
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,890
What are you doing?

616
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,020
You are such a loser.

617
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,080
Does being good to people just mean giving some worldly things?

618
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,540
You call him brother-in-law continuously.

619
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,610
He can't even let your sister be the legal wife.

620
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,360
Why don't you just call him the second brother-in-law?

621
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,220
It's OK.

622
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,960
We have no choice.

623
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,120
Xinchuan has strict rules.

624
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,680
Don't always act like you're at home.

625
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,940
It's inappropriate if you keep talking.

626
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,590
Your Highness,

627
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,920
don't be angry with him.

628
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,120
It's mainly because

629
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,280
in Jichuan, there is no concubine.

630
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,680
Her father is just feeling sorry for Wei,

631
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,040
so he talks more.

632
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,310
I understand your concerns.

633
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,100
I will take it to heart.

634
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,790
It sounds nice.

635
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,700
As the prince of Xinchuan,

636
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,860
can you let the girl from Jichuan be your legal wife?

637
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,960
Xinchuan people don't know how to appreciate her beauty.

638
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,140
Wei is so nice.

639
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,680
Girl,

640
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,120
if someone bullies you,

641
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,030
let us know.

642
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,840
I'll do my best

643
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,170
to kill Xinchuan...

644
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,160
Why are you talking so much today?

645
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,680
OK.

646
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Dad, Mom,

647
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,030
don't worry.

648
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,850
His Highness treats me well.

649
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,040
I'll take care of myself too.

650
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,620
Li Cang.

651
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,290
You are an adult now.

652
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,770
Take good care of your parents at home.

653
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,660
Got it?

654
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,320
Of course.

655
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,060
Father-in-law, mother-in-law.

656
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,240
I promise that I will do my best to treat Li Wei well.

657
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,970
Don't worry.

658
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,850
I will watch your action

659
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,870
rather than listen to your words.

660
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,510
Don't talk big

661
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,910
while doing little.

662
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,960
Yes, Father-in-law.

663
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,970
Your Highness,

664
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,760
it's getting late.

665
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,870
The palace gate is about to open.

666
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,190
We'll be in trouble if we run into officials who go to the court.

667
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,880
How about...

668
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,510
Okay.

669
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,200
We'll leave immediately.

670
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,520
OK.

671
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,470
We'll leave now.

672
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,160
Wei,

673
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,450
take good care of yourself.

674
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,550
Tell me if anything happens.

675
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,150
We are leaving.

676
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,970
Don't worry about us.

677
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,760
Let's go.

678
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,960
We will be fine.

679
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,010
Send a message to me if anything happens.

680
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

681
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,270
Take care of yourself.

682
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,360
I will be in the first bucket.

683
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,800
Send a message to me if anything happens.

684
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,180
Okay.

685
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:31,960
Let's go.

686
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,430
Li Cang,

687
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,290
say goodbye to your sister.

688
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,480
Don't worry about us.

689
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,040
Bye.

690
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,390
Bucket No. 2 needs to be covered.

691
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,580
Let's go.

692
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm leaving.

693
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,139
Next time,

694
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,929
I'll bring them here in a grand manner.

695
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,159
Princess Danchuan left because you irritated her.

696
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,830
Father, calm down.

697
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,530
I know I was wrong.

698
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,210
You just got married,

699
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,239
and she returned to her parents' home because of anger.

700
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,510
How did you do that?

701
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,210
Do you know that

702
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,260
Shangguan Jing's sister is the master of Danchuan?

703
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,290
I know.

704
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,480
I didn't mean it.

705
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,160
Enough. Don't mince your words.

706
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,840
Say it.

707
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,730
Actually, that day...

708
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,230
I have a presumptuous request.

709
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,690
I wonder if you can agree.

710
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,460
Say it.

711
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,350
Well,

712
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,810
it's like this.

713
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,440
What is it?

714
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,290
Well,

715
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,100
can you

716
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,960
agree to let me get

717
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,010
a concubine?

718
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,830
I'll have only one.

719
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,000
The two of us will live

720
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,030
and you live alone.

721
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,500
You can be happy as you want,

722
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,220
and I will never change your position.

723
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,670
OK?

724
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,530
Sure.

725
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,300
Really?

726
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,820
I was scared.

727
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,100
You answered so quickly, Shangguan.

728
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,660
You're such a good friend.

729
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,300
You have no idea that

730
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,390
Her Ladyship has found two women from Yanchuan for me.

731
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
That's really...

732
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,840
No wonder they say

733
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,240
it's the place where women are most willing to get married.

734
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,640
They are all like Hao Jia.

735
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,660
They are as gentle as water.

736
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,410
And a girl from Yingchuan is not bad either.

737
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,750
Her voice is soft.

738
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,630
Otherwise...

739
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,890
You want to have a concubine, right?

740
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,180
I...

741
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,190
Get lost now!

742
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,320
Go and take a concubine!

743
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,440
If you don't get 24 concubines, I'll break your legs.

744
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,010
This is what happened that day.

745
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,660
You unfilial son.

746
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,470
Go back to Danchuan now

747
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,540
and get Shangguan Jing back.

748
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,320
Don't go back if you can't make her happy.

749
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,840
Yes.

750
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,890
If you irritate Madam Danchuan,

751
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,520
and cause a war between two regions,

752
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,740
I will punish you.

753
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,690
I'll go now.

754
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,940
According to the order of Lord Xinchuan.

[Wenxin Hall]

756
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,240
Considering that the sixth prince has contributed to the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet,

757
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,600
and is virtuous,

758
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I order the Sixth Prince, Yin Zheng,

759
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,920
to go to Danchuan with the Fifth Prince

760
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,810
to calm down Princess Danchuan

761
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,690
so that there won't be any conflicts between the two regions.

762
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,620
Depart soon.

763
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,810
Yes, Father.

764
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,150
His Majesty also said that

765
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,090
the flood in Danchuan has been handled properly.

766
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,700
The lives of the people are back to normal.

767
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,590
You can go and check on them.

768
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,540
Yes.

769
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,310
I have another request.

770
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,630
I should have my female family accompany me to mediate.

771
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,280
Please meet His Majesty on behalf of me,

772
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,210
and ask His Majesty to stop the grounding of Ms Li from Jichuan,

773
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,410
and let her go with me.

774
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,830
His Majesty is wise.

775
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,620
He has thought of this.

776
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,040
His Majesty said that if Your Highness asked for this,

777
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,170
you were permitted.

778
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

779
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,930
I'm leaving.

780
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,570
I didn't expect the Fifth Prince would cause such trouble

781
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,570
after getting married not long ago.

782
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,590
Pack the luggage and go to Danchuan.

783
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,280

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,220
Thank you for coming with me.

786
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,150
You just got married, yet you're already thinking about taking a concubine.

787
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,120
Thinking about sex is dangerous.

788
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,310
For you, it's more than dangerous.

789
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,240
You're amazing.

790
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,650
You're good.

791
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,240
I tried to bring it up.

792
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,410
I didn't expect that one word would get myself in trouble.

793
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,140
Shangguan was just irritated.

794
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,000
She will be fine if Your Highness can talk to her.

795
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,130
Don't do this again.

796
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,120
It's hard for her to be alone in Xinchuan.

797
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,540
Yes.

798
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,090
OK. I see.

799
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,440
Come on.

00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:44,960
Then,

802
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
I'll take this as a trip.

803

Let's go to Danchuan to play cards and eat spicy food.

Danchuan is a barren place.

I thought I would travel all the way,

812
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,560
but there isn't a shop.

813
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,140
There is finally a restaurant.

00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,740
Give me "Flawless White Jade".

What?

821
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,730
It's not called "Flawless White Jade" outside.

OK.

When I was in the inner court study hall,

826
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,800
Jing taught me some Danchuan dialects.

827
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,270

Butler Su is right.

917
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,090

what the people who suffered here need,

919
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,980

my knees feel weak when I'm here.

934
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,130
I've heard that men in Danchuan are afraid of their wives.

935
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:42,330
They're proud of taking care of their wives,

936
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,400
and are ashamed of defying their wives.

937
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,720

00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,520
I feel that there is a group of Shangguan Jings here. Do you understand?

940
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,000
This...

941
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,350
This is hell.

942
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,820
I can't make it. I have to go home.

943
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,650
I have to go.

944
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:52,330
Prince Qi.

945
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:54,260
Two princes, wait a minute please.

946
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,340
Who is she?

947
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,440
I don't know.

948
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,730
I'm Head of Lady-in-Waiting in Danchuan, Situ Jin.

949
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,850
[Head of Lady-in-Waiting in Danchuan, Situ Jin]

950
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,590
I'm here to welcome you on Her Lordship's order.

951
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,370
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

952
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,600
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

953
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,100
♫A gust of wind blows♫

954
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,570
♫And stops by my ear♫

955
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,860
♫The moon shines♫

956
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,160
♫In my heart♫

957
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,730
♫Your smiles are all over♫

958
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,370
♫Gradually I am used to♫

959
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,290
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

960
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:20,000
♫I don't dare to get related♫

961
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,110
♫But you came to me♫

962
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,770
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫

963
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,470
♫I don't know what to say. I am so excited♫

964
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,270
♫But you can tell what is in my heart with your eyes♫

965
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,960
♫The road is long. Luckily, I have you♫

966
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,280
♫In rivers and mountains, let's appreciate the smoke rising♫

967
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,350
♫The past is gone with the sunrise♫

968
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:55,030
♫The warmth in your palm is in my heart♫

969
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,720
♫Let's share the light in wind, snow, and coldness♫

970
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:07,010
♫I am relieved when you are with me♫

971
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,650
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

972
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,990
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

973
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,250
♫A gust of wind blows♫

974
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,670
♫And stops by my ear♫

975
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,060
♫The moon shines♫

976
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,370
♫In my heart♫

977
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,310
♫Your smiles are all over♫

978
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,640
♫Gradually I am used to♫

979
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,460
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

980
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,510
♫I don't dare to get related♫

981
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,330
♫But you came to me♫

982
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:15,330
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫
