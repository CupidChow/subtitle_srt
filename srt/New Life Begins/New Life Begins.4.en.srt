Did bloody An get a new girl?

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,310
It's a pity that

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,390
such a cute girl will be ruined by him.

22
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,520

tricked another girl in

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,950

76
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,190

78
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,910
Tell me.

79
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,760
What's the matter?

80
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,870
Rumors are spreading outside.

81

If you still refuse to return to the palace,

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,950

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,409
happiness, and the garden

84
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,790
will be gone soon.

85
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,530
What do you mean?

86
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,270
You think I'll go back to the palace

87
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,270
after you scared me with a few words?

88
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,900
You think you can threaten me?

89
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,159
I dare not.

90
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,200
I mean

91
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,500
you don't need to keep a low profile

92
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,430
and concentrate on self-improvement.

93
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,190
Xinchuan is the head of the nine regions.

94
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,010
Although it is better than the other eight regions

95
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,000
in both military strength and political action,

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,760
only the revenue of the treasury is slightly inferior.

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,530
Now we need people.

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,630
You're a financial genius.

99
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,060
You know business well.

100
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,320

101
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,030
In fact, he's asking you to come out.

102
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,900
This is father's order.

103
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,770
Zheng.

104
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,980
You used to be quiet

105
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,520
and focus on recuperating in the palace.

106
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,720
When did you start thinking about this?

107
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,550
An,

108
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,840
although you were not born of the legal wife,

109
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,970
you were brought up by Madam Xinchuan.

110
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,610
Now that she's sick, she misses you very much.

111
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,600
Why don't you go back and take a look?

112
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
Let me think about it.

113
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,370
Today is White Dew's birthday.

114
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm going to celebrate.

115
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,640
Help yourself.

116
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,830
Give me one of these.

117
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,630
Do you like it?

118
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,380
It's so delicious.

119
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,160
Eat more if you like it.

120
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,530
Try the seafood.

121
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,880
Your dishes

122
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,540
are much better than ours.

123
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,600
We don't have enough delicious food to eat in our palace.

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
Eat more.

125
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,450
Then you have to come often.

126
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,240
Pork ribs. Have more meat.

127
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,800
Pork ribs.

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
Thank you.

129
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,610
This is also delicious.

130
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,720
Miss White Dew,

131
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,610
today is your birthday.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,450
Why do you look unhappy?

133
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,060
I really can't.

134
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,990
Today is my birthday.

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,320
That stupid An must come to my room.

136
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,050
Tell him you're in your period.

137
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,030
Stop him.

138
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,290
I used this excuse five days ago.

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,180
How about this?

140
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,920
Today is your birthday.

141
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,160
I'll go for you.

142
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,120
When it's my turn next time, you take my place.

143
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,520
He can't tell anyway.

144
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,730
No.

145
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,080
What do you mean?

146
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,640
Take the medicine if you have no other ways.

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,800
No way.

148
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,280
Medicine is bad for health.

149
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,240
You can't take it unless you have no choice.

150
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,200
Didn't I say if you have no other ways?

151
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,360
If you have no other ways, it means you have no choice.

152
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,200
Enough.

153
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,620
Don't take the medicine if you don't have to.

154
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,740
Yes, very good.

155
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,460
What are you doing?

156
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:43,180
I'll keep it for later.

157
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,650
Do you have any other good ideas?

158
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,040
So you also need it.

159
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,280
Wei.

160
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,080
Let's be friends.

161
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,050
Let me know if you need help.

162
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,040
I'll help you.

163
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,330
Thank you, Haitang.

164
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,050
Come, have some more.

165
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,720
Come to our mansion often.

166
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,230
By the way,

167
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,310
did Zheng

168
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,800
come here to take An back to the palace?

169
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,770
You all know?

170
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,950
I guessed it.

171
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,300
An has been wandering outside for so long.

172
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,950
How could the Lord let him loose?

173
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,550
Exactly.

174
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,100
In my opinion,

175
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,250
it's not a bad thing

176
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,510
if Prince An comes back to the palace.

177
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,610
First, he can return to the palace to ask for the Lord's forgiveness

178
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,330
and secure the position of young master.

179
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,130
That way, you won't be involved.

180
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,470
Second, if he goes back to the palace,

181
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,659
you won't be able to see him.

182
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,950
Yes.

183
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,159
Wei.

184
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,919
You're really thoughtful.

185
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,360
You're right.

186
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,909
Actually, I have my own motive.

187
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,890
Now I'm living in the palace of Prince Zheng.

188
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,790
He's my master.

189
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,430
So I want to do something good for him.

190
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,730
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,030
It's nothing.

192
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,720
You're right.

193
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,890
It'll be good for us if he comes back.

194
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,190
Yes, exactly.

195
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,130
Here are the noodles.

196
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,480
Smells good.

197
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,640
White Dew, come on, eat.

198
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,000
If you eat one more,

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
you will see that stupid An less.

200
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,200
I'm going to eat all of it.

201
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Okay.

202
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,230
I'm coming.

203
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,750
White Dew.

204
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,110
[White Dew]

205
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,960
Did you have a good birthday today?

206
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,150
[Frost's Descent]

207
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,820
The noodles have arrived.

208
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,620
Why is it here?

209
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,130
Here.

210
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,290
Today is your birthday.

211
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,960
Eat up.

212
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,560
The noodles won't taste good if they get soggy.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,660
Can't you see?

214
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,020
What? Dew.

215
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,790
Eat.

216
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,720
May you be blessed.

217
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Let's eat.

218
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,690
Come on, eat.

219
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,400
Eat up.

220
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Eat.

221
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,060
Come on, eat more.

222
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,960
When I saw Zheng today, he looked like a different person.

223
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,160
I have to think carefully

224
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,340
when talking to this brat.

225
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,910
Maybe it's the Lord's order

226
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,310
that makes him feel confident.

227
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,810
I think

228
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,190
it's good to go back to the palace.

229
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,610
What's so good about going back?

230
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,670
Being restrained,

231
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,440
I might get involved in Second Brother's matter.

232
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,230
Your Highness,

233
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,750
think about it.

234
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,250
The Lord asked Prince Zheng to come to you in private.

235
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,710
It means it's not serious.

236
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,490
He didn't want to make a fuss.

237
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,870
There have always been people impeaching you

238
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,500
because there are many beauties in your mansion.

239
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,510
If we ignore it,

240
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,990
if the Lord gets angry again,

241
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,520
and dismisses the sisters.

242
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,220
What should we do?

243
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,160
Yes.

244
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,320
Zheng is really thoughtful.

245
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,820
And you let Li Wei see my solar term girls.

246
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,790
This is the leverage.

247
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,350
If they report it,

248
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,410
my father will threaten me with my solar term girls.

249
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,490
They are all my precious babies.

250
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,700
Just say that

251
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,500
I picked White Dew up on the street.

252
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,120
If it weren't for me,

253
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,330
she would have died.

254
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,350
[Frost's Descent]

255
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,840
That darn An thought

256
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,740
the one who begged on the street was White Dew.

257
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,730
But it was me.

258
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,360
He said he'll be with me forever.

259
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,520
In fact,

260
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,320
it's forever with a group of people.

261
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,610
And my Grain Buds.

262
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,230
If it weren't for me,

263
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,660
her father couldn't rest in peace.

264
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,370
My father was sick and couldn't afford medicine.

265
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:49,240
[Greater Heat]

266
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,240
I wanted to exchange some money for being a maid.

267
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,560
But he insisted on saving me

268
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,960
and giving me a good life.

269
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
This is the good life.

270
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,320
Frost's Descent wanted to do business before.

271
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,620
But since ancient times,

272
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,910
how can a woman do business in public?

273
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,690
I can't let her suffer anymore.

274
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,080
Why?

275
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,120
[White Dew]

276
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,680
I wanted to

277
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,280
do something big at the time.

278
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,280
He came as soon as I started.

279
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
I thought he wanted to buy goods.

280
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,720
But he wanted me to...

281
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,300
Greater Heat was also a poor girl.

282
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,920
When I met her,

283
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,480
she didn't even have a pair of shoes.

284
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,280
Who didn't have shoes?

285
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:26,100
[Grain Buds]

286
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,610
I was dancing barefeet and making money.

287
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,950
But he took me home.

288
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,630
If he didn't give me too much,

289
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,630
I wouldn't agree.

290
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,700
To make them comfortable,

291
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,310
I didn't register for them.

292
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,890
But now someone wants to use them against me

293
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,760
and kick them out.

294
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,970
I will never agree.

295
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,990
In that case,

296
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,260
why not take the chance of the morning court

297
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,460
to go back naturally,

298
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,310
talk to the Lord

299
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
and protect the sisters?

300
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,410
Okay.

301
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,210
Let's go back together tomorrow.

302
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,190
Are you crazy?

303
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,550
No, I mean...

304
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,520
The girls are not registered.

305
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,530
How can they go back?

306
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm going back to the palace for a while.

307
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,450
I really want to take all of you back.

308
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,920
But I have no choice.

309
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,070
According to the rules,

310
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,080
a young master can only bring four maids.

311
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,540
The one who didn't come back with me this time...

312
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,520
I know

313
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,050
you all will miss me.

314
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,860
Life will be hard.

315
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,560
You all need me so much.

316
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,100
I have to treat you equally.

317
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,110
To be fair,

318
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,770
I've decided.

319
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,880
Let's hold

320
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,030
a solar terms selection.

321
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,860
Give me some coins.

322
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,810
It's all here.

323
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,440
Let go.

324
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,650
You...

325
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,200
You dropped it too.

326
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,780
You...

327
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,700
You five are eliminated.

328
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,600
Little slim waist.

329
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,410
Cherry mouth.

330
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,740
The demands for beautiful women

331
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,190
are just so cruel and harsh.

332
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,000
You are already top quality.

333
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,570
But on the way to improve,

334
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,620
we need to go forward

335
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,170
and create more glory.

336
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,340
Inkstone.

337
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:43,990
Paper.

338
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,700
You've gained weight.

339
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,440
You should learn from her.

340
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,460
Good.

341
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,290
You've gained weight.

342
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,180
Why is it still so thick while holding your breath?

343
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,480
You know your place.

344
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,270
Why have you all gained weight?

345
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,580
But it doesn't matter.

346
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,380
After I leave,

347
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,570
you'll lose weight

348
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,920
after eating vegetables for a month.

349
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,540
Come on.

350
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,070
You're the only one left.

351
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,470
You are the last hope.

352
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,710
Almost there.

353
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,980
Hang in there.

354
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,030
Arm.

355
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,970
Go back.

356
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,770
None of you

357
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,200
passed the selection.

358
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,140
Forget it.

359
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,940
How about this?

360
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,520
White Dew.

361
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,690
Frost's Descent.

362
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,040
Greater Heat.

363
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,720
Grain Buds.

364
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,450
The four of you will come with me to the palace.

365
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,140
Which four?

366
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,820
You'll pay for it sooner or later.

367
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,630
Are you full?

368
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,500
I'm full at An's place.

369
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,220
Thank you for your help today.

370
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,820
Thank you.

371
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,890
You're welcome.

372
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,220
I told you that

373
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,690
I eat your food and wear your clothes.

374
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,480
I should do something for you.

375
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,830
I should do something for you.

376
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,880
But their situations

377
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,190
are different from what I thought.

378
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,290
Different?

379
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
You're so clever.

380
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,560
An has decided to return to the palace.

381
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,760
He will attend the court tomorrow morning.

382
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,890
But besides Lady Haitang, he will also bring four maids.

383
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,310
Four?

384
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,460
Then did I get them in trouble?

385
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,120
I'm full.

386
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,140
See you.

387
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,130
Wait.

388
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,930
Song Wu.

389
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,280
You sleep in the guest room.

390
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,240
I'll go to your place tonight.

391
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,280
-You... -I have it.

392
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,170
What?

393
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,210
I have my period.

394
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,260
Period?

395
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,490
Drink more hot water.

396
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,440
I'm here to ask.

397
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,760
What did you and Lady Haitang say

398
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
that made An change his mind?

399
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,540
Girls should understand each other.

400
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,400
We should help each other.

401
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,020
But I didn't expect him to bring some maids.

402
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,790
I'm afraid they'll get in trouble.

403
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,770
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

404
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,080
Don't worry.

405
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,730
I won't force you to consummate with me.

406
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,060
Sit.

407
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,040
You should have told me earlier.

408
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,570
I've been worried for days.

409
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,800
I have a favor to ask you.

410
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,100
I'm almost 20 years old.

411
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,200
I need to work in the imperial court as soon as possible.

412
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,260
I need to establish an image of a family man

413
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,530
in front of father.

414
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
My brothers and I

415
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
are different from common people.

416
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,030
Although we are brothers, our relationships are complicated.

417
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,660
Please help me mediate in the inner court.

418
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,460
Don't worry, there's no problem.

419
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,900
I'll work for you from now on.

420
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,350
You are my master.

421
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,470
Master?

422
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,760
It's just an example.

423
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,100
That's all.

424
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,810
There is no need to see me off.

425
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,470
Your Highness,

426
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,250
I have an idea

427
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,320
about what you said last night.

428
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,560
You are about to turn 20.

429
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,480
You need to enter the court as soon as possible.

430
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:27,840
Yes.

431
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,270
I have a favor to ask.

432
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,690
If I do well in the inner court study hall,

433
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,990
after you enter the court,

434
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,260
can I...

435
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
You want to leave?

436
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,460
You're so wise.

437
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,140
That's what I thought.

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,130
If you want to leave,

439
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,560
I won't force you to stay.

440
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,910
After I enter the court,

441
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
I'll try to ask father's permission

442
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,040
to send you home.

443
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

444
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,480
One more thing.

445
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,600
If I get divorced for other reasons,

446
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,440
it will give me a bad reputation.

447
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,680
It'll be hard for me to explain when I go home.

448
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,070
Divorce for not having any children.

449
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,310
What do you think?

450
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,030
Sure.

451
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
It's all up to you.

452
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,000
Your Highness, you are such a kind person.

453
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,310
My family is poor.

454
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,400
I'm immature.

455
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,680
I don't deserve you.

456
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,640
You can divorce me and marry a better one.

457
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,430
Aren't you tired of eating these?

458
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,360
There is a restaurant in Xinchuan that sells very delicious crispy roast ducks.

459
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,820
It's tender on the inside.

460
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,520
If you eat it with cucumber strips and shredded onions...

461
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,580
I don't eat onions,

462
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,500
nor ducks.

463
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,760
What about mutton soup?

464
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,250
How about mutton soup?

465
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,000
The mutton soup won't taste strong with pepper.

466
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,060
I don't eat mutton.

467
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,560
Pork?

468
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,760
You eat pork, right?

469
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,660
Stewed Pork Balls in Brown Sauce

470
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,280
with Shrimp and Crabmeat.

471
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,520
Put them in the hot pot with oil.

472
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,640
You can't imagine how good it tastes.

473
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,040
I don't like greasy food.

474
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,250
Sweet and sour ribs?

475
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,450
No, I don't eat sweet and sour things.

476
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,480
Then tell me

477
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,170
what else you don't eat.

478
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,280
Nothing.

479
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,690
Anything is fine.

480
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,310
Good.

481
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,450
These are healthy.

482
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,370
Since they're healthy,

483
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,560
eat all of them.

484
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,990
Don't make waste.

485
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,640
You're not cold fungus.

486
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,430
You are a little sea cucumber.

487
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,280
You're cold fungus.

488
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,440
A lady of integrity

489
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,430
should nurse her temperament,

490
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,630
administer her mind,

491
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,250
and uphold ethics.

492
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,360
Therefore, she can have a gentleman to match and teach her.

493
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,470
Don't do anything indecent.

494
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,400
Don't follow...

495
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,820
Lady,

496
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,030
please answer

497
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,660
what do the words I just read mean.

498
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,280
A lady of integrity...

499
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,240
Louder!

500
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,410
I can't hear you.

501
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,930
Should nurse her temperament...

502
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,080
I told you to speak up. Don't you understand?

503
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,290
You scared her.

504
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,660
Who are you trying to scare with a ruler?

505
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,800
How dare you lecture me?

506
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,930
Tell me

507
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,770
what I meant just now.

508
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,030
I meant

509
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,810
women should follow rules.

510
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,930
I think you are a typical bad example.

511
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,320
You always bring a stupid spear.

512
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,200
You're not serious.

513
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,600
You don't look like a girl.

514
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,230
Only you know what women should be like.

515
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,430
You know everything.

516
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,320
Do you think you can teach others

517
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,090
how to be women by scaring them with a ruler?

518
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,800
I'll see the world with my spear

519
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
and stabilize the country.

520
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,720
What's wrong?

521
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,800
That's not what a woman should do?

522
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,200
You...

523
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,840
Don't leave after school.

524
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,120
Copy the inner training ten times.

525
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,170
I won't.

526
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,040
You...

527
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,640
Your... Your Highness.

528
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,350
Don't quarrel with Nanny because of me.

529
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,560
Nanny.

530
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,710
I'll copy for you.

531
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,340
You two

532
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,030
can't leave until you finish copying today.

533
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,070
Don't worry.

534
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,030
I have an idea.

535
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,430
Amazing!

536
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,600
You're awesome.

537
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,360
Copying by two

538
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,320
is the same as copying by just me.

539
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,060
Princess,

540
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,020
thank you for earlier.

541
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,890
We all think you're handsome.

542
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,530
No need to thank me.

543
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,010
Just call me Shangguan.

544
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,680
Don't be afraid of them anymore.

545
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,670
I'll protect you.

546
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,170
And you.

547
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,580
Actually, I'm not afraid.

548
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,720
I was born slow.

549
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,630
I talk and do things slowly.

550
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,110
I can't keep up with others.

551
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,460
Wait.

552
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,570
I have a question.

553
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,940
Do you feel fast when you look at us?

554
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,550
Yes.

555
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,570
Do you feel fast when you look at us?

556
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,340
Stop it.

557
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,400
You scared the kid.

558
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,380
Maybe it's really fast.

559
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,130
Stop it.

560
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,460
I'm curious.

561
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,620
So, is it fast or not?

562
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,000
Do you feel dizzy?

563
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Is it fast?

564
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,520
A little.

565
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,310
You have inner beauty.

566
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,870
You're eloquent,

567
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,120
but ordinary people are not as capable as you.

568
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,870
In our hometown,

569
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,990

Speaking of white gourds,

everyone thinks it should be made savory.

572
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,950
We should make stir-fried white gourds

573

or white gourd rib soup.

574

Your Highness,

759
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,449
these are the latest preserved egg and spinach noodles I made.

760
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,840
Please have a taste.

761
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,120
I remember I said I don't eat spinach.

762
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
It tastes bitter.

763
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:23,500
I...

764
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,420
This preserved egg can change

765
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,230
the taste of spinach.

766
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:28,870
Try it.

767
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,139
I never eat preserved eggs.

768
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,409
Liu Baoquan worked very hard on this.

769
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,409
Just try it.

770
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,270
Liu Baoquan, your noodles are good.

771
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,320
Why did you suddenly improve so much on your cooking skills?

772
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,330
It's like someone else made it.

773
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,790
Don't make fun of me.

774
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,000
The dishes offered to you

775
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,570
are all made by me.

776
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,320
Is there more?

777
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,220
[Many a little makes a mickle.]

778
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,680
Courtesy requires that people's behavior should not go beyond moderation, not invade or insult others,

779
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,350
and not to appear frivolous in order to be intimate with others.

780
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,150
Cultivating the body and mind and putting them into practice

781
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,360
can be called good virtues.

782
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,580
After class,

783
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,760
please be diligent.

784
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,140
In this way, you can get your approval

785
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,030
and serve the Lord as soon as possible.

786
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Class dismissed.

787
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,440
Yes.

788
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,750
Prince Zheng, come here.

789
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:07,740
Sit.

790
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,650
You said in your article that

791
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,310
property tax can be collected by the size of land

792
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,620
instead of the number of people.

793
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,760
It's a good idea.

794
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,620
In fact, not only us,

795
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,870
Danchuan encountered flood.

796
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,270
If we can use this method,

797
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,990
it can also relieve the suffering of the refugees in Danchuan.

798
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,090
But my father never read my articles.

799
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,480
Don't worry.

800
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,070
I'll show it to the Lord myself.

801
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,850
Thank you, sir.

802
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,530
I brought sweet and sour fish, braised bamboo shoots and plum wine.

803
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,600
These are the spicy dumplings, boiled meat,

804
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,000
and blood curd I prepared.

805
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,240
I saw that you can eat spicy food,

806
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,080
so I added more for you.

807
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,760
Thank you.

808
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,300
I brought you roasted goose.

809
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,850
You are so kind.

810
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,180
I also have a good news to tell you.

811
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,060
What?

812
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,400
I, Li Wei, have successfully conquered the chef

813
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,250
and got the right

814
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,270
to order.

815
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,200
I don't need your help anymore.

816
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,270
I can bring you something nice.

817
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,580
Great!

818
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,850
Congratulations.

819
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,080
Wei.

820
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,400
Let's eat.

821
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,600
Wei.

822
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,790
Haitang.

823
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,900
Why are you here?

824
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,600
Didn't you already take these classes?

825
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Don't mention it.

826
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,920
Since Prince An entered the palace,

827
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,450
he's been at home every day.

828
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,590
We're so annoyed.

829
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,150
It's better to hide here.

830
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,530
Let me introduce.

831
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,300
This is Haitang, the wife of

832
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,000
Prince An, and her sisters.

833
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,160
This is Hao Jia, Prince Song's concubine.

834
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,290
This is Shangguan Jing, the wife of Prince Qi.

835
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,680
This is Sisi, the wife of Prince Yan.

836
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,160
We're sharing lunch.

837
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,230
Do you want to join us?

838
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,120
What a coincidence.

839
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,840
I heard that you eat vegetables all the time.

840
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,880
There is nothing delicious.

841
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,140
We've brought some food of our hometown.

842
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
You can have a taste.

843
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,880
Sure.

844
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,930
Come, sit.

845
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,530
Your dishes are so delicious.

846
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,650
Let me show you what we brought.

847
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,750
This is the specialty of Jinchuan.

848
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,410
Tender Boiled Chicken.

849
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,440
So white.

850
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,560
I'm from Mochuan.

851
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,150
My people love hand-cut mutton the most.

852
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,640
Smells good.

853
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,280
This is Daichuan's smelly mandarin fish.

854
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,640
It does smell a bit.

855
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,640
Cangchuan has short summers and long winters. It's dry and without much rain.

856
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,680
There is nothing delicious.

857
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,360
I just made some pickles.

858
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,960
Have a taste.

859
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,700
OK.

860
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,080
This is the comprehensive food feast of the nine regions.

861
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,320
It's so delicious.

862
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,410
Let's eat.

863
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,040
Let's eat.

864
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,760
Let's eat.

865
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,700
Smells so good. Let's eat.

866
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,090
By the way,

867
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,710
the Ministry of Rites told me

868
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,570
that virtues of ladies and concubines will be reviewed

869
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,640
by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

870
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,900
Concubine Wei's reputation has always been bad.

871
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,250
If the Lord blames for not managing the family well,

872
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,700
your reputation will be ruined.

873
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,220
Stand up!

874
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,050
No talking when eating or sleeping.

875
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,490
If I find you making jokes while eating again,

876
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,460
you will be caned.

877
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,200
Who is this Nanny?

878
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,390
I'm your official teaching Nanny.

879
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,120
My surname is Yan.

880
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,010
The previous Nannies

881
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,340
were too lenient to you.

882
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,150
From now on,

883
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,140
you must behave yourselves

884
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,390
in front of me.

885
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,290
You must set examples

886
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,540
for girls in the world.

887
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,490
As the saying goes,

888
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,630
if you can control a man's mouth,

889
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,580
then you can control his legs.

890
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,710
Rough words make sense.

891
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,240
You must practice hard

892
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,690
so that you can be good cooks.

893
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,180
Princess.

894
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,910
Your cooking

895
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,680
makes the heaven angry and people complain.

896
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,270
If a Xinchuan girl made such a dish,

897
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,060
she would have been abandoned 80 times.

898
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,240
You are not so much pushing your husband out

899
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,070
as sending him to hell.

900
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,370
Say it again?

901
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,970
Princess,

902
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,510
you can bully men in Danchuan

903
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,060
and ask them to marry into the palace.

904
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,720
But this is not your hometown.

905
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,460
No one is your mother.

906
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,990
No one will spoil you.

907
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,530
Nanny,

908
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,800
come and take a look at the dishes.

909
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,320
The color doesn't seem right.

910
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,560
Yes.

911
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,240
This one is too light.

912
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,360
I don't know what to add.

913
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,160
Please help us.

914
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,180
Yes, Nanny.

915
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,410
Please take a look.

916
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,720
You're all protecting her, aren't you?

917
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,450
You treasure sisterhood.

918
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,550
In Xinchuan, the masters are men.

919
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,080
If you don't understand the principles in the inner court,

920
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,070
you don't even deserve to be servants or maids.

921
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,380
Nanny.

922
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,310
You may have gone a little too far.

923
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,470
Not only did you insult the princess,

924
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,270
but you also insulted servants.

925
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,210
People who work for money have dignities too.

926
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,400
We can't simply bully them.

927
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,400
Besides,

928
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,300
people who don't know how to cook can just learn.

929
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,160
You are a nanny.

930
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,470
You should teach and enlighten others

931
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,800
instead of oppressing them.

932
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,710
You talked back to me.

933
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,700
I am being reasonable.

934
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,310
Shut up!

935
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,950
You're a mistress from Jichuan.

936
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,340
How dare you talk back to me?

937
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,160
Hao Jia.

938
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:36,270
You're protecting her, aren't you?

939
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,140
♫The weather is cool, the clouds are light♫

940
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,360
♫Flowing waters greet people♫

941
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,400
♫In the breeze♫

942
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,190
♫Your gentle smile♫

943
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,570
♫It is remembered in my heart♫

944
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:31,350
♫The red cherry blossoms fall with the wind♫

945
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:37,710
♫Weapons run out, time passes♫

946
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,980
♫Everything goes with the wind♫

947
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,630
♫As I remember you♫

948
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:49,310
♫I will have a nice day♫

949
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:54,490
♫My life is related with you♫

950
00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:00,080
♫The chance meeting made me fall in love at first sight♫

951
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,230
♫So many rains and winds♫

952
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,730
♫Wet the footprints♫

953
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:11,470
♫You're the reason I'm here♫

954
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:16,920
♫Mountains and rivers stretch for thousands of miles because of you♫

955
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:22,580
♫We enjoy at the grassy grass at the pavilion♫

956
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,250
♫My love♫

957
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,420
♫Won't change♫

958
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:36,670
♫No matter the ends of the earth, I will wait for you♫

959
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,870
♫The red cherry blossoms fall with the wind♫

960
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:06,570
♫Weapons run out, time passes♫

961
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,130
♫Everything goes with the wind♫

962
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,970
♫As I remember you♫

963
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:18,650
♫I will have a nice day♫

964
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,530
♫I'll give you the rest of my life  and we'll be together♫

965
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:29,410
♫We have fallen in love with each other as time goes♫

966
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,750
♫So many rains and winds♫

967
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,200
♫Wet the footprints♫
