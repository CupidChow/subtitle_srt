Not many.

10

The chefs in the headquarters are already practiced now.

They won't make mistakes and have gotten familiar with the process.

12

They can be appointed to manage the new branches.

13
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,840
New chefs can be hired into the headquarters,

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,040

and go to the Huaiping Town by way of the Zhongzhou County.

115

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,180
Braised seafood of Jinchuan.

192
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,100
Sweet and sour ribs of Yingchuan.

193
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,790
Fried eggplant box of Mochuan.

194
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,190
Stinky tofu of Daichuan.

195
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,560
Rolled pancakes of Cangchuan.

196
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,080
Jichuan's rice noodles with mushroom.

197
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,030
And cherry cheese of Yanchuan.

198
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,930
Amazing!

199
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,850
Amazing!

200
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,090
Smells good.

201
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,480
Here.

202
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,020
Thank you, Chef Xiao.

203
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,190
Please have a taste.

204
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,960
I shall cut the polite remarks then.

205
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
I'll start first.

206
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,360
Smells good.

207
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,400
It's so delicious.

208
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,650
This is delicious too.

209
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,870
This is too crispy.

210
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
This is so tender.

211
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,450
This is the supposed taste.

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,480
Cangchuan is always said to be "the desert of food",

213
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,310
having only pancakes for getting everything rolled in.

214
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,620
I don't think so.

215
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,370
Pancakes can be easily made, easily fill us up,

216
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,880
and also be served together with various kinds of meat and sauce.

217
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,630
As long as it's cooked in the right way,

218
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,690
it won't taste bad.

219
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,150
Well said.

220
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,130
Your cooking

221
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,760
tastes the same as my father's.

222
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,360
By the way,

223
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,400
I haven't introduced him yet.

224
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,540
This is Xiao Yang.

225
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,950
He's also from Jichuan.

226
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,260
-You're also from Jichuan? -Yes.

227
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,930
No wonder you can make so authentic dishes.

228
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,510
Come on.

229
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,350
Sit down and eat together with us.

230
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,110
Don't feel ill at ease.

231
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,730
Sit down.

232
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,960
I've been away from home for a long time.

233
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,360
I always want to eat this.

234
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,480
But there are just a few kinds of mushrooms

235
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,210
in Xinchuan.

236
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,270
Please make do with it.

237
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,320
It's true.

238
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,800
It's really hard to find delicious mushrooms here.

239
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,360
There occasionally are some in the market.

240
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,950
But those are far worse than the ones in our hometown.

241
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,270
Yes.

242
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,160
A few days ago, I wanted to make dry-fried grifola frondosa for Prince Han.

243
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,220
I went all over Xinchuan,

244
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,880
but couldn't find the material needed.

245
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,040
Prince Han, you like eating grifola frondosa?

246
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,550
My parents brought some to me before.

247
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,240
Come to my mansion to get some when you have time.

248
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,570
Okay.

249
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,700
Thank you so much.

250
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,440
You're welcome.

251
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,570
Since you're Prince Han's friend,

252
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,750
then we should also see you as a good friend.

253
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,470
Eat.

254
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,540
Have some more.

255
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,280
[Changle Rouge]

256
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,110
Thank you.

257
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,410
I'll buy the rest.

258
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,500
Can you pack up the stall early?

259
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,350
Let me do it.

260
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,050
You used to do such things.

261
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,610
You still like this tea.

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,470
Why should I change my taste

263
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,450
because of a bad man?

264
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,130
Besides,

265
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,510
he doesn't deserve to make me feel traumatized.

266
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,360
By the way,

267
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,010
I'm here to tell you

268
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,930
I'm going back to Daichuan.

269
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,840
If you don't mind,

270
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,460
Women's Chamber of Commerce welcomes you.

271
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,490
You have experience and intelligence.

272
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,350
It's not that I have nowhere to go.

273
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,360
It's just that I have to go back.

274
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,410
My family

275
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,580
needs me to manage the mines.

276
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,980
Why should I stay in Xinchuan where I'm not familiar with?

277
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,440
Right?

278
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,980
Sorry for offending you.

279
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,810
But there are so many mines at home.

280
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,610
Are you to deal with them alone?

281
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,540
You don't have any other siblings?

282
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,120
Maybe

283
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,900
you only saw me trapped in the mansion.

284
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,270
But you don't know what I was like

285
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,600
when young.

286
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,570
Although I don't have any sisters,

287
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,250
I have a few brothers at home.

288
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,580
This time, after I go back,

289
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,720
if they know

290
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,660
men and women should get equal shares of the family assets,

291
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,940
then that will be good.

292
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,680
If they think only men

293
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,180
should inherit everything in the family,

294
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,080
then I'm afraid

295
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,640
that I must let them

296
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,980
understand this.

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,570
Fangru.

298
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,390
Take care.

299
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,690
Coming.

300
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,740
Go.

301
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,520
Here.

302
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,850
Here are so many kinds of mushrooms, Your Ladyship!

303
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,700
The enoki mushrooms are so good-looking.

304
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,500
I'll cut some.

305
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,280
The knife is blunt.

306
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,000
You should grind it.

307
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,320
Though the enoki mushrooms are from Jichuan,

308
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
according to the custom in Danchuan,

309
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,820
it'll taste better with spicy oil.

310
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,700
This...

311
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,940
My master told me

312
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,840
we should take the chilies out to dry them.

313
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,660
To dry the chilies at night?

314
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,280
Yes.

315
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,380
To dry them under the moonlight.

316
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,970
Yes.

317
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,720
To gather the essence of the sun and the moon.

318
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,640
Forget about the kitchen knife.

319
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,570
The chilies are from my own garden.

320
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,380
What you two are doing

321
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
is not the right way to treat guests.

322
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,560
You have your own garden.

323
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,900
Can you show me around?

324
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,250
Sure, I'll show you.

325
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:45,580
Okay.

326
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,810
Let's go.

327
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,590
This kitchen is my place.

328
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,600
No one is allowed to go in and out freely.

329
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,780
Quan.

330
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,920
I'm sure he's not a good person.

331
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,790
We should be more vigilant.

332
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:07,900
Yes.

333
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,600
Your Highness.

334
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,410
I heard that Prince Jun

335
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,320
treats the people in the palace very well.

336
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,740
He bought others a lot of things.

337
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,840
Why don't we also do so?

338
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,860
This is Jun's way of doing things.

339
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,580
Let's just mind what's within our duties.

340
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,590
Of course, we should.

341
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,130
-The vegetables in the garden... -But sometimes...

342
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,480
are all grown by ourselves.

343
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,590
You can pick some and take them back

344
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,630
to Prince Han.

345
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,210
Then he'll definitely be very happy

346
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,810
when seeing the vegetables.

347
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,760
I didn't expect there's such a big piece of land in your mansion

348
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,720
for growing vegetables.

349
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,430
And you are good at selecting vegetables.

350
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,280
Xinchuan is cool in summer and warm in winter.

351
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,140
It's perfect for planting these.

352
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,740
If some wolfberries can also be grown currently,

353
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,880
then that's even better.

354
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
That makes sense.

355
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,180
I'll buy some wolfberry seeds tomorrow.

356
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,920
Not many people in Xinchuan know how to plant vegetables.

357
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,050
Jichuan is the best.

358
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,290
You're back.

359
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,990
Who is this?

360
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,000
This is the new chef of our restaurant,

361
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,600
Xiao Yang.

362
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,010
Coincidentally,

363
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,340
he's also from Jichuan.

364
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,660
Greetings, Prince Zheng.

365
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,260
Chef Xiao cooks really good dishes,

366
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,500
especially the Jichuan cuisine.

367
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,090
He cooks the most authentic Jichuan dishes I've ever eaten in Xinchuan.

368
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,120
It's a rare chance to meet someone from your hometown.

369
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,850
That's good.

370
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,280
I heard you're going to plant wolfberries.

371
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,680
But...

372
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,910
Isn't it here?

373
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,710
Yes.

374
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,580
Right.

375
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,670
-That's capsicum frutescens. -That's capsicum frutescens.

376
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,740
It's not fully grown,

377
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,520
and indeed looks similar to wolfberries now.

378
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
It doesn't matter if you can't tell.

379
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,560
You're not like Xiao Yang.

380
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,350
Your daily work's not related to vegetables.

381
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,480
It's not your fault.

382
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,710
Yes, Your Highness.

383
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,210
He...

384
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,270
I shall take leave.

385
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,460
I got business to do.

386
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,190
You know what you should do, right?

387
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,260
That's a chili.

388
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,980
Chili?

389
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,680
I didn't expect the Sixth Prince

390
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,080
to be quite interesting.

391
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,420
Lovely.

392
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,740
Let's continue our visit here?

393
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,540
I have a few more questions for you.

394
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,910
The vegetables withered a few days ago.

395
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,260
Do you know what's the problem?

396
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,319
Is it because I watered them too much?

397
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Yes.

398
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,390
It's a bit over-watered.

399
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,810
But...

400
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,530
That cabbage looks good.

401
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,400
This cabbage

402
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,910
was bitten a lot by Baifu a few days ago.

403
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,610
Jun treated a lot of people

404
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,170
in the Ministry of Revenue.

405
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,330
I've checked it.

406
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,880
Nothing went wrong.

407
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,890
It was just for rewarding them.

408
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,000
But I've been worried

409
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,010
if he has other intentions.

410
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,130
If he really wants to do something,

411
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,330
it's normal to draw someone to his side.

412
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,820
Let's wait and see.

413
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,810
He also recommended many proteges to all offices,

414
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,210
except the Nine Regions Affairs Division which is strictly managed by you.

415
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,450
Many in the court are his men now.

416
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,540
That Prince Song put him in the Ministry of Rites

417
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,750
was also for winning over the scholars.

418
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,380
But he did a good job in that.

419
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,480
But as long as they are loyal to the court,

420
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,680
it doesn't matter who they're backing.

421
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,180
Fine.

422
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
You're generous.

423
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
I listened to you and checked his account.

424
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,260
Although he has been bribing others here and there,

425
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,040
he never embezzled public funds.

426
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,290
His wife also treats him very well.

427
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,220
She even used her dowry to help him.

428
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,300
Try it.

429
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,210
It's really good.

430
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:32,820
I like it.

431
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,850
I'm glad you like it.

432
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,780
Please eat more.

433
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,780
Okay.

434
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,200
Not bad.

435
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,230
Do you want some more tea?

436
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Thanks for your hard work.

437
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,520
Thanks for your hard work.

438
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,120
Thank you.

439
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,230
Why are you still blowing it?

440
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,740
The tea cup's almost empty.

441
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,480
I was to tell you

442
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,890
you were acting strange today.

443
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,520
There's a room, but you refused to go in.

444
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,030
Must we stand here and talk?

445
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,790
I am...

446
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,250
Are you satisfied with the dishes?

447
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,850
These dishes are delicious.

448
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,230
Did you make them?

449
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,200
Yes.

450
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,270
I'm glad you are satisfied.

451
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,100
You are not only good at cooking,

452
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,090
but also have a good personality.

453
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,020
Are you married?

454
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,380
Not yet.

455
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,690
Please enjoy it.

456
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,930
Why are you looking at him?

457
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,730
He has a good appearance.

458
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,770
He's quite liked by the female guests.

459
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,540
He's really eloquent.

460
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
No wonder he can attract so many female guests here.

461
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,130
This must be what's called "all-rounder".

462
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,310
What's wrong?

463
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,720
I think Prince Zheng's kinda jealous.

464
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,450
Didn't you tell him

465
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,200
Xiao Yang was introduced by Prince Han?

466
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,240
They are close.

467
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
He should know it.

468
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,580
Look.

469
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,890
He's in a good mood.

470
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,970
He won't mind it.

471
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,380
He seduced my Haitang.

472
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,650
No, she's not yours anymore.

473
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,970
Don't be sarcastic.

474
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,770
Li Wei is staring at him too.

475
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,690
Who is this guy?

476
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,640
Xiao Yang. [This is also the pronunciation of "little sheep" in Chinese]

477
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,440
Little sheep?

478
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,050
I think this sheep has overstepped the line.

479
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,580
You have to discipline him.

480
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,170
Get him made into lamb soup.

481
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,680
He's the chef they hired.

482
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,080
It's none of my business.

483
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,930
I think this sheep

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,080
is more difficult to deal with than Jun.

485
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
You have to pay more attention to it.

486
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,430
Look.

487
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,850
Since I became single,

488
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Qi has also divorced.

489
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,000
It's gradually your turn.

490
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,650
Look, my grandaunt ran away, right?

491
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,070
If Li Wei also runs away,

492
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,470
it will be tragic for you.

493
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,940
I have to tell Yan

494
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,410
to keep an eye on his wife.

495
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,260
Your Highness.

496
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,920
Your Highness?

497
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,720
You're almost a wife-seeking stone.

498
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,240
Don't worry about Xiao Yang.

499
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,500
It's not that serious.

500
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,020
I didn't.

501
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,270
Really?

502
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,480
They're from the same hometown.

503
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,530
So what?

504
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,280
They have a lot to chat with each other.

505
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,610
Her Ladyship also has a lot to chat with me.

506
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,770
He can cook.

507
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,190
Liu Baoquan can cook too.

508
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,690
That's not what I meant.

509
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,990
Your Highness,

510
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,070
I mean,

511
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,810
when Her Ladyship sees you,

512
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,870
she looks so happy,

513
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,560
even smiling with two dimples.

514
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,420
I didn't see her do this to others.

515
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,260
Right?

516
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,760
Besides,

517
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,260
our Prince Zheng

518
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,000
is so handsome and lovable.

519
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,880
Who would leave you to see others?

520
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,310
Right?

521
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,440
Be generous.

522
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,360
Smile.

523
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,260
Yes, like me.

524
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,070
Yes, smile.

525
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,600
Yes.

526
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,310
Prince Zheng.

527
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,920
Xiao Yang will go back with us tonight.

528
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,590
He developed some new dishes.

529
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,120
He wants you to have a taste.

530
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,650
Let's go.

531
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,440
[Food-serving Room]

532
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,340
Chef Xiao,

533
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
I've always wanted to learn cooking from you.

534
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,490
Can you teach me?

535
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,380
Of course.

536
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,970
So...

537
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,060
Where are the cooking utensils?

538
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,520
Oh, yes,

539
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,350
where are the cooking utensils?

540
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,230
Chef Liu.

541
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,160
Where are the cooking utensils?

542
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,640
Yes.

543
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,730
Where are the cooking utensils?

544
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,200
Why is everything missing as long as Chef Xiao comes?

545
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,210
Yes.

546
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,090
Chef Liu,

547
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,750
it's not easy for Xiao Yang to come here and cook.

548
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,770
Don't make it difficult for him.

549
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,120
This is

550
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,680
the mansion of Prince Zheng and Concubine Wei.

551
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,060
We have no obligation to be friendly to an outsider.

552
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,070
Yes.

553
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,860
It's okay.

554
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,560
Chefs always treat the kitchen as their territory.

555
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,720
It's inappropriate for me to step in rashly.

556
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,490
No.

557
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,320
So,

558
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,020
I didn't come empty-handed.

559
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,170
Chef Liu,

560
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,420
you've been working hard.

561
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,740
I prepared a gift for you.

562
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,690
How did he hide the knife in his clothes?

563
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,020
It's the skill of the Jichuan people.

564
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
What kind of knife is this?

565
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,290
Isn't this

566
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,240
specially used by the famous family of chefs, the Xiao family?

567
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,840
Descendant of the Xiao family,

568
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,860
please accept my bow.

569
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,210
Chef Liu, please get up.

570
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,710
This pair is for you.

571
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,940
Thank you.

572
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,870
I made this pomade myself.

573
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,650
It's good for your hair.

574
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,770
No, this is...

575
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,280
I made this bag of pastry myself.

576
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,350
Thank you.

577
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,450
Butler Su.

578
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,240
Great scheme, Chef Xiao.

579
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,450
You are here to bribe people?

580
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,220
How could I?

581
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,520
I just want to cook some stomach-soothing dishes

582
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
for Prince Zheng.

583
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,180
Really?

584
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,270
So, Butler Su...

585
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,830
Don't bother.

586
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,490
I'll find it myself.

587
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,180
So Butler Su, I didn't prepare any gift for you.

588
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,310
Stop looking for it.

589
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,610
I don't need it.

590
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,370
Listen to me.

591
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,220
That's because I heard from Prince Han...

592
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,800
What did he say?

593
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,200
You value Prince Zheng more than yourself.

594
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,320
Of course.

595
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,030
If I can help you

596
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,630
nurse Prince Zheng,

597
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,640
it can be more important than giving you a gift.

598
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,240
Am I right?

599
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,940
Yes.

600
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,710
You know?

601
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,910
I'm most worried about His Highness' stomach disease...

602
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,580
I don't need it!

603
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,710
Our Prince Zheng is in good health.

604
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,920
With Her Ladyship's good care,

605
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,890
he eats a lot and is very strong!

606
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,400
Do I still need to cook the stomach-soothing dishes?

607
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,430
Just write down the recipe.

608
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,570
Chef Liu, check his cooking skill.

609
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,540
Who wants your gift?

610
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,060
Chef Liu.

611
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,360
Where are the cooking utensils?

612
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,900
Let me get them out.

613
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,700
It's all here.

614
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:35,720
Come on.

615
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,700
Be careful.

616
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
They are all here.

617
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,120
It smells so good, Chef Xiao.

618
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,600
Yes.

619
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,730
These are all my favorite dishes, Chef Xiao.

620
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,770
You're amazing.

621
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,240
I really like the dishes you cook.

622
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,040
It looks healthy and delicious.

623
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,750
Something went wrong in the kitchen,

624
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,580
so we're late.

625
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,360
Let's eat.

626
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,380
Liu Bao, Zhou Quan.

627
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,960
Didn't you say

628
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,750
you don't want others to touch your kitchen?

629
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,490
What's wrong with you guys?

630
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,830
I was indeed too narrow-minded before.

631
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,880
But now I've realized my mistake.

632
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,140
Her Ladyship rarely brings a good friend here.

633
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,000
Of course we should treat him well.

634
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,760
Yes.

635
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,330
Yuping, Yuzhan.

636
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,370
Be aware of what you should do.

637
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,110
Right.

638
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,440
We've been keeping an eye on him.

639
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,120
Good friend.

640
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,510
Yes.

641
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,260
We never took our eyes off him.

642
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
So enthusiastic.

643
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,170
Shen.

644
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,300
Don't tell me you're also…

645
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,340
I admire Chef Xiao.

646
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,450
His stomach-soothing recipe is really good.

647
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,320
The soup is made according to the recipe.

648
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,680
Let me tell you, I just took a bite.

649
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,080
My stomach is still warm.

650
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,410
Have a taste.

651
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,940
Come and eat.

652
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,260
No.

653
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,700
This...

654
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,260
Well...

655
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,840
Your Highness.

656
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,820
These dishes...

657
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,330
You have to give a fair comment

658
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,140
after you taste it.

659
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,760
Yes.

660
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,440
The comment must be very fair.

661
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,850
-Where are you going? Have some soup. -No.

662
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,330
Your Highness, please have a taste.

663
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,990
Just taste a bit.

664
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,280
Your Highness.

665
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,460
Your Ladyship.

666
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,320
His Highness...

667
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,920
I know

668
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,420
these dishes don't look good.

669
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,840
How can it be?

670
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,920
Chef Xiao has left?

671
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,680
You are obviously hungry.

672
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,480
Why didn't you eat those dishes?

673
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,630
It doesn't look good.

674
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,370
Don't let him cook anymore.

675
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,320
Your Highness has always been a picky eater.

676
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,650
I should know you won't like those dishes.

677
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,510
I just don't like the dishes cooked by Chef Xiao.

678
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,640
Why are you so angry?

679
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,140
Father asked about

680
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,180
the new currency promotion in the Nine Regions.

681
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,390
Our men are doing it.

682
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
But the connections among Jinchuan, Daichuan, Danchuan and Mochuan

683
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,570
are intricate.

684
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,000
With the promotion of the new currency,

685
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,560
it will still take some time to get profits.

686
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,970
They won't be happy with it.

687
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,040
An,

688
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,690
the tea is ready.

689
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,090
Here.

690
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,130
Have some tea.

691
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,400
Have some tea first.

692
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,720
Please have a look.

693
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,050
These are...

694
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,640
Letters from the Ministry of Revenue of Daichuan and Mochuan.

695
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,150
The negotiations with Jinchuan and Danchuan are almost done.

696
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,340
[I hereby reply you, Mochuan's Ministry of Revenue is preparing to promote paper notes, it's scheduled to be issued at the end of this month.]

697
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,440
At the end of the month,

698
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,040
they will issue paper notes in their capitals.

699
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,360
Really?

700
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,700
Thank god.

701
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,800
I've run around for it for so many times.

702
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,220
I've made great efforts to persuade them.

703
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,200
They seemed to agree with it,

704
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
but they wouldn't accept it.

705
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,600
They just passed the buck to each other.

706
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,200
Dachuan's government offices

707
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,410
have really a lot of officials.

708
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,870
So they would always do so.

709
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,020
But people always favor benefits.

710
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,570
As long as they know

711
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,110
that they will lose more if they don't take the responsibility,

712
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,400
but to step forward first

713
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,960
can help get the honor to meet their Lords face to face,

714
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,090
the problem will naturally be solved.

715
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,620
As for the other small regions,

716
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,890
you don't need to worry.

717
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,970
People in small regions

718
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,050
love bribes.

719
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,480
As long as you know one of them,

720
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,530
it will be easy to deal with the rest.

721
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,010
Some cups of liquor,

722
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,040
and some gifts

723
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,810
will solve everything.

724
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,860
You're really thoughtful, Jun.

725
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,120
You made all these by yourself?

726
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:25,630
No.

727
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,540
You flatter me.

728
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,070
With the great help of officials in our ministry,

729
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,670
and your running around

730
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,620
to pave the way,

731
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,570
I got to settle this.

732
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,410
If you're worried,

733
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,800
after I finish drafting the report, you can copy it

734
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,120
and then send it to Lord, is that okay?

735
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:44,820
I...

736
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,600
That's the deal.

737
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,110
Shouldn't you think about

738
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,730
why Father mentioned

739
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,220
levies on farmland

740
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,640
in the court today?

741
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,500
Levies?

742
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,970
Father did mention

743
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,850
that Mochuan would reduce the levies on farmland.

744
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,410
Is Father going to

745
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,450
reduce levies?

746
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,770
You are wise.

747
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,530
I guess so.

748
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,900
So I want to discuss it with you.

749
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,870
Since Father plans to do so,

750
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,860
should our Ministry of Revenue

751
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,550
get prepared in advance?

752
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,750
That's what I'm thinking.

753
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,660
Alright then,

754
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,660
if you figure out how to carry it out,

755
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,990
you can go tell Father about it personally, how do you think?

756
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,990
You're so smart, Jun.

757
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,560
Have some tea, An.

758
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,860
Brother An.

759
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,690
Sister-in-law.

760
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,740
Now there's no hostess in your mansion.

761
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,010
And it's the time

762
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,400
to offer birthday congratulations to the madams in the palace,

763
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,200
so I prepared the embroideries for you in advance.

764
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,060
You can send them to the madams one by one later.

765
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,360
Thank you for your concern.

766
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,330
Thank you.

767
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,480
Last time I told you that Jun was drawing people of the Ministry of Revenue to his side.

768
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,940
You told me not to worry and to observe first.

769
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,610
Recently, I found that

770
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,250
he's handling affairs well.

771
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,000
He's not only focusing on the Ministry of Revenue.

772
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,120
He has even established connections with other regions.

773
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,180
Jun is bold and has many connections.

774
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,270
Tasks hard for me

775
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,370
can be easily completed by him.

776
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,120
If he is really attending to his proper duties,

777
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,250
it's good for both the Ministry of Revenue and Xinchuan.

778
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,070
But I think

779
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,580
we can't let our guard off.

780
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,340
Think about it.

781
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,900
Even if he really causes trouble,

782
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,760
he will only mess with you, not me.

783
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,440
What do I mean?

784
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,870
I mean, we should continue the way we were.

785
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,360
I don't care about the things in court.

786
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,420
I'm not on anyone's side either.

787
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,460
On the surface,

788
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,960
we're just busy with our own business.

789
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,330
I didn't have lunch.

790
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,680
I was in a hurry to come to see you.

791
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,800
You haven't eaten, have you?

792
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,200
Since we are good brothers on the surface,

793
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,460
let's eat separately.

794
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,570
If others misread it, it will be not good for you.

795
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:12,900
Well,

796
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,010
are there enough sunflower seeds?

797
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,430
Butler Su.

798
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,260
You're quite pitiful.

799
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,840
There's food.

800
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:28,850
Su Shen.

801
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,490
Ask Concubine Wei to eat.

802
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,880
What's wrong?

803
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Are you wary of me?

804
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,570
You don't offer me meals, and are still wary of me?

805
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,840
No.

806
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,840
He's not an outsider.

807
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,520
Concubine Wei is not here.

808
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,450
Where did she go?

809
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,920
She went to the restaurant to see Chef Xiao.

810
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,720
She went to see the sheep?

811
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,780
Nothing.

812
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,960
It's serious.

813
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,890
This is serious.

814
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,080
We can't give him the chance.

815
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,350
Let's go.

816
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,400
Fry slowly.

817
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,590
This picky eater.

818
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,320
I worked very hard to cook the dishes.

819
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,050
He just showed no respect to it.

820
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,500
It's burnt. Ladle it out.

821
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,800
Master, try it.

822
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,679
How is it?

823
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,230
Not bad.

824
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,190
It's just a little salty.

825
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,719
You've improved a lot.

826
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,310
Good.

827
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,180
Let me tell you.

828
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,330
Losing your wife

829
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,800
can happen in a blink of an eye.

830
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,540
It's okay.

831
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,060
If you fail to do it,

832
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,650
just let others go.

833
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,300
Sister-in-law?

834
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,480
[Nine Regions Food Collection]

835
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,620
Zheng.

836
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,970
Do you think Haitang still loves me?

837
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,720
I...

838
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,430
Coming.

839
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,320
Let's eat.

840
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,230
Try it.

841
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,400
Let's... eat?

842
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,070
Eat.

843
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,340
Why is the cucumber

844
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,620
green?

845
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,880
A plate of cucumber pieces can be called a dish?

846
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,570
The cook is not good.

847
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,360
Prince Zheng,

848
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,220
don't say that.

849
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,340
If it's not green, can it be red?

850
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,940
Don't eat the tofu.

851
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,410
It's too soft.

852
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,700
It's not chewy.

853
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,730
Have you ever eaten hard tofu?

854
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,930
No, I...

855
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,920
Why does the fish still have bones?

856
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,030
Are you trying to murder my brother?

857
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,200
Enough!

858
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,210
Why are you so picky?

859
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,730
It's not just made for you.

860
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,360
Don't eat it if you don't like it.

861
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,230
If you don't need to go to court during lunch break,

862
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,030
just go home to review your official documents.

863
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,560
Looks like you're too idle,

864
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,120
keeping finding faults.

865
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
I'm here for work.

866
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,180
For work, right?

867
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:14,970
Um... yes.

868
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,610
Sister-in-law, actually he...

869
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,160
For work?

870
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,470
That's good.

871
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,290
You can go elsewhere.

872
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,630
Don't stay here.

873
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,120
Fine.

874
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,990
I'm leaving.

875
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,840
Bye, Sister-in-law.

876
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,470
If I cook for him again,

877
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,450
I'm willing to be turned into a pig.

878
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,670
Go back and explain it to him.

879
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,060
I'm just a friend introduced by Prince Han.

880
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,520
You made all these dishes.

881
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,880
As long as you make it clear,

882
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,140
he will understand it.

883
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,730
Don't waste your good time

884
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,070
on being in a sulk

885
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,570
or... cooking.

886
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,740
Shangguan.

887
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,380
The sunshine's too strong.

888
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,040
Wait for me.

889
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,560
Let me shade you from the sunshine. It's too hot.

890
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:08,890
Here.

891
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,600
Why do you keep holding this broken sunshade?

892
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,780
I might have broken it because the roads were bumpy.

893
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,380
It's okay.

894
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,860
Let me change the side.

895
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,560
What's the use of shading against the sunshine?

896
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,330
If it rains,

897
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,820
it can also shelter you from the rain, right?

898
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,560
Slow down.

899
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,300
Shangguan.

900
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,420
Shangguan.

901
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,640
I told you it would rain.

902
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,970
I'm good at predicting.

903
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,080
It's fine.

904
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,920
I brought many umbrellas this time.

905
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,200
I...

906
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,170
I've prepared a few more this time.

907
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,140
It's the sun-shower unseen in a century.

908
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,870
Come here quickly.

909
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,690
The cloak is better.

910
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,890
Luckily I was thoughtful when I went out

911
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,250
and brought some cold medicine.

912
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,780
You were caught in the rain.

913
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,130
Drink it while it's hot.

914
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,470
Drink it yourself.

915
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,380
Bitter.

916
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,450
Let me do it.

917
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,010
No, I can do it myself.

918
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,410
What?

919
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,570
Let me take care of you.

920
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,330
Let me do it.

921
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,290
Give it to me.

922
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,730
I'll take care of you.

923
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,210
Here, have some hay.

924
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,640
Why are you looking at me?

925
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,290
No, I saw you feed my horse.

926
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,090
The horse's enjoying it, right?

927
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,170
Your horse...

928
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,070
Don't look at me.

929
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,250
Well,

930
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
I'm checking the route

931
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,170
to see where we should go later.

932
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,520
Cloak!

933
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,230
Here.

934
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,100
Well...

935
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,390
This can also be a scarf for you.

936
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,750
At least it can block the wind.

937
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,290
You're right.

938
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,910
I can just drag you down.

939
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,810
I can't do anything.

940
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,310
When we get to the next town,

941
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,360
I'll leave by myself.

942
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,500
Two taels of pork belly.

943
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,400
Fifteen grams of longan.

944
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,320
Five grams of pepper.

945
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,030
And perilla, dates...

946
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,850
To get them mixed together...

947
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,710
Your Ladyship!

948
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,030
Your Ladyship!

949
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,970
Something's up.

950
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,070
His Highness is dying.

951
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:38,910
What?

952
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:40,940
Be careful.

953
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,280
♫What's the finest delicacy in the world?♫

954
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:13,420
♫Heating up a pot of tea and feeling the time pass by silently♫

955
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,890
♫Apricot flowers flowing in the stream where fish is thriving♫

♫Snow falling in winter, drunk in the spring breeze♫

960

♫Followed by poetic charm and pictorial splendor♫

961
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:44,000
♫Despite the various beautiful scenery all year round♫

962
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,610
♫The most fortunate thing is my encounter with you♫

963
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,990
♫Watching the myriad twinkling lights and dim candlelight of the city♫

964
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,760
♫One of them is waiting for me to come home♫

965
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,950
