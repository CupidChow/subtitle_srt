[Episode 10]

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,500
She said she was going to coach me with my writing.

5
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,229
It's clearly a waste of my time.

6
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,450
I'll make Su Shen

7
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,960
send some of my calligraphies to you.

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,990
Practicing calligraphy

9
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,050
does no harm to you.

10
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,110
The Nanny will give you higher marks.

11
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,870
I know.

12
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,550
If it wasn't for the first place,

13
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,080
I would never work so hard.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,840
She wants to get first place?

15
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,910
It's not that easy.

16
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,570
I'll go to Madam He.

17
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,370
Did she plant this?

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,060
Miss.

19
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,690
Don't move!

20
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Princess Shangguan.

21
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,090
I asked you to write about the virtues of women

22
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,160
based on "Biography of a Beloved Concubine".

23
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,210
You've written about their self-strongness

24
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,940
righteousness,

25
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,410
and intolerance of injustice.

26
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,320
Mrs. Li from Jichuan,

27
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
on the virtues of women,

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,829
you wrote, "Long Live the Woman".

29
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,850
Why "Long Live" the bad influence from

30
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,140
"Bibliography of a Beloved Concubine"?

31
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,750
Women have a variety of virtues.

32
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,120
Such as those who are kind and righteous,

33
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,360
and those who are chivalrous and courageous,

34
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,329
those who are considerate and delicate,

35
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,460
and those who are united and friendly.

36
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,050
Goodness is not about gender.

37
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,260
Virtue is not about sexuality.

38
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,430
We should treat them all equally.

39
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,230
At the end of the article, it also says

40
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,710
"Is it right or wrong?"

41
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,800
Yes, it's right!

42
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,500
You guys

43
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,029
did even better.

44
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,490
There is nothing on your paper.

45
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,560
You don't want to study anymore?

46
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,860
I know what you mean.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
You want Li Wei to win the first place

48
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,580
this time.

49
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,490
But the first place this time

50
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,380
doesn't belong to her.

51
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,210
It wasn't me.

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,420
I wrote nothing.

53
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,300
It was me.

54
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,440
Song Wu?

55
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,909
Nanny Yan.

56
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,560
Miss Song

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,760
volunteered to study in the inner court study hall.

58
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,450
I let her take the exam too.

59
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,380
Her essay is excellent

60
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,850
and she wins the first place.

61
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,010
Today I'll make her judge your virtues

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,030
as your example

63
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,840
and decide the rewards and punishments.

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,240
Nanny.

65
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,320
This is all my fault.

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,210
You should punish me alone.

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,020
Nanny.

68
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,640
The topic of today's paper

69
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,210
is what we think about the virtue of women.

70
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,350
Li Wei spoke her mind straight.

71
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,480
It's not off-topic.

72
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,720
What's the punishment for?

73
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,970
That's right.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,250
Hao Jia is right.

75
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,130
I'll let you know

76
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,500
the shared fate of women.

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,690
If one of you is not virtuous,

78
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
you'll drag everyone down with you.

79
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,030
Later, I will report this.

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,890
If your husbands

81
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
are reprimanded by Madam Xinchuan,

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,730
it's all your fault.

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,830
Nanny.

84
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,110
It was Li Wei and these girls' fault.

85
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,610
It has nothing to do with the princes,

86
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,270
especially not Prince Zheng.

87
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,330
Today they dare to break the rules of the exam.

88
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Tomorrow, they'd dare to shake the rules of Xinchuan.

89
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,480
They shall not be forgiven easily.

90
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,910
Nanny.

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,130
We've taken this casually.

92
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,050
We will take the rest of the exams seriously.

93
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,930
Please don't be angry, Nanny.

94
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,950
You think

95
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,520
you can just admit your mistake and be done with it?

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,460
How about this?

97
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,730
If I come out on top in all of

98
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,730
the rest of the exams,

99
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,530
would you please

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,170
not tell Madam Xinchuan

101
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,690
what happened today

102
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,970
and spare them punishment,

103
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,980
so that they can have the chance to correct themselves?

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,020
If I fail to win one of them,

105
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
I'll let you do as you please, Nanny.

106
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,030
Okay.

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I don't think you can make it anyway.

108
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,580
How are you instructed normally?

109
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,250
Your concubine has misbehaved so.

110
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
They allied to cheating

111
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
and contradicted the Nanny.

112
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm afraid they'd go further.

113
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,240
Godmother.

114
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,260
Godmother.

115
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,340
You can't blame Zheng for all this.

116
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,890
This is clearly Li Wei's fault.

117
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,750
She deserves severe punishment.

118
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,700
I think

119
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,530
you should get rid of Li Wei

120
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,400
and find a good wife for Zheng,

121
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,850
once and for all.

122
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,390
Got it.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll think about it.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You don't need to.

125
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,090
I've already decided that Li Wei is my only wife.

126
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,520
No matter how she behaves,

127
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,650
I'll take care of it.

128
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,020
Mother, don't worry about it.

129
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,440
Dear Zheng.

130
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,740
Dear Zheng.

131
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,850
Dear Zheng.

132
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,360
You didn't mean it just now, did you?

133
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,600
What did Li Wei do to you to make you say so?

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,060
Song Wu.

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,010
Mother has taken you as her goddaughter.

136
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,570
I think

137
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,300
you should call Li Wei your sister-in-law.

138
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,550
So I hope you can respect her.

139
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,180
Dear Zheng.

140
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,560
You wouldn't have treated me like this before.

141
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,420
You've changed since Li Wei came.

142
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,390
I think it's you that has changed.

143
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,060
You used to call me brother.

144
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,990
After she came, you keep calling me dear.

145
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,320
I...

146
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,480
Go back.

147
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,380
Dear Zheng.

148
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,320
It's cold.

149
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,140
You don't have to wait for me here.

150
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,179
I want to apologize to you.

151
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,159
It's all because of me

152
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,290
that you were reprimanded by Madam He.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,930
But don't worry.

154
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,470
From today onwards,

155
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,140
I'll work so hard

156
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,720
to win first place.

157
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,070
I swear.

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,970
We share joy and sorrow.

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,440
From now on, as long as I am here,

160
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,970
you don't have to be afraid.

161
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,900
You won't be angry with me?

162
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,980
I asked Liu Baoquan to make lotus seed soup.

163
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,880
Shall we eat it together?

164
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,410
Okay.

165
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,060
Song Wu asked you if you meant it.

166
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,570
What was she talking about?

167
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,140
I...

168
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,880
I don't know.

169
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,200
You mean it?

170
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:38,920
Good.

171
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,580
You got them all right.

172
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,600
It's because you've taught me well.

173
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

174
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,300
I've already had some.

175
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,800
It's okay.

176
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,700
I don't mind it.

177
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,370
It's autumn.

178
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,580
There aren't many lotus seeds left in the cellar.

179
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,040
Liu Baoquan could only make these two bowls.

180
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,440
If you just came here to read books, why would you…

181
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,880
Why would I what?

182
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,790
You

183
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,260
have makeup on?

184
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,370
Everyone wants to look better.

185
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,420
Leave me alone.

186
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
Wait a minute.

187
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,160
I'm going to Jinchuan with my brother An in a few days.

188
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,400
Be careful when you're alone.

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,130
I'll leave you with Su Shen.

If you have to say, we are all descendants of the Chinese people.

380
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,470
Jinchuan has only one rule of conduct.

381
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,200
Pay the debts.

382
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,770
A life for a life.

383
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,730
Distant grandfather.

384
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,590
Lord Jinchuan,

385
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,820
Danchuan suffered a sudden flood

386
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,940
and Xinchuan helped it out.

387
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,170
So we can't return all the money we owe.

388
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,430
But we don't mean to renege on our debt.

389
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,090
We just hope

390
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,540
you can give us some time to turn around.

391
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,720
It's none of my business if Danchuan is in trouble.

392
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,120
I just want you to pay the money back in full.

393
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,640
We're thinking about

394
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,970
repaying the debt in three installments.

395
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,780
The first installment has been delivered to Jinchuan,

396
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,790
which is 40% of the debt.

397
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,350
The second and third installments will be 30% respectively

398
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,750
with the term of one year.

399
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,230
In addition, an additional three percent interest will be offered to Jinchuan.

400
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,240
Do you think three percent of interest is enough to shake

401
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,370
our principle that debts must be paid?

402
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,260
I dare to speculate

403
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,040
the reason why you're so eager to collect the debt

404
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,900
is because you want to fill the treasury to fight the bandits, My Lord.

405
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,710
They say there are no secrets under the sun.

406
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,570
It seems Xinchuan is familiar with our activities.

407
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,950
Not really.

408
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,330
When we came to Jinchuan,

409
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,460
my brother and I encountered robbers.

410
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,980
But nothing happened.

411
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,170
We handed them over to the government,

412
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,640
where we heard that Jinchuan had the plan to eliminate the bandits.

413
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,740
But you haven't agreed on it yet.

414
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,960
I think it's because you don't have enough people and money.

415
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,450
The harmony of the nine regions brings peace

416
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,760
and a promising future for the world.

417
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,090
If we can help Danchuan,

418
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,330
we will not be an onlooker with you.

419
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,800
Xinchuan would like to send troops to help you fight the bandits.

420
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,660
As for the debt,

421
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,350
please forgive us, My Lord.

422
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,620
The flooding in Danchuan is serious.

423
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,240
I can estimate the need for relief.

424
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,430
I'm sure there is no way

425
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,250
Xinchuan can get so much money.

426
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,620
It's not easy

427
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,080
to raise the first installment.

428
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,690
I can be frank with you, My Lord.

429
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,000
The money is forced from the old accounts of the previous administration.

430
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,800
That's right.

431
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,850
Each region has its problems.

432
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,900
Well-known families always want to advance money for their merits,

433
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,100
which is the most difficult to collect.

434
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,590
But

435
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,580
I'd like to hear

436
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,660
how you managed to do it.

437
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,730
This has nothing to do with my brother.

438
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,610
It's mainly because of me.

439
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,750
Distant grandmother,

440
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,640
you know it.

441
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,380
I have Jinchuan's blood in me.

442
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,460
I couldn't stand by and do nothing about it.

443
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,610
I remember that day.

444
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,940
The sky was dark.

445
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
The sand and rocks were flying.

446
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,880
I took my brother and walked in the strong wind.

447
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,360
We went from house to house knocking on doors.

448
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,040
You can't imagine

449
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,140
how hard

450
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,430
and difficult it was.

451
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,410
My Lord.

452
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,030
The two princes of Xinchuan have been settled?

453
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,430
Yes.

454
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,220
Good.

455
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,460
I really

456
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,370
couldn't hold out any longer.

457
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,240
I was so sleepy.

458
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,380
I was so sleepy.

459
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,820
I've made some inquiries.

460
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,250
Most of the debts were collected by Prince Zheng.

461
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,210
Prince An was just helping out.

462
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,680
Prince Zheng has recently made a great achievement in Xinchuan.

463
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,610
He'll be ready for court meetings after the New Year.

464
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,460
Young and successful.

465
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,640
It seems that the situation in Xinchuan is about to change again.

466
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,100
Father.

467
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,950
Yuan Xu.

468
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,660
[Prince of Jinchuan, Yuan Xu]

469
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,660
[Madam of Jinchuan]

470
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,480
I mean.

471
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,280
You should learn from Prince Zheng of Xinchuan.

472
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,160
You're always so idle,

473
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,520
not even half as good as your elder sister.

474
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,380
That's enough.

475
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,660
Mother.

476
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,760
You see, my father always says that about me.

477
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,090
But my sister is a woman.

478
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,440
So what if she's good?

479
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,710
She still has to get married in the end.

480
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,110
How dare you be stubborn?

481
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,380
Xu is right.

482
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,900
It's time for Ying to get married.

483
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,160
My Lord, you always want to choose the best for her.

484
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,600
You even made Ying claim to be sick

485
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,010
to avoid the Selection.

486
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,000
But after all this,

487
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,880
our daughter was left behind.

488
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,340
Now it's time for her to choose the right man.

489
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,170
As Ying is getting older,

490
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,300
it'll be hard for her

491
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,220
to find a husband like this.

492
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,860
There are three long rivers in the Nine Regions,

493
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,870
which all enter the sea at Jinchuan.

494
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,610
That's why Jinchuan is so convenient in water carriage.

495
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,610
I wonder

496
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,560
how he's doing in Jinchuan.

497
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,570
Your Ladyship.

498
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,590
Your Ladyship.

499
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,000
The Prince knew you were taking the poetry test.

500
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,730
He made a special note in the book before leaving.

501
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,760
He asked me to bring it to you.

502
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,930
If Nanny Yang is to write the test,

503
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,060
this should be on it.

504
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,260
Yang followed Madam He in her early years.

505
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,460
Madam He has always liked this section.

506
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,260
Your Ladyship,

507
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,440
Prince is devoted to you.

508
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,620
It's because he wants to be allowed for court meetings.

509
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,670
Whether you win the first prize or not

510
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,700
has little to do with Prince's court meeting.

511
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,790
As long as he does a good job on the Jinchuan mission,

512
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,050
Lord Xinchuan will naturally allow him.

513
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,190
Then why did he make me

514
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,760
take the first place?

515
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,160
It's because he wants...

516
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,650
Prince won't let me talk about it.

517
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,520
But you can think about it yourself.

518
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,320
Why can't you understand?

519
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,660
Xinchuan will repay the rest of the money owed in full

520
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,980
within the agreed period.

521
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,600
I trust Xinchuan.

522
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,320
I also trust Prince Zheng.

523
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,840
Thank you, Lord Jinchuan.

524
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,760
Distant grandfather.

525
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,490
Don't worry.

526
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,260
You have me.

527
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,740
I'm half a Jinchuan person.

528
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,560
Jinchuan people are the most honest in business.

529
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,370
Prince Zheng.

530
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,840
I still have some questions for you.

531
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,030
How old are you?

532
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,750
What does this have to do with the debt?

533
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,900
It has nothing to do with the debt.

534
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,840
I just want to know more about you.

535
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,580
You haven't joined a court meeting yet, have you?

536
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,030
No, I haven't.

537
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,890
So

538
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,160
you haven't turned 20 years old yet?

539
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,360
I've just reached it.

540
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,690
When is your birthday?

541
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,650
It happens to be on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

542
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,510
August 15th.

543
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,980
Good day.

544
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,770
Why did Lord and Madam Jinchuan

545
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,730
ask me this?

546
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,130
What's so strange about it?

547
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,200
He is my distant grandfather.

548
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,030
I am your brother.

549
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,600
So he is also your distant grandfather.

550
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,660
You're relatives.

551
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,770
It's normal for him

552
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,830
to ask you about your birth date.

553
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,980
We'll stay one more day

554
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,310
and leave early tomorrow morning.

555
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,880
Let's go to Jinchuan's streets tonight.

556
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,720
There are so many girls.

557
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,180
I can't.

558
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,320
I'll be back today.

559
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,550
You're in such a hurry?

560
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,430
I can't wait.

561
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,910
The Poetry and Literature Exam starts now.

562
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,670
Write a poem on the topic of

563
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,140
"Start well and end well".

564
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,580
He really got it right.

565
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,600
It's from the "Da Ya" chapter.

566
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,850
Luckily, I've memorized the entire "Classic of Poetry".

567
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,800
The Math Exam starts now.

568
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,950
Your Ladyship, why don't you go back to your room first?

569
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,390
I'll call you later when the Prince comes.

570
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,190
That's right.

571
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,480
I'll wait a little longer.

572
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,200
Wait.

573
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,230
Wait a little longer.

574
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,380
The Prince is back.

575
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,320
I said it's cold, no need to wait for me.

576
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,040
You're finally back.

577
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,960
What's wrong?

578
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,430
The exam is today.

579
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,720
Your Ladyship…

580
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,920
It's okay.

581
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,350
It's just an exam.

582
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,300
Don't be upset.

583
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,840
You won't ask me about my grade before comforting me?

584
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,900
It doesn't matter what grade you got.

585
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,680
I took

586
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,610
the first place.

587
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,080
The first place!

588
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,830
Prince, you didn't expect it, did you?

589
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,240
She really won the first place.

590
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,270
That's amazing.

591
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,210
What?

592
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,220
You said you'd bring me golden dates.

593
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,820
Here.

594
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,250
So much.

595
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,380
Enjoy it later.

596
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,900
It smells good.

597
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,530
Let's go.

598
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,210
Why did you buy so much?

599
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,230
You'll never guess how I got first place in the exam.

600
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,160
How did you do it?

601
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,990
At first, Nanny Yan thought I had cheated.

602
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,940
I asked for an extra test.

603
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
The days when Prince An is not around

604
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,680
are so relaxing.

605
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,510
I wish he'd never come back.

606
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,720
I'm back.

607
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,930
I'm back.

608
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,240
The trip to Jinchuan was a success.

609
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,180
Can someone get me a hot cup of tea?

610
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,990
They must have waited

611
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,290
too long

612
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,470
and fallen asleep of exhaustion.

613
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,780
That's good.

614
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,389
Sweet home.

615
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,850
All the best, My Lord.

616
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,469
While everyone is here at the morning service,

617
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,199
I have an announcement to make.

618
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,210
Prince Zheng has handled

619
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,239
our debt to Jinchuan.

620
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,600
Not only did he raise the first payment,

621
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,949
but he convinced Lord Jinchuan

622
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,060
on installments

623
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,570
and bought time to turn around.

624
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,909
Prince An also helped a lot.

625
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,679
Thank you for your hard work.

626
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,210
I'm glad we didn't fail you.

627
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,490
This is the end of it for now.

628
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,700
You don't have to scrimp on food and clothing to raise money.

629
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,760
But we still need to be frugal in the future.

630
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,440
That's the only way to last.

631
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:12,690
Yes.

632
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,030
Prince Zheng has contributed a lot this time.

633
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,330
I've decided

634
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,230
to grant him an early qualification for court meetings.

635
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,340
It'll take effect after the New Year.

636
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,430
Thank you, Father.

637
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,630
I will try my best not to disappoint you.

638
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,250
Good.

639
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,750
Father.

640
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,610
Zheng is still young.

641
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,710
I'm afraid it's not right for him to join in court meetings this early.

642
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,730
It is.

643
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,890
But Zheng has done a great service.

644
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,440
He should be commended.

645
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,080
Of course, he can't be what he is

646
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,420
without the help and advice

647
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,800
of his brothers.

648
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,440
When it takes effect,

649
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,740
you can teach him well.

650
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,340
Yes.

651
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,910
Zheng.

652
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,400
Stay here for a while.

653
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,160
Everyone else can leave.

654
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:11,950
Yes.

655
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,720
It's about to be New Year.

656
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,540
You have to get well prepared.

657
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,000
After the New Year, you'll move into the new mansion on an auspicious day.

658
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,130
We'll only know what position to assign you

659
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,660
until the first day of February when the official court starts.

660
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes.

661
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,550
If you have anything to say, just say it.

662
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,150
There are no outsiders here.

663
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,070
I do have a request.

664
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,430
The opening of the new mansion is so complicated.

665
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,450
I need a mistress

666
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,860
to take care of the mansion and its affairs.

667
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,810
So I'd like to

668
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,730
appoint Li from Jichuan as my wife.

669
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,520
Zheng.

670
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,860
You indeed need a mistress.

671
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,230
But Li Wei...

672
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,680
It's indeed not proper for her to do it

673
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,790
if she remained the same.

674
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,300
But she's changed a lot.

675
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,760
And she won the first place in the inner court exam.

676
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,570
I hope Father will allow it.

677
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,010
Is it true?

678
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,220
My Lord.

679
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,450
Li did do very well in the inner court study hall.

680
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,780
If that's the case,

681
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,120
you and Li Wei can

682
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,230
prepare for the opening of the mansion together.

683
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,310
Thank you, Father.

684
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,530
Leave.

685
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,520
Yes.

686
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,690
Stop it here.

687
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,450
Prince Zheng.

688
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,310
Your Ladyship.

689
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,360
This is…

690
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,180
Come on.

691
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,830
Go inside and take a look.

692
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,590
What a large courtyard.

693
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,600
The Lord just gave you this new mansion?

694
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:41,970
Yes.

695
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,430
Congratulations, Your Highness.

696
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,560
The Lord has decreed

697
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,370
after the opening of the mansion next year,

698
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,080
this house will be ours.

699
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,870
Really?

700
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,940
That's great!

701
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,280
Ours?

702
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,400
We'll take this room as a study.

703
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,390
The sideyard will be reserved for Song Wu.

704
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,170
Let's go.

705
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,890
I'll show you the backyard.

706
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,450
[Eastern Courtyard]

707
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,800
This courtyard doesn't look like Xinchuan's style.

708
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,200
It looks like Jichuan's.

709
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,070
That's right.

710
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:27,690
[Main Courtyard]

711
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,800
This yard looks so charming.

712
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,820
We can put some flowers and plants here.

713
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,410
It'll look livelier.

714
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,330
Good.

715
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,700
We'll do what you want.

716
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,620
There's a big piece of land at the back.

717
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,480
The pavilion can be used for entertainment.

718
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,950
We can set up more lights on the road,

719
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,410
so it's brighter at night.

720
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,490
So...

721
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,800
Could you please stay for a few more days

722
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,130
and help me decorate the inner courtyard?

723
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,480
I will be merciful

724
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,870
and do it for you before I leave.

725
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,210
This mansion doesn't have a name yet.

726
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,410
Why don't you name it?

727
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,210
I'll do the restoration and name it.

728
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,650
When your new wife arrives,

729
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,840
I'm sure she'll be unhappy.

730
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,550
It's okay.

731
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,700
Name it.

732
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
How about "Garden of Tranquility"?

733
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,100
You circled the poem "Bai Zhou"

734
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,230
in the "Classic of Poetry" you gave me.

735
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,460
It says

736
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,050
"Quiet thoughts".

737
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,040
It fits you very well.

738
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,450
My heart is not a pebble

739
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,240
and cannot be turned.

740
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,730
My heart is not a mat

741
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,200
and cannot be rolled.

742
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,250
Let's call it the Garden of Tranquility.

743
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,420
Your Ladyship.

744
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,680
Why don't you understand?

745
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,780
Why did you rub salt into his wounds?

746
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,110
There is no new wife.

747
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,140
The Prince wants to make you his wife instead.

748
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,690
Why?

749
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,200
Why?

750
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,070
That's because he heard

751
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:35,000
a woman from Jichuan would be criticized for being a concubine.

752
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,680
He has always been thinking of you.

753
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,280
If you have to go back,

754
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,010
he wants to protect you.

755
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,770
Even if he can't let you go,

756
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,140
he won't force you to stay.

757
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,900
Do you think you need to decorate the inner courtyard?

758
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,390
I can do it too.

759
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,050
And you have to name it?

760
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,860
Can't he name it himself?

761
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,820
Take a good look at the courtyard.

762
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,280
Look.

763
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,630
Look at this courtyard.

764
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,160
Why did he find a courtyard just like Jichuan's?

765
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,850
Why?

766
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,450
Why do you think the Prince did this?

767
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,080
Because he likes you.

768
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,300
He really likes you.

769
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,760
I'm desperate, Your Ladyship.

770
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,240
My Prince.

771
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,120
My poor Prince.

772
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,830
Be careful.

773
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:47,770
Thank you.

774
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,640
Be careful with the vase.

775
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,690
Your Ladyship.

776
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,210
Your Ladyship.

777
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,200
Prince Zheng drew you a picture for your reference

778
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,860
in case you get tired.

779
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,230
He drew it.

780
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,040
Prince Zheng understands you, Your Ladyship.

781
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,130
The drawing is exactly the same

782
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,750
as your layout.

783
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,850
The drawing is quite detailed.

784
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,910
Your Ladyship.

785
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,600
Don't blame me for saying too much.

786
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,760
We can see it.

787
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,410
Prince Zheng actually

788
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,440
thinks of you.

789
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,000
Prince Zheng has been a bit strange lately.

790
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,530
That's because he wants you to care about him.

791
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,460
You go and tell him…

792
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,260
Tell him

793
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,040
I want to talk to him about Baifu's kennel.

794
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,450
Okay.

795
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,760
Your Ladyship, I guess Prince Zheng would even know

796
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,800
what Baifu's kennel looks like

797
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,510
when hearing this.

798
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,370
He won't.

799
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,610
You're letting Baifu live in a house like this?

800
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,380
I must make you wooden clogs,

801
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,480
so you don't walk without a sound.

802
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,270
That's very considerate of you.

803
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,240
But

804
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,730
this is too luxurious, isn't it?

805
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,550
A dog's ancestor is a wolf.

806
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,950
Wolves are cave animals.

807
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,260
The door is wide open.

808
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,430
Baifu won't go in.

809
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,310
Add a door.

810
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,320
And the roof can be lifted,

811
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,460
so that I can clean the doghouse.

812
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,540
I also need to make the workers

813
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,550
clean the bottom of the doghouse

814
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,590
before painting it.

815
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,270
Otherwise, the burrs

816
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,490
will hurt Baifu's feet.

817
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,230
There.

818
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,070
It's really nice.

819
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,170
Thank you for your willingness to take care of the mansion.

820
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,150
You're not angry with me anymore?

821
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,210
I've never been angry with you.

822
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,160
I have to go now.

823
00:45:59,350 --> 00:45:59,810
Prince.

824
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,820
You made me win the first place in the study hall

825
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,610
not for the sake of court meetings, right?

826
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,050
That's the only way

827
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:23,990
I can make you my wife.

828
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,670
I'm sure there will be better ones in the future…

829
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,250
There won't be anymore.

830
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,540
What people think I like

831
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,840
is not what I truly like.

832
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,470
So

833
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,000
you're saying…

834
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,310
Yes.

835
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,450
I like you.

836
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,340
♫The south wind meets the clouds♫

837
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,010
♫And the moonlight calls the candle♫

838
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:41,790
♫As far as the eye can see, it's just a regular sight♫

839
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:49,270
♫Why am I being absent-minded? And why am I hesitating?♫

840
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,300
♫I'm worried that you'll see through my mind by my eyes♫

841
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,220
♫My words are not surprising. Nor is my language inaccurate♫

842

♫I've got some affection towards you♫

00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,930

♫Who should I tell about the one I love?♫

845
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:19,830
♫By now, my words have turned into wind, and my missing of you has melted into fog♫

846
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,590
♫I wrote about the past into a letter♫

847
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:29,250
♫If you and I know each other well, there's no need to write more♫

848
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,150
♫My mind runs wild, and I don't know where is the way to go back♫

849
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,640
♫I love you deeply and there's nothing else I ask for♫

850
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:43,700
♫I only wish the two of us could love each other as one soul, eat three meals together and spend the four seasons together♫
