5
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,979
Here.

6
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,650
I made four kinds of sauce.

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,270
The signature combination of different flavors.

8
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,130
The classic smoky flavor.

9
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,430
This is lemon pepper.

10
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,270
This is sesame oil-garlic mixture.

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
It smells so good.

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:05,920
Delicious.

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,880
Yes, it smells good.

14
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,180
I didn't expect

15
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,810
my daughter had learned to cook.

16
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,610
Of course...

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,120
Of course not.

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,890
This is all I can make.

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,840
It's not that easy to make the seasoning.

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,590
It also requires skills to make it.

21
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,680
Where's my son-in-law?

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,810
Why hasn't he come out yet?

23
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,690
There he is.

24
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,180
Sorry to keep you waiting.

25
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,579
Isn't this what we saw in Danchuan?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,329
Yes.

27
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,850
I learned it from Baoquan,

28
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,950
but cannot do it very well for now.

29
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,150
So delicate.

30
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,500
What's wrong?

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
You don't like it?

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,020
I like it.

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:44,920
Try it.

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,910
So sweet.

35
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,680
And it's carved so well.

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,340
You're so good.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,870
Look.

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,550
Your son-in-law treats Wei so well.

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,220
You should have nothing to worry about.

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,480
My son-in-law is good.

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,760
My son-in-law is good.

42
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,150
His cooking skill...

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,720
Of course,

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,960
compared to the chefs in our Jichuan,

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,320
he still needs to work hard to make progress.

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,850
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,740
Yes, it needs to be improved.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,910
Today, seeing you two register your marriage,

49
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,990
I can't help feeling a little bit sad.

50
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,200
Son-in-law,

51
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,890
you drink first.

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,860
Father.

53
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,420
Yin Zheng can't drink.

54
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,810
One's personality can be reflected by his drinking habit.

55
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,210
It's good that you can't drink.

56
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,420
Let me test it today.

57
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,450
Test it!

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,770
I'm definitely reliable.

59
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,470
Really?

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,650
Don't drink too much.

61
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,750
My daughter

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,230
is like a deity.

63
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,470
Why did she just marry you, a Xinchuan guy?

64
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,560
You're talking nonsense with just a few drinks, aren't you?

65
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,100
Your mother got angry with me at that time

66
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,050
and was to go to Xinchuan to ask for an explanation.

67
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,390
You married...

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,730
Princess Jinchuan, right?

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,019
Luckily, Wei wrote to us

70
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,070
to explain the situation to us.

71
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,220
Otherwise,

72
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,030
I really was to

73
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,320
ask for an explanation for my daughter.

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
It's all in the past.

75
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,360
Listen to me.

76
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,950
Listen to me.

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,530
I am...

78
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,070
I really love Wei.

79
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,790
I mean it.

80
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,420
I will treat her well for my whole life,

81
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,450
just like you do.

82
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,100
I swear.

83
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,050
I swear.

84
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,980
I heard it.

85
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,460
Fine.

86
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,490
Remember what you said.

87
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,770
If anyone treats Wei badly,

88
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,620
I'll protect her even if I die a hundred times.

89
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,160
Father.

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,890
If anyone dares to bully her...

91
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,660
Let's drink.

92
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,460
Stop drinking.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,830
It's enough.

94
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,240
Alright.

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,970
It's enough.

96
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,630
Father.

97
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,500
Father.

98
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,880
Father!

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,560
Alright.

100
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,530
It's okay.

101
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,420
Li Cang, you and your sister

102
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,310
take your brother-in-law to your sister's room.

103
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,640
I'll carry your father.

104
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,500
Hurry up.

105
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,330
Take him back.

106
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,670
It seems that he's even worse at drinking than me.

107
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,510
You always get so drunk!

108
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,230
I even haven't drunk half a pot of liquor.

109
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,290
Be careful.

110
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,020
Put it away.

111
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,850
Alright.

112
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,800
That's it.

113
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,230
When your father wakes up tomorrow, he'll wash it.

114
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,560
Or let Yin Zheng wash it.

115
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,760
Really?

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Yes.

117
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,430
Here, Mother.

118
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,710
Wei.

119
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,290
I'm just worried that you've been spoiled too much at home,

120
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,810
and can't stand the wind and rain outside.

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,290
But I really can't help spoiling you.

122
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,330
Today I saw that my son-in-law

123
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,870
is a capable and responsible man.

124
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,560
I feel much more relieved now.

125
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,630
Mother.

126
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,720
Mother!

127
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,620
Bad news.

128
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Brother-in-law seems quite drunk.

129
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,980
You silly boy.

130
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,560
If that's the case, just go in and take care of him.

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,890
Okay.

132
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,140
Wait.

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,530
Get your brother-in-law a bowl of sober-up soup.

134
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,700
Silly boy.

135
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,159
I've taught him for many times.

136
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,600
He's still bad at taking care of others.

137
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,150
But this time I feel that

138
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,510
Li Cang has grown up a lot.

139
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,110
Really?

140
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,320
It's time for Yin Zheng to drink some sober-up soup.

141
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,470
He's really bad at drinking.

142
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,670
We drank last time...

143
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,100
No.

144
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,830
No.

145
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,960
You can't go.

146
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,570
Li Cang!

147
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,490
He'll kiss others when drunk.

148
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,580
What is she talking about?

149
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,920
Brother-in-law, why are you up?

150
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,320
Here.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,860
Sober-up soup.

152
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,950
I don't want it.

153
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,280
Take a sip.

154
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,200
No.

155
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,090
I'm not drunk.

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,390
Brother-in-law, you can't be like this.

157
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,890
Brother-in-law!

158
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,220
Yin Zheng, let go of him!

159
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,850
Let go of what?

160
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,950
Leave it to me.

161
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
You go back first.

162
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:07,850
Be good.

163
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,860
Go to sleep, okay?

164
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,660
Let's go.

165
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,020
Are you Li Wei?

166
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,410
No, I am Li Cang.

167
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,620
Let's go.

168
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,570
You little weasel,

169
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,030
still wanting to trick me!

170
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,110
You are

171
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,179
Li Wei.

172
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,520
You're picky about not only food,

173
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,470
but also people, aren't you?

174
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,970
Hurry up.

175
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,680
Otherwise, it'll be late to get to Xinchuan.

176
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,320
Okay.

177
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,740
Jiaoniang, don't worry.

178
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,680
“Jiaoniang" is...

179
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,750
My mother's pet name is Mei [meaning "beautiful" in Chinese].

180
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,880
My father thinks my mother is good in everything,

181
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,010
so he styled her

182
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,990
"Mei Jiaoniang".

183
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,420
Get in!

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,800
When I understood its implications, I really thought it's way too... "romantic".

185
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
You don't think it's good?

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,720
Your mother is good in everything,

187
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,420
and so many men pursued her back then.

188
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,010
Prince Zheng,

189
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,460
I dare not say anything else.

190
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,800
In terms of loving our wives,

191
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,960
you should learn from me.

192
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,690
Yes, I will.

193
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,830
Get in.

194
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,660
Father.

195
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,640
Are we really going to give up the carriage

196
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,210
and go back to Xinchuan in the donkey carriage?

197
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,870
The donkey was with us the first time you were sent to Xinchuan.

198
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,320
This time, it should still be with us on the way to Xinchuan.

199
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,650
Here.

200
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,610
[Live up to the good times.]

201
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
My Lady!

202
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,590
You're awake.

203
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,080
It's time to wake up, My Lady.

204
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,560
My Lady!

205
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,400
You can't sleep anymore.

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,360
They're already here.

207
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,720
Yes.

208
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
What people?

209
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,780
The ones who dress you up, My Lady.

210
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,890
Your Ladyship.

211
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,350
Right.

212
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,010
I'm getting married today.

213
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,710
Why isn't Zheng here yet?

214
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,760
Wait a little longer.

215
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,690
What's the rush?

216
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,650
You don't know.

217
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,000
Zheng's long been looking forward to this day.

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,100
He finally got what he wanted today.

219
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,230
Zheng is lucky to marry Li Wei.

220
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,710
Yes.

221
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,270
Li Wei is so nice.

222
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,160
She knows how to live a good life and take care of others.

223
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,960
That's great.

224
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,540
Yes.

225
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,170
I'm not capable of that.

226
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,340
I didn't mean that.

227
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,470
You shouldn't always think you're the one to blame.

228
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,140
You don't need to be capable of that.

229
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,800
You have me.

230
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,170
I'll take care of you.

231
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,770
In less than three years,

232
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,840
how many times has Zheng gotten married?

233
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,200
It should be four times

234
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,620
with the wedding included.

235
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,350
That's all you care about?

236
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,880
No wonder that he can gain happiness

237
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,600
while you can only be single and lonely.

238
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000
It was just a casual chat.

239
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,480
He was just messing around,

240
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,860
right?

241
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,990
He only has one wife.

242
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,160
But I have so many...

243
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,240
partners.

244
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,730
We are the best.

245
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,390
They are finally together with their beloved ones.

246
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,850
I'm really happy for them.

247
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,870
When you find someone who truly loves you,

248
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,980
you can just go after him.

249
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,040
We'll support you.

250
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,320
Although there are many people today,

251
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,020
I'm not that nervous.

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,830
Me too.

253
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Maybe it's because

254
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,060
it's the wedding of the Sixth Prince and Wei.

255
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,360
If it were the wedding of someone else,

256
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,920
I would still be nervous.

257
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,910
What's wrong with you?

258
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,900
I really envy Zheng now.

259
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,600
When can I get a companion?

260
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,920
You don't deserve it now.

261
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,930
You need to become less greasy first.

262
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,590
Prince Yue,

263
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,700
if you are willing,

264
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,460
I can cook some grease-removing dishes for you.

265
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,300
Get away!

266
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,480
You two eat it yourselves.

267
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,080
Ignore him.

268
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,680
Annoying.

269
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,870
Mei.

270
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,620
Will Wei wear the wedding dress you made?

271
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,630
Yes.

272
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,860
I'm not good at sewing.

273
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,350
But I've been doing it since she was ten,

274
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,740
and finally finished it shortly before.

275
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,920
But Wei

276
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,890
made lots of efforts

277
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,280
to get the permission not to wear the wedding dress sent from the palace.

278
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,200
The dress is also a token of your love as her mother.

279
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,650
Wei

280
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,550
has finally gotten her own wedding.

281
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,880
My daughter has grown up.

282
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,190
I really don't want her to leave us.

283
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,790
Honey.

284
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,580
Honey.

285
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,860
Xinchuan Lord is still here.

286
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,390
Besides, isn't this a happy thing?

287
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,860
Our daughter has grown up.

288
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,790
We should let her have her own life.

289
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,510
From now on,

290
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,530
let's well live our own life.

291
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,120
I'll be with you.

292
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,990
There are only we two being together...

293
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,100
It's too lonely.

294
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,360
Father, Mother.

295
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,880
Till now,

296
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,330
you still think my sister is the only child in the family?

297
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,460
Alright, honey.

298
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,400
It's so hard.

299
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,520
Finally, this day has come.

300
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,520
It's not easy.

301
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,750
Butler Su, calm down.

302
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,910
I'll try my best.

303
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,370
Look, Su Shen's crying so hard,

304
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,030
as if his beloved one ran away with someone else.

305
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,870
Congratulations.

306
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,170
Coming.

307
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,970
Coming.

308
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,330
Coming.

309
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,240
The newlyweds are here.

310
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,830
So pretty!

311
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,130
Good!

312
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,390
Time for the bride to put down the hand fan.

313
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,950
Yin Zheng, the Sixth Prince of Xinchuan,

314
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,710
and Mrs. Li from Jichuan, here's the imperial edict for you.

315
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,430
Mrs. Li from Jichuan is with gentleness, virtue, high morality, good manners,

316
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,360
chastity, and proper words and deeds.

317
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,760
I hereby ennoble you as Lady of the Sixth Prince

318
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,360
to officially pronounce you two husband and wife.

319
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,170
You two are hoped to love and respect each other,

320
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,470
and live with conjugal bliss.

321
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,660
-Your words are to be obeyed, Lord. -Your words are to be obeyed, Lord.

322
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,730
From now on,

323
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,340
you should depend on each other in good times and in woe,

324
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,830
and grow old together.

325
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,630
Treat your wife well.

326
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,800
May you have each other to lean on,

327
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,050
and live safely for a lifetime.

328
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,830
-Yes.-Yes.

329
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,650
We will.

330
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,900
The ceremony is completed.

331
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,810
Great!

332
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,089
[Garden of Tranquility]

333
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,790
How can you eat the things put on bed?

334
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,000
After being with you for a long time,

335
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
I always want to eat at night.

336
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,880
You went to get wine?

337
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,440
Although we've been married for a long time,

338
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,900
it's still better to go through the rituals.

339
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,790
To drink the nuptial cup with you and give you a formal wedding,

340
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,790
I finally made it.

341
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,140
Cheers,

342
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,740
Lady Wei.

343
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,910
Why is this sweet?

344
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,040
This is the rice wine

345
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,140
with fruit juice added to make it lighter,

346
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,580
as well as some mint,

347
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,790
so that it tastes more like wine.

348
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,770
But it won't make you drunk.

349
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,900
Really?

350
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,650
You'll get drunk if you drink like this.

351
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,530
Then that will be great.

352
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,110
Stop drinking.

353
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,470
Why are you greedy for drinking now?

354
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,960
What's wrong?

355
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,440
Are you okay?

356
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,120
I still feel a little drunk.

357
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,360
I told you not to drink so much...

358
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,720
I have glutinous sugar in my mouth.

359
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,270
Madam Chuan has been resting since she's not feeling well.

360
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,310
I'm in charge of the palace affairs.

361
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,600
I can't handle it sometimes.

362
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,530
Will you help me?

363
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,410
As long as Madam He...

364
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,500
As long as Mother hopes so,

365
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,570
I will do my best.

366
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,140
The womenfolk in many officials' mansions

367
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,800
only want tutors to go to their home to teach,

368
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,330
and refuse to go to the inner court study hall.

369
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,280
We've both studied there,

370
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,220
and know what the problem is.

371
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,420
If we want to change it,

372
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,050
do you have any idea?

373
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,380
I...

374
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,570
As the Crown Prince,

375
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,390
Yin Zheng has the duty to supervise both the inner and outer courts,

376
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,200
so do you.

377
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,620
Just say it.

378
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,770
If you say something wrong,

379
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,460
we can just take it as a gossip.

380
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,580
Nowadays, more and more women

381
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,320
are willing to go out like us,

382
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,940
working, doing business and making a living on their own.

383
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,690
The womenfolk in the officials' mansions

384
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,350
are even more knowledgeable.

385
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,810
If they're just confined in the inner court study hall

386
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,240
to learn to be obedient to men and raise children,

387
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,100
of course they will be unwilling.

388
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,360
So you think

389
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,520
the study hall can teach them how to make a living?

390
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,480
Xinchuan has changed a bit over the past few years.

391
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,800
Women have gained more freedom.

392
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,990
It also proves that

393
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,650
women can also contribute a lot to Xinchuan.

394
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,100
But Xinchuan is still firm in upholding its tradition.

395
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,640
So we can't rush forward.

396
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,730
Prince Zheng has to go review memorials in the palace every day.

397
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,370
Of course he needs to leave early and come home late.

398
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,280
I never thought

399
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,840
you would also have to write memorials

400
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
after becoming the Crown Princess.

401
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,720
The more happiness you enjoy, the more responsibilities you should shoulder.

402
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,850
Do you have any idea?

403
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,500
The problem is that I have too many ideas!

404
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,530
I have in my heart countless scoldings

405
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,260
for the inner court study hall.

406
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,490
But I have to come up with an idea

407
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,310
that won't offend anyone

408
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,860
while still contributing to the reform.

409
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,680
That's it.

410
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,850
My Lady is really behaving like a lady now.

411
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,090
Wasn't I before?

412
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,280
-Not at all. -Not at all.

413
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,130
Hurry up and write.

414
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,010
You're back.

415
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,300
What time is it?

416
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,270
It's midnight.

417
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,150
It's so late.

418
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,260
Yes.

419
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,280
It's late.

420
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,820
It's time to sleep.

421
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,310
Have you had dinner?

422
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,230
I ate the pastries you prepared for me.

423
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,280
My Lady.

424
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,030
Sorry for disturbing you.

425
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,630
Come back.

426
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:07,600
It's too wet?

427
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,260
Your Highness.

428
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,690
Greetings, Mother.

429
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,210
I'm not surprised that you've abolished the lectures on Commandments for Women.

430
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,120
I thought you would establish courses on business ethics.

431
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,930
But you just suggested a course on diet in the study hall.

432
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,310
Yes.

433
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,080
But the course won't be for teaching the womenfolk how to cook.

434
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,610
It'll be for teaching them how they should adjust their diets

435
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,800
so as to become healthier.

436
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,360
They can learn how to keep in good health with reasonable food collocations.

437
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,890
Women who've mastered it can be dietitians,

438
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
and food tasters.

439
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,340
Such professionals are exactly needed

440
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,400
in our Nine Regions Food Collection.

441
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,800
Sit down.

442
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,440
You want to select talents

443
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,040
for your Women’s Chamber of Commerce, right?

444
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,620
Not entirely.

445
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,510
I think

446
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,210
what we eat is indispensable to our daily life.

447
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,030
To start with the daily things in life

448
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,360
may make the reform more easily accepted.

449
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,160
If a woman can eat to her own will,

450
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,260
then she can gradually dress to her own will,

451
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,140
go outside to her own will,

452
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,700
and follow her own way.

453
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,800
Excellent!

454
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,340
[Memorial to be reviewed by the Nine Regions for selecting new courses.]

455
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,120
Ridiculous!

456
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,340
Your Ladyship, you've just taken office.

457
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,120
I didn't expect that you specially asked me to come

458
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,780
just for abandoning the ancestral traditions.

459
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,680
How dare you disobey the rules set by our ancestors?

460
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,260
The Commandments for Women

461
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,240
are what women in Xinchuan must learn for getting sheltered.

462
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,300
How can I let you abolish the lecture?

463
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Nanny, calm down.

464
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,290
Rules are set by people.

465
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,680
So we should consider

466
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,280
women's demands at present.

467
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,550
Nowadays, women

468
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,650
want to walk out of the backyard

469
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,620
and to embrace the vast world.

470
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,440
To abolish the Commandments for Women

471
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,810
is just for allowing them

472
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,080
to learn more useful things

473
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,480
within the limited time.

474
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,090
Do you really think it's not good?

475
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,130
Nonsense.

476
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,300
Madam He has approved it.

477
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,460
Are you going to disobey Madam He?

478
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,080
Then let Madam He talk to me in person.

479
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,870
Otherwise, I will never agree to it.

480
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,320
I'll go invite Madam He here.

481
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,590
Let's see if she still dares to be so arrogant.

482
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,440
We can't make a big deal out of this.

483
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,120
It won't be easy to carry forward the reform.

484
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,150
If we disturb Madam He

485
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,680
with such trivial matters,

486
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,660
then we will encounter

487
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,300
more troubles.

488
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,010
Yes, My Lady.

489
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,490
But Nanny Yan won't accept it.

490
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,930
What should we do?

491
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,370
Then let's teach her a lesson.

492
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,000
What are you doing?

493
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
You want to rebel against me?

494
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,630
Nanny Yan must have heard in the palace

495
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,270
of Nine Regions Food Collection.

496
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,280
We invited you here today

497
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,000
to let you taste

498
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
our dishes.

499
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,830
I won't eat your food.

500
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,980
Let me go.

501
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,480
Or I'll report this to the Department of Internal Affairs

502
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,670
and you'll suffer.

503
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,940
If you don't finish these dishes,

504
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,390
we will make you suffer.

505
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,400
How dare you!

506
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,490
Of course I dare.

507
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,230
If you finish the dishes, then we'll let you go.

508
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,270
But if you don't,

509
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,550
we can only force you to eat.

510
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,840
You want to force me?

511
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,570
I'm warning you.

512
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,290
If you insist on it,

513
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,300
even if you kill me,

514
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,850
I still won't eat.

515
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,520
I really admire your being so determined.

516
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,190
What do you mean?

517
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,460
If you want to leave now,

518
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,930
you can leave anytime.

519
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,970
But if you are willing to stay

520
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,900
to help taste the dishes of our restaurant,

521
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,990
we will be very grateful.

522
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,650
We just forced you to eat.

523
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,230
You must feel quite annoyed.

524
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,980
It shows that no one

525
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,420
wants to be forced into doing something,

526
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,650
even if it's eating.

527
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,280
Only when you're willing to eat

528
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,650
can you taste the deliciousness.

529
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,640
Nanny,

530
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,770
are you willing to eat with us now?

531
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,820
Fine.

532
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,130
I don't think you dare to poison me.

533
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,120
Here are four kinds of sauce.

534
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
You can collocate the sauce with the dishes

535
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,390
according to the taste you like.

536
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,910
Sorry for scaring you just now.

537
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,790
You are a kind person.

538
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,590
We also learned about it.

539
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,960
You haven't been able to leave the palace till now

540
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,990
because

541
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,400
you gave the only chance of leaving the palace

542
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,330
to the maid who entered the palace together with you.

543
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,390
You were also willing to sympathize with others in those years.

544
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,740
But now, why do you refuse to accept

545
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,040
the reform of the inner court study hall?

546
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,700
If we can take this first step,

547
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,970
we may be able to change the palace rules.

548
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,580
Maybe

549
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,660
no one will have to repeat your past.

550
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,750
The old friend who left the palace

551
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,560
didn't learn the rules well in the palace

552
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,870
and didn't follow the Commandments for Women,

553
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,010
so she was abandoned by her husband

554
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,420
and passed away in less than a year.

555
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,290
Once the inner court study hall

556
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,140
fails to let women know what they should follow,

557
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,000
then have you ever thought about what they will face in the future?

558
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,560
So...

559
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,630
Nanny's been so strict with us

560
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,310
so that we can learn the rules

561
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,490
and live a better life?

562
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,210
I'm sorry.

563
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,700
I wronged you before.

564
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,500
Do you really agree with these rules?

565
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,170
I don't think so.

566
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,660
Just like me back then,

567
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,130
I gave up on myself,

568
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,570
just wanting to get sheltered by a man.

569
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,300
But if you just give in,

570
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,600
you still can't get anything.

571
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,220
The true happiness

572
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,630
can only be created by ourselves.

573
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,400
If we learn more skills, we don't need to rely on others.

574
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,530
Don't worry, Nanny.

575
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,830
No matter how the inner court study hall changes,

576
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,560
your status won't change.

577
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,020
Nanny.

578
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,940
We understand your care and thought.

579
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,960
Maybe sometimes we can benefit

580
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,570
from sticking to the old rules.

581
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,280
But time has changed.

582
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,420
Things are different now.

583
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,070
We're willing to change.

584
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,120
We're not afraid of changing.

585
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,710
Would you please

586
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,170
give us a chance?

587
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,200
Lady Wei's sauce is indeed delicious.

588
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,990
I'll bring you more next time.

589
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,370
Try this.

590
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,570
This is delicious too.

591
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,310
These ribs have been stewed for hours.

592
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,690
This is the signature of the restaurant.

593
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,760
Yin Zheng?

594
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,520
I brought midnight snacks.

595
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,600
Yin...

596
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,910
He's asleep?

597
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,070
Got you.

598
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,920
You pretended to be asleep.

599
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,580
Why are you back later than me?

600
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,450
Did it go well?

601
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,450
Only soft persuasion works on Nanny Yan.

602
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,700
It was a bit troublesome.

603
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,050
But it's all settled.

604
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,210
I knew my wife could make it.

605
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,140
You're the best.

606
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,070
Go to sleep.

607
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:42,550
Otherwise, you won't be able to get up on time tomorrow.

608
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,250
We only have so little time being together in a day.

609
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,310
It can't be wasted.

610
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:47,970
What?

611
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,880
If you don't sleep now,

612
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,030
you won't be able to get up on time tomorrow.

613
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,409
I finally see you now.

614
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,389
I don't want to sleep.

615
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,920
You miss me so much?

616
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,030
Yes.

617
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,850
I really really really miss you.

618
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,030
You are so busy every day.

619
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,810
You don't even have time to eat, do you?

620
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,139
How about you

621
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,000
make a to-do list every day?

622
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,080
To-do list?

623
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,350
Make each quarter scheduled in detail.

624
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,870
Things should be scheduled according to the order of priority.

625
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,690
Those who want to see you should make an appointment

626
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,230
over the time and content of the meeting.

627
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,020
And then the time for you to eat should be set aside.

628
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,980
In this way,

629
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,800
when it's time to eat,

630
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,930
Su Shen can go remind the kitchen of it.

631
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,310
Good idea.

632
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,870
The schedule's clear.

633
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,200
In this way,

634
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,630
I can know your time

635
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,580
and then spare my time

636
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,280
so that we can see each other.

637
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,880
Even if it's only a quarter,

638
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,140
I still hope to see you.

639
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,670
A quarter...

640
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,300
That's not enough, right?

641
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,020
Can't you just be serious?

642
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,950
I'm gonna sleep.

643
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,440
Not only should I make schedules.

644
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,600
You should also make schedules.

645
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,800
Since you're so busy,

646
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,480
I also need to know your plan.

647
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,590
Sleep.

648
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,540
You've done well in handling state affairs

649
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,810
during my absence from the court.

650
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,160
You're praised a lot in the court.

651
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
During my patrol,

652
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,610
I found that the new currency is in circulation

653
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,800
even in the border towns.

654
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
What's more interesting is that

655
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,440
the further south I went,

656
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,890
the more businesswomen I could see outside,

657
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,040
which contributes a lot to the local taxes.

658
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,850
On the contrary, in Xinchuan's capital,

659
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,040
though there's a Women’s Chamber of Commerce,

660
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,480
the scale still needs to be expanded.

661
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,840
Lord, if you have the intention,

662
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,800
you can just issue an edict.

663
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,060
Our capital will be more promising than those in the south.

664
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,210
In that case,

665
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,600
you can

666
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,220
make the decision on your own.

667
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,160
I mean

668
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,340
you can continue to be in charge of the court affairs.

669
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,020
I'm used to being idle now.

670
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,300
It's time to let go

671
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,320
and anneal you.

672
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,410
Yes.

673
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,730
Zheng.

674
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,750
I'll go to court next month.

675
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,730
Father hopes me

676
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,450
to return to the Ministry of Rites first.

677
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,800
Congratulations, Jun.

678
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,440
Although it has been a long time,

679
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,120
I still owe you an apology.

680
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,580
In Canghe,

681
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,360
I shouldn't have

682
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,970
been blinded by greed

683
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,560
and put you in danger.

684
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,050
Jun, you've changed a lot this time.

685
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,390
I've seen a lot during the patrol with Father.

686
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,120
To promote the new currency in an innovative way

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,900
is beneficial to the people's livelihood.

688
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,000
Of course,

689
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,870
you also did all this for your own good.

690
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,690
But everyone can see that

691
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,560
you've considered more for the public.

692
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,740
If I were you,

693
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,530
I wouldn't be able to make it.

694
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,650
Actually, I admire you.

695
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,810
You had many roads to choose

696
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,560
to get to where you are now.

697
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,890
But the one you chose

698
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,220
is the roughest.

699
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,490
Jun,

700
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,990
what's your plan for the future?

701
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,490
Father has left me no other choice.

702
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,290
I have no other hope.

703
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,820
I just hope to well raise my son

704
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,470
with Xiyuan.

705
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,070
There's not much important work in the Ministry of Rites.

706
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,400
I'm afraid it may be a waste of your talent.

707
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,120
If I transfer you to the Nine Regions Affairs Division,

708
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,470
what do you think?

709
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,790
Are you still willing to believe in me?

710
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,410
To connect with the Nine Regions needs a man of worldly wisdom.

711
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,140
You're the best man for the job.

712
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,910
If you can manage the Nine Regions Affairs Division,

713
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,910
you'll have greater achievements.

714
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,810
Zheng, after you.

715
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,690
[Zhaoqian Hall]

716
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,540
Your Highness.

717
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,730
Prince Zheng

718
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,820
has been busy recently.

719
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,110
Don't forget to stand up to exercise

720
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,240
every time an incense stick burns out.

721
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,520
Remember to have three meals a day.

722
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,760
Try to have extra meals and remember to miss me.

723
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,960
This is the right way.

724
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,370
Besides,

725
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,200
according to your to-do list,

726
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,260
you can rest for half a day in two days.

727
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,080
So I'd like to invite you

728
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,800
to go travel with me

729
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,020
and enjoy the spring scenery.

730
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,660
Your Highness,

731
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,890
this must be the letter Her Ladyship wrote to you.

732
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,360
What did Her Ladyship write?

733
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,640
It makes you so happy.

734
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,070
Is Lady Wei in the palace?

735
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,170
Yes, she's in the Palace of Peace.

736
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,080
Help me deliver something to her.

737
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,700
Just do it.

738
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,060
Your Ladyship.

739
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,100
This is the list of new maids.

740
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,260
Those in the last two lines

741
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,030
are the ones looking pretty.

742
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,110
Why?

743
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,200
It's the conventional rule of the palace.

744
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,780
Most Ladies

745
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,520
don't want the pretty maids

746
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,370
to serve the Princes close by.

747
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,000
Thank you, Nanny Liu.

748
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,060
But we should still

749
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,460
judge

750
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,530
from their morality and abilities.

751
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,660
We can't deprive them of their chances

752
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,980
just because they are pretty.

753
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,790
But what if His Highness falls in love with one of them?

754
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,800
He won't.

755
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:10,880
Yes.

756
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,090
Yes.

757
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,590
My Lady.

758
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,750
Please eat.

759
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,170
It'll get cold soon.

760
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,950
His Highness asked me to bring you this.

761
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,840
This is his favorite dish.

762
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,100
Why did he send it to me?

763
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,100
The Imperial Kitchen knows His Highness likes it,

764
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,920
and specially made it for His Highness.

765
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,120
But His Highness said

766
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,200
the fresh shepherd's purse in this season is rare,

767
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,330
so he asked me to bring it to you.

768
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,390
[Message received, looking forward to enjoying the spring scenery with you.]

769
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:03,940
My Lady!

770
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,640
Prince Zheng has agreed

771
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,100
to go travel with you the day after tomorrow?

772
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,220
Your Ladyship,

773
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,840
do you like it?

774
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,600
Butler Su,

775
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,640
please deliver this dish

776
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,730
to His Highness.

777
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,060
He likes it.

778
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,150
OK.

779
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,880
Prince Zheng and Lady Wei are so much in love.

780
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,940
Even a dish can be a carrier of their love for each other.

781
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,770
Your Highness.

782
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,850
Her Ladyship was so happy

783
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,520
when seeing what you sent to her.

784
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,840
So,

785
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,530
she asked me to bring you this dish.

786
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,960
[Got it!]

787
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,660
Your Highness.

788
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,680
Could you please write a few more words

789
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,050
so that I don't have to go to and fro for that many times...

790
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,020
How about this?

791
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,120
Prepare a carriage for me the day after tomorrow.

792
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,450
Okay.

793
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,150
I'll take Her Ladyship to a place.

794
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,700
To where?

795
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,240
The scenery is so beautiful.

796
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,890
How did you find this place?

797
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:35,570
Do you like it?

798
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:37,540
Yes.

799
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,410
Then we can be buried here in the future.

800
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,660
You don't have a fever.

801
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,300
Y-Y-You don't like it?

802
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,610
This is the best mountain in Xinchuan

803
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,690
in terms of its location...

804
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,890
That should be decades later.

805
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,480
I just want to tell you

806
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,030
I want to be together with you forever,

807
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,030
even after we die.

808
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,120
We'll never be separated even if we're white-headed.

809
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,890
This is not "never being separated even if we're white-headed".

810
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,080
This is "never being separated even if we're reduced to bones".

811
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,480
Our Prince Zheng is really extraordinary.

812
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,520
Even his way of being romantic is distinctive.

813
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,480
You haven't told me whether you're willing or not.

814
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,620
Yes, I'm willing.

815
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,830
I'm willing to be with you forever.
