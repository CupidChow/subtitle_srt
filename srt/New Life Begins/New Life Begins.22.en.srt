both the layout and the printing

14
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,190
will be approved by Xinchuan,

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,650
so that Xinchuan will be clear of

16
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,950
the revenue of each region.

17

You are a son-in-law of Jinchuan after all.

The advantages and disadvantages have always been twofold.

27

We have clearly stated in the contract

28
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,710
that the printing must be made public.

29

95
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,760
It facilitates the negotiation too.

96

that you often travel to Mochuan

108
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,560
and is tired of alcohol.

109

112
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,500
The Prince has told me

113
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,790
you're a nice person, but you have a weak stomach.

114
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,200
So the same advice for you.

115
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,450
Thank you for your kindness.

116
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,620
I can't believe you remember all these little things.

117
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,010
There are no little things in terms of health.

118
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,460

119
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,280

I was so nervous.

126
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,870
Today, Ms. Yuan Ying said

127
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,630
she'd stay home and take care of the accounts.

128
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

129

And you.

130

you're capable of doing it yourself now.

134

136

That's necessary.

137
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,180
Aren't you afraid that word will get out

138
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,960
and people can say that you're spoiling your concubine?

139
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,540
If I had such a reputation,

140
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,800
no one would ever make his daughter marry me again.

146

He is so arrogant.

147
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,140
I wouldn't dare to do him in front of you.

148

Look how they beat me up.

149
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,850
They went too far.

150
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,730
They allowed women to open a restaurant?

151
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,580
My men also said

152
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,670
there were messengers from other regions in and out.

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,180
He wants to get over me.

154
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,370
That's right, brother.

155
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,260
This is not a slap in my face.

156
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:37,990
This is...

157
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,630
This is a slap in your face.

158
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,280
But then again,

159
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,390
the emissaries

160
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,850
are happy

161
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,620
to have their hometown food there

162
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,730
and getting closer to Zheng.

163
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,770
Great!

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,570
The bastard is going overweening.

165
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,760
I'd like to see

166
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,440
how far he can go.

167
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,550
Your Highness. Your Ladyship.

168
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,450
Don't worry, Your Highness.

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,970
The ambassadors of the regions

170
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,220
just went there for a meal.

171
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,730
Even if they are close,

172
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,030
it can't compare to your connection.

173
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,880
Your Highness, you're drunk.

174
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,650
I've made some tea for you.

175
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,340
Aren't you close to Yin Zheng's concubine?

176
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,059
Go to the Nine Regions Food Collection for me.

177
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,600
There must be something wrong with them.

178
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,630
When you find out,

179
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,330
come back and tell me.

180
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,450
They all know

181
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,840
you've taken my whole heart.

182
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,880
I guess I can't get anything useful.

183
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,560
Do you know what you're talking about?

184
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,180
Do you know what you're talking about?

185
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,340
Do you know what you're talking about?

186
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,280
Your Highness.

187
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,940
I don't care if you

188
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,680
deceived me and pleased me with those sweet talk.

189
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm not bothered by you.

190
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,930
You said I had all your heart, right?

191
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,350
Prove it to me, understand?

192
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,190
Your Highness.

193
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,650
Aren't you talking with the Tenth Prince right now?

194
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,540
Right, um...

195
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,720
Shut up!

196
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,970
I'm telling you.

197
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,460
No one can disobey me.

198
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,240
No one.

199
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,000
Right, I have a blind date.

200
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,110
I have to go.

201
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,130
Get up.

202
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,940
The food is here.

203
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,810
Hao Jia.

204
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,150
Come on, try it.

205
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,330
This is the special horseshoe cake of Yanchuan.

206
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,310
See if it's authentic.

207
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,450
Thank you.

208
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,990
Don't mention it.

209
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,020
It looks delicious.

210
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,410
Here, try it.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,650
It's smooth.

212
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,110
Come on.

213
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,920
Try it.

214
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,880
Thank you so much.

215
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,410
You didn't even avoid me.

216
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,340
Actually, I'm here today

217
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,900
because Prince Song

218
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,450
wanted me to find fault with

219
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,810
your business.

220
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,220
I'm really sorry.

221
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,970
What's wrong with that?

222
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,290
Don't think too much about it.

223
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,220
Just tell him.

224
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,700
That's right.

225
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,400
You can hardly come out.

226
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,820
He can't get his way.

227
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,720
Instead, we finally see you.

228
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,360
That's right.

229
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,270
Don't be afraid.

230
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,000
Since we dare to do this open,

231
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,100
we've already planned to deal with all this.

232
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,090
That's true.

233
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,990
The store across the street has been taken over.

234
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
They're going to make a restaurant too

235
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,000
and do a face-to-face fight with us.

236
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,070
We're not even afraid.

237
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,370
Although the restaurant is still losing money,

238
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,480
I think

239
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,910
as long as we can cope with all this,

240
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,020
we should be able to turn the situation around

241
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,430
after half a year.

242
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,840
That's long.

243
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,830
Face it.

244
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,920
It's rare to make a restaurant

245
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,280
profitable so soon.

246
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,200
Ms. Yuan Ying.

247
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,220
We've agreed

248
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,870
not to talk about business while we're eating.

249
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,810
Did you forget it?

250
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,910
I see.

251
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,640
By the way,

252
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,890
Prince Song knows that Prince Zheng

253
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,560
is hosting banquets for the ambassadors of all the regions here.

254
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,450
I'm afraid that when the time is right,

255
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,120
he'll use this as an excuse.

256
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,680
Since Yin Zheng wants to do this,

257
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,130
he will be criticized by others.

258
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,310
We can't stop just because of others' gossip.

259
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,350
Thank you for telling us.

260
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,270
Hao Jia.

261
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,070
Come on.

262
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,710
Fried rice cake with pike and crab is also Yanchuan specialty.

263
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,830
Although it's delicious,

264
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,250
the crab is cold-natured.

265
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,680
You can't have much of it.

266
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,950
Got it.

267
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,950
Just this once,

268
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,230
let's satisfy Hao Jia.

269
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,550
You guys are amazing.

270
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,660
You can run such a large restaurant

271
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,660
in a short period.

272
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,500
I'm useless.

273
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,480
I can't help anything.

274
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,530
What useless?

275
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,770
What bullshit is that?

276
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,130
Hao Jia.

277
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,590
It seems something is wrong.

278
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,810
If you have a problem,

279
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,680
tell us.

280
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,090
We'll solve it together.

281
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,960
You are more like family

282
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,150
to me.

283
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,910
Hao Jia.

284
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,030
Does Prince Song maltreat you?

285
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,490
How does he treat you?

286
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,240
Tell us.

287
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,070
We'll help you.

288
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,380
Just say it.

289
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,000
It's okay.

290
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,860
I just feel

291
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,130
I'm useless.

292
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,090
I used to hang my hope

293
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,930
on a man.

294
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,380
I thought I was so smart.

295
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,380
I deserve this.

296
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,640
Don't mind me.

297
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,700
I must be spoiling the fun.

298
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,100
Let's eat.

299
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,670
Come on.

300
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,210
What's wrong?

301
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:35,850
Nothing.

302
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:36,880
Give me that.

303
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,330
Did he beat you up?

304
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,120
Bastard!

305
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,830
Your Highness.

306
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,130
He didn't hit me.

307
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,580
He just pushed me.

308
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,730
Push? How?

309
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,230
Not the slightest of maltreatment is bearable.

310
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,690
That's right!

311
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,290
Yeah, right.

312
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,330
He picks on you.

313
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,340
It's nothing.

314
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,720
I still have to depend on him.

315
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,970
You can't fight for me in the mansion

316
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,980
every time something happens.

317
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,870
And I can't drag you guys into it.

318
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,830
Hao Jia.

319
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,950
Why don't you run away

320
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,560
like us?

321
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,490
I...

322
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,930
Can I?

323
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,910
It's not common for concubines to run away.

324
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,290
But there are examples.

325
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,100
Men won't report to the police because they want to save face,

326
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,020
just like what Prince An did.

327
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,220
But

328
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,340
the solar term girls are not on the register of the Ministry of Rites.

329
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,980
Hao Jia…

330
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,840
Prince An won't report to the government because he's ashamed.

331
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,320
Prince Song can only be worse than him.

332
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,180
Hao Jia.

333
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,840
Run.

334
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,920
Run to Jichuan.

335
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,900
Our families have a good relationship.

336
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,450
My father will try to protect you.

337
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,340
I can't.

338
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,360
All the responsibility

339
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,530
will fall on you.

340
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,650
What's wrong with that?

341
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,130
Do you want me to see you live like this?

342
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,430
As long as you are willing to fight for your life,

343
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,880
Danchuan will take the responsibility for you.

344
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,480
I've had enough of that.

345
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,710
I don't want to live like that anymore.

346
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,380
How about this?

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,770
You can live in the restaurant

348
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,380
later.

349
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,660
Don't you know how to make flower tea and flower dew?

350
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,430
You can also make rouge from flower juice.

351
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,030
When the restaurant gets better,

352
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,430
you can sell it here.

353
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,040
Surely you will make a lot of money.

354
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,410
You can support yourself.

355
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,260
Hao Jia.

356
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,050
This is the route map I drew for you.

357
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,830
Whether it's Jinchuan,

358
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,870
Danchuan,

359
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,930
or Jichuan,

360
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,410
you'll be taken in

361
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,900
in any of the mentioned places.

362
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,590
You will not be left alone

363
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,480
against Prince Song.

364
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,130
Oh my god.

365
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,360
Thank you.

366
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,430
Thank you so much.

367
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,360
Don't worry.

368
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,550
We are here.

369
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,690
Don't be afraid.

370
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,410
Humans have strong resilience.

371
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,860
As long as you are willing to forget the past,

372
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,420
you can always do it.

373
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,080
What's wrong?

374
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,150
Is there something wrong with the food today?

375
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,700
I ate a lot of it.

376
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,260
I don't think there's anything wrong.

377
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,050
Hao Jia.

378
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,610
Did you

379
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,850
have something bad?

380
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,290
No.

381
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,270
Hao Jia.

382
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,610
Are you…

383
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,170
[Garden of Triumph]

384
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,610
Congratulations, Your Highness.

385
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,200
Your Ladyship is pregnant.

386
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
It's been more than two months.

387
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,250
Do you mean she's pregnant?

388
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,069
Yes.

389
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,119
Can you find out

390
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,569
whether the baby is a boy or a girl?

391
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,589
Well.

392
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,960
I can't.

393
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,910
Thank you, Doctor.

394
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,780
Yes.

395
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,860
I only have two daughters from concubines in these years.

396
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,610
If you can give birth to a boy,

397
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,520
he will be the eldest son of the family.

398
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,610
I will reward you.

399
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,900
Fangru.

400
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,920
Go to the Temple of the Gods in the north

401
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,050
and invite the divine woman Zhang here.

402
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,690
She has experience in judging the sex of a fetus.

403
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,750
Your Highness.

404
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,050
I think whether it's a boy or a girl,

405
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,240
it's a blessing from heaven. We don't have to…

406
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,900
Enough.

407
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,340
Do as I say.

408
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,970
You must rest well.

409
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,660
I'll see you in a few days.

410
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,930
Go now.

411
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,320
Don't worry, Your Ladyship.

412
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,480
Your Ladyship.

413
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,560
How is it?

414
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,700
Prince Song is keeping it a secret.

415
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,840
They won't say anything.

416
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,850
But according to my experience

417
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,530
of asking around,

418
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,940
no news means it's true.

419
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,520
That means...

420
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,890
Hao Jia is really pregnant.

421
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,010
Definitely.

422
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,170
Tonic from the Ministry of Internal Affairs

423
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,650
is being delivered like water to Prince Song's mansion.

424
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,120
The Imperial Doctor is being secretive.

425
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,470
Perhaps the fetus is still unstable before the third month.

426
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,590
That's why they can't say anything yet.

427
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,930
It's a good thing for women to be pregnant.

428
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,070
Your Ladyship should be happy for her.

429
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,640
It's good to have a child.

430
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,680
It's just that this baby came at a bad time.

431
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,750
I'm a little worried about Hao Jia.

432
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,770
Prince Song

433
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,420
will keep a closer eye on her.

434
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,070
I won't be able to see her for a long time again.

435
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,750
I heard

436
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,020
a new restaurant has opened in the capital.

437
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,040
It's called Nine Regions Food Collection.

438
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,080
I haven't said anything yet.

439
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,370
Why are you kneeling?

440
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,260
I am guilty.

441
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,230
I'm willing to be punished.

442
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,430
So do I.

443
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,020
Women are not allowed to go in public in Xinchuan.

444
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
But Xinchuan has no rules

445
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,510
that forbid them from doing business.

446
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,050
Father.

447
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,320
In my wife's hometown,

448
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,570
women are allowed to go into business.

449
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,730
They

450
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,590
are doing this because they hope

451
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,350
people can have their hometown food in Xinchuan

452
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,600
to relieve the homesickness.

453
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,620
That's sincere.

454
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,650
I was so touched when I heard that.

455
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,990
I thought

456
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,640
I should give them a chance.

457
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,440
Since so,

458
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,570
just put in the money.

459
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,620
They don't have to do it.

460
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,340
The Prince's wife is out and about.

461
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,050
What a disgrace!

462
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,550
Father.

463
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,250
[Danchuan Women's Biography]

464
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,410
In fact, Danchuan's idea is

465
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,070
women can do whatever men do.

466
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,900
Moreover, the prosperity of Danchuan is related to

467
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,110
Lord Danchuan's faith in women.

468
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,460
I think the restaurant

469
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,430
shows inclusion.

470
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,180
Besides,

471
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,710
if they only invest money but don't run the restaurant,

472
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,030
it's not fair to the other proprietors either.

473
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,480
This must be the idea of the two princesses of Jinchuan and Danchuan, right?

474
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,600
Get up.

475
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,420
Finish this with me.

476
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,420
- Yes. -Yes.

477
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,200
Your Majesty.

478
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,130
The Princes' wives have opened a restaurant outside.

479
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,220
Did you know that?

480
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,910
It seems you already knew about it.

481
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,440
I've just heard about it.

482
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,990
What do you think?

483
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,950
I thought

484
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,350
it's not a violation of the law

485
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,730
for them to do this.

486
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,960
We still need to see

487
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,150
whether it's out of line or not.

488
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,560
If there is nothing wrong with it,

489
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,760
we can take it as a good story.

490
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,260
We don't discriminate between men and women; we only look at their abilities.

491
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,770
It's also good for Xinchuan.

492
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,040
Do you know

493
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,750
Zheng is hosting banquets for foreign envoys

494
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,560
to discuss business there?

495
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,640
I haven't heard of this.

496
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,600
But I thought

497
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,400
Yin Zheng would never dare to overstep his bounds.

498
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,270
He works in the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

499
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,010
He has to deal with foreign regions.

500
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,410
The restaurant is unique.

501
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,710
Foreign envoys do like to go there.

502
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,710
If the foreign envoys can get loose there,

503
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,420
maybe things would go more smoothly.

504
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,110
Father ordered me

505
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,180
to keep an eye on Yin Zheng.

506
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,780
Any problem being found,

507
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,760
we'll take over the Nine Regions Food Collection.

508
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,440
Why don't you say something?

509
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,840
I'm not feeling well for pregnancy.

510
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,040
If you don't feel well, call the doctor.

511
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,590
Lv Ming.

512
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
This is your breach of duty.

513
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,310
Your Highness.

514
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,690
I'm fine.

515
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,790
It's normal to have some discomfort during pregnancy.

516
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,610
You must be careful.

517
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,590
The thing in your belly

518
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,140
is my eldest son.

519
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,220
He'll be the firstborn in name only

520
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,830
once I let my wife raise him.

521
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,000
Are you giving my child

522
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,930
to other people?

523
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,140
Don't worry.

524
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,650
It won't be Zhao Fangru.

525
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
She's too sharp.

526
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,160
I didn't like her from the start.

527
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,960
I'll find a lovely wife

528
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,040
and make her raise our son.

529
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,240
Throw away all this powder.

530
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,750
It's not good for the child.

531
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,020
Your Highness.

532
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,100
I made these myself with flower dew.

533
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,590
I've asked the doctor.

534
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,980
It's not harmful to the fetus.

535
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,580
Besides, I just

536
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,260
don't want to look bad.

537
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,140
You look beautiful even without these.

538
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,250
Lv Ming.

539
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,260
Throw them all away.

540
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,370
Yes.

541
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:36,890
Bao.

542
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,470
Yes.

543
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,560
Bring in the tonic

544
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,620
for Her Ladyship.

545
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,790
Yes, Your Highness.

546
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,370
You don't look well because you don't eat.

547
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,080
I've told you before.

548
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,400
You should eat cubilose three times a day.

549
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,550
I feel disgusted.

550
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,910
I can't eat it.

551
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,680
Eat it after you throw up then.

552
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,300
Even if you don't like it,

553
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,280
my son has to eat it.

554
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,700
Madam.

555
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,930
I've brought the message to Prince Zheng.

556
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,000
His Majesty is not happy that the emissary is eating at the restaurant.

557
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,520
It's so out of blue.

558
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,800
Someone must have said something.

559
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,780
Okay.

560
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,920
I see.

561
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,440
Please forgive me for talking too much.

562
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,300
I couldn't resist telling Prince Zheng

563
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,260
that you spoke for him.

564
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,750
What did he say?

565
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,950
Prince Zheng

566
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,490
said thank you.

567
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,320
He was very grateful.

568
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,690
Mother.

569
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,920
I want some candy.

570
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,840
Your father said you can only have one.

571
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,490
Otherwise, you'll have tooth decay.

572
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,310
That's how a son acts.

573
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,900
He won't thank his mother for the candy.

574
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,430
If Madam were closer to Prince Zheng,

575
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,940
he wouldn't thank you anymore.

576
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,630
After all,

577
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,740
it's because of me that we're so distant from each other.

578
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,370
Mother.

579
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,780
Why don't you be more direct?

580
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,670
Just say what you have to say.

581
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,250
Adults are so stupid.

582
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,260
You smart boy.

583
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,410
By the way,

584
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,810
I saw the second and third Princes talking

585
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,270
when I was outside Zhongyi Hall.

586
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,790
I think they were planning

587
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,050
to use Nine Regions Food Collection as an excuse.

588
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,550
Prince An and he is getting close.

589
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,180
Are they…

590
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,230
The brothers in the palace...

591
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:35,100

Don't miss it.

600
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,090
This is a clear steal of business.

601

Come on in.

602
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,320
This bastard.

603
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,000
He has been quiet in the past few days.

604
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,960
I thought he'd moved on.

605
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,430
I never thought he'd do this.

606
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,490
Is he the reincarnation of a cannonball?

607
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,130
Why isn't he scared?

608
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,700
What?

609
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,840
He's not scared.

610
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,360
I'm going to confront him.

611
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,160
Oh my God.

612
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,500
Save your breath.

613
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,460
We have a big fight tomorrow.

614
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,090
Yeah, right.

615
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,800
He's going to have to do it again tomorrow.

616
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,840
If they come to the door,

617
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,680
ignore him.

618
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,000
Just follow my plan.

619
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,510
Sir.

620
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,230
Enjoy your stay.

621
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,760
Please come inside.

622
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,310
Attention everyone.

623
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,100
Nine Regions Food Big Collection

624
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,460
across is looking for shopkeepers.

625
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,300
No matter how much you are paid here per month,

626
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,800
I'll raise it by 10%.

627
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,250
You don't like it, do you?

628
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,050
Okay.

629
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,510
I'll raise it by 20%.

630
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,630
You're not going?

631
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,270
What is it?

632
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,620
Raise it

633
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,870
by 30%.

634
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,360
30%.

635
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,430
How about this?

636
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,770
As long as you don't work here,

637
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,120
I'll pay you back,

638
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,640
as much as you want.

639
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,480
Don't embarrass yourself.

640
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,540
You can't take them away from us.

641
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,800
I can tell you.

642
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,410
They all have shifts.

643
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,210
Night duty is also paid separately.

644
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,720
It's a benefit that no one else can order.

645
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,150
What's more,

646
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,970
this is a woman-owned restaurant.

647
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,210
If we don't do well,

648
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,470
we will become a laughingstock.

649
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,060
So we have to succeed.

650
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,970
No failure is expected.

651
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,280
This is more of a guarantee for them.

652
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,920
And it's just a whim for you

653
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,130
to open a restaurant.

654
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,440
And you want to follow our example.

655
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,550
Only a fool would give up his job here.

656
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,620
I opened the restaurant so that you would become a laughingstock,

657
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,770
so that you'll know how hard it is out there.

658
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,620
You'll know how good I am.

659
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,140
You're acting like a child.

660
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,780
You've made so many foolish moves.

661
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,300
You think it's easy to open a restaurant?

662
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,880
How many years have I been in business?

663
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,500
How many years have you been in business?

664
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,870
How much more do you know than I do?

665
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,880
Yes.

666
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,780
You've been in business for a longer time.

667
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,200
So what?

668
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,300
If you were calmer,

669
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,170
you wouldn't be here doing

670
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,950
such a ridiculous and time-consuming thing.

671
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,050
You're just mad at us for leaving you.

672
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,210
You're not half as angry as we were.

673
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,840
You're not a villain.

674
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,120
But the years we were with you

675
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,730
was the toughest.

676
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,590
Stop it!

677
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,080
How dare you judge me?

678
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,870
You are sorry for me.

679
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,040
All these years,

680
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,960
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

681
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,270
Where does the blind confidence of yours

682
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,090
come from?

683
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,760
Just wait.

684
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,980
You will lose badly.

685
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,490
Very badly.

686
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,010

Nine Regions Food Big Collection big discount.

699
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,530
A bigger discount.

700
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,280
No matter how much their dish costs,

701
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,320
I'm half as cheap as they are.

702
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,700
Look at him, Haitang.

703
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,700
You're giving up now?

704
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,450
Wait for it.

705
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,110
They're all coming to my place.

706
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,160
Just wait.

707
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,020
Please come in.

708
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,970
Sir, don't leave.

709
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,230
It's cheaper than yours there.

710
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,430
Yuan Ying.

711
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,830
The customers have gone over there.

712
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,520
No problem.

713
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,830
Prince An is now pricing the dishes

714
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,050
far below the cost price.

715
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,219
He'll either lose money

716
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,020
or adjust the cost downwards.

717
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,690
The former is unsustainable.

718
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,219
The latter does not guarantee the taste.

719
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,440
So we're going to bring the food back to the original price?

720
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,389
No.

721
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,590
Li Wei has drafted a new menu.

722
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,270
[Menu]

723
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,340
After we try it out,

724
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,570
we'll decide on a new plan

725
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,800
and be one step ahead of Prince An.

726
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,219
I'll teach him

727
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,850
a lesson this time.

728
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,429
Customers love the new and loathe the old.

729
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,880
Besides, they don't want to lose out.

730
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,239
If the dishes are the same as before

731
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,230
with the same price,

732
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,070
they will feel bored

733
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,260
and lose interest.

734
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,850
If there is a new dish,

735
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,920
and the price is cheaper than before,

736
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,520
they will be interested.

737
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,310
Business is not about making the customer suffer,

738
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,090
but to make them feel that they've got a better end.

739
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,480
That's true.

740
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,240
But this doesn't seem edible.

741
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,840
This is a hybrid of Daichuan and Cangchuan,

742
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,650
baked roll and stinky tofu.

743
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,450
This is a hybrid of Daichuan and Mochuan,

744
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,800
river snails rice noodles with stinky tofu and roasted alcohol.

745
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,050
That is a hybrid of Yingchuan and Jichuan,

746
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,660
mash and brown sugar dumplings.

747
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,900
The dumplings seem to be the only normal dish.

748
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,450
Try it.

749
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,210
Tasty.

750
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,890
Okay, I'll do it.

751
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,550
The taste is really good.

752
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,770
Let me try this.

753
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,300
It's not bad.

754
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,350
Yuan Ying, try it.

755
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,100
No need.

756
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,830
It's a matter of self-control not to eat after dinner.

757
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,210
But in my opinion,

758
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,210
the names of these dishes,

759
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,880
like snail noodles and roasted wine and stinky tofu.

760
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,550
Customers wouldn't want to have it.

761
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,380
Let's try different names.

762
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,770
We must think of good names.

763
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,340
Our restaurant is proud to introduce

764
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,450
hybrid new dishes of all regions.

765
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,880
We invite you to come and taste.

766
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,520
Order in line.

767
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,690
Room Mo No.4.

768
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,400
"Heroes of the world".

769
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,550
Come on, Miss.

770
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,580
I'll have "The mountain and the sea".

771
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,690
Room Xin No. 3.

772
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,970
"The mountain and the sea".

773
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:53,940
Thank you, boss.

774
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,130
Miss.

775
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,770
Give me "Go on and on."

776
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,720
Room Mo No.1. "Go on and on."

777
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,370
Room Yingchuan No.5 table.

778
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,860
[Hybrid dish of Yingchuan and Yanchuan. Cherry braised pork]

779
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,940
"Jade plate with peaches" is ready.

780
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,010
The "Flower dew" is ready for Table Daichuan 3.

781
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,900
[Hybrid dish of Daichuan and Cangchuan, snail noodles, roast wine and stinky tofu]

782
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,660
"Heroes of the world go on and on" of Mochuan No. 2 is ready.

783
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,550
[Hybrid dish of Daichuan and Mochuan, Grilled cold noodles rolled with stinky tofu and salami]

784
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,860
"Mountain and sea, happy and peaceful" for Jinchuan No.1.

785
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,050
[Hybrid dish of Jichuan and Jichuan, fish and shrimp]

786
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,770
Guys.

787
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,850
Don't go.

788
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,750
You guys.

789
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,250
Don't leave.

790
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,660
I'll lower the price, okay?

791
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,780
After you lower the price,

792
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,330
it tastes worse.

793
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,570
This is terrible.

794
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,630
Don't pull my sleeve.

795
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,570
Let go! Let go!

796
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,380
What's this nonsense?

797
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,690
What's with the hybrid dishes?

798
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,440
Do you think you can steal all my customers?

799
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,530
You're just following the trend.

800
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,610
Your restaurant won't be open for long.

801
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,510
You're not my mother.

802
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,570
It's none of your business.

803
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,290
That's enough, Haitang.

804
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,930
Don't talk to him.

805
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,170
He won't understand anything you say.

806
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,660
He'll only take good intentions for granted.

807
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,440
White Dew.

808
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,040
You're White Dew.

809
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,340
I recognize you.

810
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,380
Do you?

811
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,350
You can recognize me.

812
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,280
Isn't that the least you can do to respect me?

813
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,060
I should be thanking you now, shouldn't I?

814
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,310
No.

815
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,570
I memorized your portraits every day.

816
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,710
I tried to be nice to you.

817
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,130
But you turn your back on me.

818
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,320
You treat me like an enemy.

819
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,910
You realize you should chase a duck when it flies.

820
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,210
You realize you should take care of your children when they grow up.

821
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,380
Should I forgive the past now that you're changing?

822
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,840
Why do you hate me so much?

823
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,370
We don't hate you.

824
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,420
We just want to live our own lives.

825
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,350
You're the one who won't let go.

826
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,660
You leave the Ministry of Revenue aside.

827
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,730
All you do is fool around.

828
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,600
Lord Xinchuan is tolerating you

829
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,920
because you lost your mother when you were young.

830
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,190
He raised you and has a deep bond with you.

831
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,700
But people's hearts change.

832
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,410
Even ordinary parents and children

833
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,040
should follow certain rules.

834
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,910
Not to mention that you have so many brothers.

835
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,000
And

836
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,850
the nine-region cuisine business is very complicated.

837
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,890
So many people are watching it.

838
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,690
Don't you know that?

839
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,770
Complicated?

840
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,720
I've been in the business for so many years.

841
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,500
What else can happen that I can't calculate?

842
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,350
Duke Yue is here.

843
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,540
Duke Yue.

844
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,790
Duke Yue.

845
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,450
Duke Yue.

846
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,120
Madam Xinchuan's brother,

847
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,370
who was made Duke of Wanxiang in his early years.

848
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,470
On the ground.

849
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,170
Duke Yue.

850
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,880
What brings you here?

851
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,120
[Duke of Wanxiang from Ministry of Revenue, Yue Heng]

852
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,040
An's here, too.

853
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,480
Just in time.

854
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,840
Issue the order.

855
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,960
A royal decree from the Ministry of Revenue,

856
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,790
the competition of Nine Regions Food Collection

857
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,280
and Nine Regions Food Big Collection

858
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,600
have interrupted the market.

859
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,530
The emissaries of the Nine Regions come and go.

860
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,330
It harms morality.

861
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,010
Therefore,

862
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,950
both of the restaurants will be transferred to the Ministry of Revenue,

863
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,210
in the charge of Duke of Wanxiang.

864
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,690
You're not allowed to take charge of all matters.

865
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,310
Women have never opened a restaurant

866
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,920
in Xinchuan since ancient times.

867
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,930
What's more,

868
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,610
I've heard of emissaries from the Nine Regions coming and going.

869
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,780
This is not a good idea.

870
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,010
In the long term,

871
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,140
I'll manage it on behalf of His Majesty and Prince Song.

872
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,310
From now on,

873
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,560
you and the restaurant across the street

874
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,980
should close for renovation.

875
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,310
Duke Yue.

876
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,590
We've been paying taxes to the Ministry of Revenue as required.

877
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,460
If we close down,

878
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,770
I'm afraid it would be detrimental to the Ministry of Revenue.

879
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,020
Don't worry about this, Princess Jinchuan.

880
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,960
I have my plans.

881
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:05,960
From now on,

882
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,090
you'll still be the proprietor of the restaurant.

883
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,710
But I

884
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,490
am the proprietor of the proprietor.

885
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:24,140
Take the ladies to copy

886
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,350
the list of ambassadors who recently came to the restaurant.

887
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,150
Yes, sir.

888
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,610
You.

889
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,990
Follow me downstairs to find An.

890
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,710
An.

891
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,490
It's said that husband and wife share joy and sorrow.

892
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,920
You were competing with women in the street.

893
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,800
There's a pile of impeachment papers in the Ministry of Revenue.

894
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,390
Prince Song thinks you're fooling around.

895
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
I'll have to intervene.

896
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,490
They say that women shouldn't be allowed to go in public.

897
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,780
Fortunately, these women are sensible enough

898
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,760
not to disclose their identities.

899
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,370
Only a few people know.

900
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,840
Ms. Tong is your wife.

901
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,350
Otherwise, what further trouble will you make?

902
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,120
Dong.

903
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,030
You know?

904
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,130
You know nothing.

905
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,500
No.

906
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,310
My wife's name is Dong.

907
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,490
Potato, potato.

908
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,260
Back to the main story,

909
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,530
in the past few days,

910
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,160
the Ministry of Revenue has checked.

911
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,540
Now I'll summarize the restaurant's business situation

912
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,820
and sort out where it's heading,

913
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,660
so that it can build on the past and create new glories.

914
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,520
Why does it sound familiar?

915
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,960
Through the smoke and clouds of blood and fire,

916
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,490
recall the vicissitudes of the past.

917
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,420
You're indeed families.

918
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,440
Since the restaurant is located in Xinchuan,

919
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,990
we should focus on the taste of the local people

920
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,210
rather than just trying to please

921
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,770
a few foreigners.

922
00:42:59,110 --> 00:42:59,690
Of course.

923
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,150
You are women.

924
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,620
You don't understand why.

925
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,210
That's why we should use better decision-makers.

926
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,500
I can't believe someone is more annoying than An.

927
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,390
Don't go near this old man.

928
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,430
You will become unfortunate.

929
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,180
Anyway,

930
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,220
you have to have a higher vision

931
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,550
and a bigger picture

932
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,970
towards a newer and better future.

933
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,060
I see.

934
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,550
He just wants to drive us away by disgusting us,

935
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,660
so that he and Yin Song can take over this place.

936
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,780
You're talking?

937
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,600
How did you hear that?

938
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,430
As I said,

939
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,910
don't solicit

940
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,650
foreigners anymore.

941
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,320
Put Xinchuan first.

942
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:43,980
Uncle.

943
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,430
Now that you've taken everyone on board.

944
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,150
We're family now.

945
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,610
I want to take a long-term view.

946
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,610
This is Nine Regions Food Collection.

947
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:54,770
If we don't focus on the nine regions,

948
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:55,940
- we'll be... - An.

949
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,570
You're confined in vision.

950
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,450
I've been in the Ministry of Revenue for many years.

951
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,830
I know how to run a restaurant.

952
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,230
We have to put the big picture first.

953
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,610
You're too young.

954
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:09,830
Come on.

955
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,600
Let me teach you.

956
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,280
To run a restaurant

957
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,280
is all about attracting customers.

958
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,590
You need to know what their tastes are,

959
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,600
and what they like.

960
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,360
Digest it.

961
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,490
What did he say to you?

962
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,070
What exactly did Yue tell you?

963
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,980
I know I was wrong.

964
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,930
I'm sorry for you.

965
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,430
I finally realized how annoying I used to be.

966
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,350
I was too annoying.

967
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,230
I won't be so chatty anymore.

968
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,280
♫What's the finest delicacy in the world?♫

969
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:34,360
♫Heating up a pot of tea and feeling the time pass by silently♫

970
