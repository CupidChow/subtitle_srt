00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,990
the people from Xinchuan have entered the palace.

8
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,600

[Madam Danchuan: Shangguan Yan]

10
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,140
If my sister doesn't want to go back, she doesn't need to do that.

11
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,310
Sister.

12
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,170
But the situation is serious now.

13
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,230
Lord Xinchuan sent his two sons here.

14
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,500
If I don't go back,

15
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,450
I will put you in danger.

16
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,640
Peace alliance of the nine regions?

17
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,460
It means sacrificing women to maintain a relationship.

18
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,590
I've made up my mind.

19
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,890
Three years later, Danchuan women won't participate in the selection.

20
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,270
I can protect them, and I can protect you, too.

21

Sister.

22
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,040
Danchuan has been flooded many times.

23
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,579
No matter how immature I am,

24
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,220
I know that we need Xinchuan's help now.

Three years?

26
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,730
It's too long.

27
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,200
We can't fight against Xinchuan now.

28
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,500
No matter how weak Danchuan is,

29
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,900
there's still the strongest Navy in the nine regions.

30
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,530
No matter what, Xinchuan has to be cautious.

31
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,490
Don't worry about that.

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,000
Just ask yourself if you're willing or not.

33
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,880
If you don't,

34
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,530
I can protect you

35

Where should I sit?

37
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,670
You can't let me sit there.

38
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,490
That should be your lady's seat.

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,340
Well.

40
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,330
I...

41
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,170
I can't stand here.

42
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,710
I don't even deserve a seat, right?

43
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,870

45
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,860
You've come a long way. Don't stand on ceremony.

46

Have a seat.

47
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,070

Please.

52
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
But, theirs are two-flavor hot pot.

53
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,370
Why is mine this?

54
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,540
You are the son-in-law of Danchuan.

55
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,190
Of course you should follow the customs there.

56
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,240
I specially ordered someone to prepare Spicy Hot Pot, which is Jing's favorite.

Please have a taste.

58
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,280
These dishes just look scary,

59
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,220
but they are actually quite delicious.

60
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,260
Maybe Madam Danchuan wants to test the Prince Qi.

61
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,550
Don't worry.

62
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,340
The first one, fish eye

63
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,590
is most suitable for those who are blind.

64
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,080
This is...

65
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,600
It's not bad.

66
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,130
The second one, Huanghou

67
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,130
is the cardiac tube of the cow.

68
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,490
In Danchuan, people who are dishonest are like this cow.

69
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,330
I think these dishes suit your taste.

70
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,450
Offer the last dish.

71
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,950
What is this?

72
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,700
This is the pig brain.

73
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,630
If the son-in-law of Danchuann mistreats his wife,

74
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,560
we wouldn't mind eating his brain.

75
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,810
Since Madam Danchuan asked us to come back to wait for news,

76
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,750
don't worry.

77
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,570
I'll sleep on the couch tonight.

78
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,460
You are the boss.

79
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,060
There's no reason to let you sleep on the couch.

80
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,730
I don't think anyone sleeps in the same room with his book.

81
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,420
It's because the Prince Qi is here.

82
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,700
It's better for us to sleep in the same room.

83
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,100
It'll be bad if they know we are fake couple.

84
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,360
All right.

85
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Let me sleep here.

86
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,570
Let me sleep here.

87
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,170
You have to go to the palace tomorrow.

88
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,950
It seems that it is not easy to deal with Madam Danchuan.

89
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,080
You have to take a lot of trouble.

90
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,010
Have a good rest.

91
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,020
Danchuan is the only place in the nine regions that has a night market.

93
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,560

That's too much.

Exactly.

148
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,380
As a matrilocal husband,

149
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,510
it's a shame to let your wife peel an orange.

150
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,690
You understood. He is not...

Learn from him.

156
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Watch carefully.

164
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,840
This is so delicate.

165
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,820
Do you like it?

166
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,700
Your wife obviously likes it.

167
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,130
Learn it quickly.

168
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:38,940
Yes.

169
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,490
These are the basic skills.

170
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,430
How did you get a wife

171
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,630
if you can't do these?

172
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,070
I've been in Danchuan for so long,

173
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,350
but I've never seen such a bad matrilocal husband like you.

174
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,110
Really.

175
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,730
You know nothing about how to be a matrilocal husband.

176
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,260
Peel an apple for your wife.

177
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
Don't you understand?

178
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,070
Everyone,

179
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,810
thank you for teaching my matrilocal husband.

180
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,060
We have to go now.

181
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,160
Let's go.

182
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,470
Your Highness.

183
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,490
I overstepped my boundary just now.

184
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,890
I shouldn't call you a matrilocal husband.

185
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,380
Please forgive me.

186
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,210
Although they speak harshly,

187
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,990
they really love their wives.

188
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,860
If people love each other,

189
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,340
it's not bad to be a matrilocal husband.

190
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,350
If they don't love each other,

191
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,350
even if it's an imperial order,

192
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,750
it's hard to compromise.

193
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,320
It's the fast mask-changing in Danchuan Opera!

194
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:20,230
♫The south wind meets the clouds and the moonlight calls the candle♫

195
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:28,050
♫As far as the eye can see, it's just a regular sight♫

196
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,530
♫Why am I being absent-minded? And why am I hesitating?♫

197
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,560
♫I'm worried that you'll see through my mind by my eyes♫

198
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,480
♫My words are not surprising. Nor is my language inaccurate♫

199
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,410
♫I've got some affection towards you♫

200
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,190
♫I don't speak in an excessive way. Nor do I express my feelings♫

201
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,990
♫Who should I tell about the one I love?♫

202
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,090
♫By now, my words have turned into wind, and my missing of you has melted into fog♫

203
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,850
♫I wrote about the past into a letter♫

204
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,510
♫If you and I know each other well, there's no need to write more♫

205
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,380
♫My mind runs wild, and I don't where is the way to go back♫

206
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,080
♫I love you deeply and there's nothing else I ask for♫

207
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,960
♫I only wish the two of us could love each other as one soul, eat three meals together and spend the four seasons together♫

208
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,560
Excuse me.

209
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:35,770
Zheng.

210
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,660
You're still acting tough in a terrible health condition.

211
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,760
Is this the fast mask-changing that Shangguan Jing mentioned?

212
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,690
It's so lively.

213
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,600
I'll watch it in the front.

214
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,670
Where are you going?

215
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,330
Great!

216
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,680
The order of Madam Danchuan:

217
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,290
Ying Qi, the son-in-law of Danchuan,

218
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,260
is filthy,

219
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,390
and unforgivable

220
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,520
with a sharp tongue.

221
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,320
He must pass the exam for husbands,

222
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,960
and then he can see the princess.

223
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,090
Please enter the palace immediately.

224
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,940
Lady-in-waiting,

225
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,230
what is the exam for a husband?

226
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,320
What is it?

227
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,010
It includes husband's appearance,

228
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,010
husband's words,

229
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,310
husband's virtues,

230
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,570
and husband's skills,

231
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,640
aiming to test the moral integrity of a man.

232
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,380
Husband's appearance

233
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,510
means appearance.

234
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,190
Prince Qi is obviously not good enough in this aspect.

235
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,450
And he disappointed us in the husband's words and virtues.

236
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,270
Now he can win a round just in the husband's skills.

237
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,930
The first thing is winning in the Mahjong.

238
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,200
If a man from Danchuan can't win in the Mahjong,

239
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,510
he's not a capable man.

240
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,610
Prince Qi,

241
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,120
please.

242
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,730
Self-drawn!

243
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,600
I win!

244
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,900
I win!

245
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,510
I win!

246
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,670
I win!

247
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,860
I win!

248
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,640
I win!

249
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,930
Three Characters.

250
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,440
Pong.

251
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,840
No.

252
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,240
I made a mistake.

253
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,700
He regretted his choice, reflecting that he has bad qualities when playing Mahjong.

254
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,700
Three Dots.

255
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,150
Kong.

256
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,859
He is not good at calculating the numbers of cards, reflecting that he is not smart.

257
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,520
Eight Dots.

258
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,569
Do you want it?

259
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,099
Stop dawdling.

260
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,760
One Bamboo.

261
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,520
Are you sure?

262
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,740
Let me think.

263
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,490
Let me see.

264
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,630
He discarded, reflecting he that he has bad characters.

265
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,630
He is hesitate, reflecting that he is narrow-minded.

266
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,710
You can't make it.

267
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,540
You can win by seven pairs.

268
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,520
They are cheating.

269
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,790
Will it work?

270
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,500
One Character.

271
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,490
One Character.

272
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,130
Eighty Characters.

273
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Four Dots.

274
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Nine Characters.

275
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,040
Five Characters.

276
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Five Characters.

277
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Nine Characters.

278
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,210
Three Bamboos.

279
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,080
One Dot.

280
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,240
Seven Dots.

281
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,900
Seven Dots.

282
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Five Dots.

283
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,880
Three Bamboos.

284
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,040
Four Dots.

285
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,640
Seven Dots.

286
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,300
Seven Dots.

287
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,060
Eight Bamboos.

288
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,920
Seven Bamboos.

289
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,280
Three Bamboos.

290
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,840
Nine Characters.

291
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,630
One Character.

292
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,430
Five Bamboos.

293
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,230
Four Dots.

294
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,630
One Bamboo.

295
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,170
I know.

296
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:32,910
Nine Dots.

297
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,730
I win.

298
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,320
Seven pairs.

299
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,950
I win!

300
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:42,850
All of you have to give me chips.

301
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,970
Hurry up.

302
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,920
Give me the chips.

303
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,720
All of you!

304
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,530
I finally see the money coming back.

305
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,910
Is he the sixth Prince, Yin Zheng?

306
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,320
Yes.

307
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,030
It's a necessary skill

308
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,290
for matrilocal husbands of Danchuan to take care of their wives.

309
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,880
Ear cleaning is an important skill to serve their wife.

310
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,170
Hang in there, Su.

311
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,810
Su Shen!

312
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,200
Su.

313
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,310
Butler Su!

314
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,180
Prince Zheng is calling you.

315
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,980
If you like it,

316
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,550
you can come to Danchuan to enjoy it.

317
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,550
What did you say?

318
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,480
Your monthly salary is gone.

319
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,540
He's not good at it.

320
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,120
Right.

321
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,440
Be careful, the Prince Qi.

322
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,980
I was hurt when someone cleaned my ears.

323
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,560
So I beat him to death for half a year.

324
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,510
How come?

325
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,090
Your Highness,

326
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,300
you should make chili oil with them

327
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,770
and let the Princess choose randomly.

328
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,070
If she chooses yours,

329
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,670
you can meet her.

330
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,860
How is that possible?

331
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,590
I have tracheal inflammation.

332
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,320
I almost coughed out my lungs while cooking chili last time.

333
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,070
You're making things difficult for me.

334
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,690
In the name of the alliance,

335
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,310
you marry the Princess but treat her bad.

336
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,730
You are making things difficult for us.

337
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,170
It's our fault.

338
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,270
We accept it.

339
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,760
We accept it.

340
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:28,570
Fine.

341
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,210
As long as Madam Danchuan can calm down,

342
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,020
I accept it.

343
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,690
All you're thinking is to calm Madam down.

344
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,930
You really don't understand.

345
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,360
What does this mean?

346
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:54,880
Hurry up.

347
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,800
They're all gone.

348
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,270
Hurry up.

349
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,950
I see.

350
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,170
The lady-in-waiting just said we didn't understand

351
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,080
because we only wanted to finish the task

352
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,300
in the beginning

353
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,950
to please Madam Danchuan.

354
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,890
But the reason why we came here

355
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,570
is to change Jing's mind.

356
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,390
Prince Qi,

357
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,540
think about it.

358
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,210
Although you don't like Danchuan,

359
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,620
this is Jing's home.

360
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,970
Women are the most respected here.

361
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,100
She lived a carefree life in Danchuan.

362
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,920
But she's lonely in Xinchuan.

363
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,460
You're the only one she gets along with every day.

364
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,450
But you treated her well just to get a concubine.

365
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,350
She must be sad.

366
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,950
Actually, they're not trying to torture you.

367
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,880
They just want to tell you how women of Danchuan live.

368
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,230
Think about it.

369
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,540
You feel uncomfortable here.

370
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,400
Shangguan Jing is also uncomfortable in Xinchuan.

371
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,400
Please have a taste of these five chili oil.

372
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,380
Spicy stuffing.

373
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,460
Since you know which one is made by him,

374
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,300
it also means you don't have to choose that one.

375
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,380
The order of Madam Danchuan:

376
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,890
Although I said

377
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,320
if the Princess recognized the chili oil made by Prince Qi of Xinchuan,

378
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,120
they can meet.

379
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,250
Princess has chosen Prince Qi's.

380
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,590
Prince Qi is not virtuous.

381
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,410
Madam Danchuan has withdrawn her order.

382
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,240
What? You're fooling me.

383
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,820
Prince Qi.

384
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,890
I am just fooling you.

385
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,140
You have had someone in your heart.

386
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
You don't know how to deal with your marriage.

387
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,820
Even on the Mid-Autumn Festival night,

388
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,080
you used every means to fawn on my sister.

389
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,590
She was so happy.

390
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,840
But you were actually fooling her.

391
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,490
Just to get a concubine to fill your emptiness,

392
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,190
how could you fool my sister?

393
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,160
Of course I'll let you have the same feeling.

394
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,620
Madam Danchuan,

395
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,830
this is an order, which will be shown to Lord Xinchuan.

396
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,390
You're being childish.

397
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,450
Are you going to embarrass Xinchuan?

398
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,880
Prince Zheng,

399
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,480
we both know what's going on.

400
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,760
If it goes up to the level of bilateral relationship,

401
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,760
do you think we will be afraid?

402
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,510
Please mind your words.

403
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,620
You've seen

404
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,810
how much Xinchuan care about Danchuan.

405
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,170
But backtracking

406
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,130
is not the right thing for Madam Danchuan to do.

407
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,160
Do you think the King of a region

408
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,760
can sacrifice their own interests for others?

409
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,240
But I'm not like that.

410
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,150
If I can't protect my own people,

411
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,290
I don't deserve to be Madam Danchuan.

412
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,330
So you mean

413
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,390
you want Prince Qi and the Princess

414
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,020
to divorce.

415
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,450
If Prince Qi is not someone who can make my sister happy,

416
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,010
divorce may be good for them.

417
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,110
Ridiculous!

418
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,570
How dare they!

419
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,920
Your Highness!

420
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,100
Calm down!

421
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,490
I can't stop you.

422
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,900
You can't make Prince Zheng fail the mission.

423
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,390
Don't worry.

424
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,670
I won't implicate Zheng.

425
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,000
Tell them I ran away from home.

426
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,080
Ask Lord to arrest me.

427
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,550
Why are you wanted?

428
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,260
Get out!

429
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:24,680
Well.

430
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,400
Move!

431
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,050
Go away!

432
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,120
Prince Qi.

433
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,980
Don't touch me.

434
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,590
Prince Qi,

435
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
you can't just care about yourself.

436
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,280
What about others if you leave?

437
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,180
What about me?

438
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,080
What should I do?

439
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,440
If Madam Danchuan goes on like this,

440
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,570
I can't live.

441
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,060
Prince,

442
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,680
you have to think like this.

443
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,650
If you leave,

444
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,270
there must be a dispute between Xinchuan and Danchuan.

445
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,840
If they don't get along, they might fight.

446
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,910
If they fight,

447
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,810
you will be remembered forever.

448
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,450
Enough.

449
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,580
What does it have to do with him?

450
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,640
Brother.

451
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,630
I support you.

452
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,520
Zheng.

453
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,840
You just escape.

454
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,500
I will arrest you immediately.

455
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,050
You're helping me get my badge of honor.

456
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,700
But father might break your legs.

457
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,500
If you can't walk, I'll help you.

458
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,520
It won't hinder you from taking a concubine.

459
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,240
Run now.

460
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,300
Legs...

461
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,110
Prince Qi.

462
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,650
You're a mature man.

463
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,820
Why are you still immature?

464
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,930
Why are we here?

465
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,450
As a prince,

466
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,160
shouldn't you think about the peace between Xinchuan and Danchuan?

467
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,780
I know you don't like Shangguan.

468
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,390
I don't like Prince Zheng either.

469
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,520
But I stay here for the sake of Jichuan.

470
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,380
I mean,

471
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't deserve you

472
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,230
and you don't like me.

473
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,550
I think you are very shabbily treated.

474
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,610
What? What are you talking?

475
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,320
It's my business!

476
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,580
What should I do?

477
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,150
We have concerns.

478
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,440
They also have concerns.

479
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,700
After all, they want to vent their anger.

480
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,750
Let's make a pledge

481
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,660
and talk to Madam Danchuan directly.

482
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,320
The pledge should be sincere.

483
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,150
Just accept any punishment!

484
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,850
Maybe you can be saved by this.

485
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,120
Will it work?

486
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,470
[Danpei Hall]

487
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,010
[I, Yin Qi, the fifth Prince of Xinchuan promised never to take a concubine in my life to Shangguan Yan, Madam Danchuan and Shangguan Jing, Princess Danchuan.]

488
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,010
[Take this as proof.]

489
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:39,730
Madam,

490
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,480
Prince Zheng of Xinchuan wants to see you.

491
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,730
Madam Danchuan.

492
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,940
You can be frank, Prince Qi.

493
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,850
This marriage is the proof of the alliance between Xinchuan and Danchuan.

494
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,600
You help the Princess vent the anger

495
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,860
because you want her to have a better life

496
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,160
after going backing.

497
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,250
But I guess

498
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,930
Madam Danchuan has been dissatisfied with the century-old peace alliance for a long time.

499
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,390
You want to take this opportunity to demonstrate to Xinchuan.

500
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,210
How can you say that?

501
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,140
In the nine regions election every three years,

502
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,580
Danchuan usually made many excuses to evade it.

503
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,780
Only when you suffered floods,

504
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,960
and needed our help,

505
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,560
you would unwillingly choose a suitable girl for the peace-making marriage.

506
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,680
Madam Danchuan treated women equally.

507
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,080
You can't bear to let the commoners suffer.

508
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,890
So this responsibility

509
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,800
should be taken by your family.

510
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,280
That's right.

511
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,400
You look down on women,

512
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,820
regard women as objects,

513
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,610
and sacrifice them in exchange for profits.

514
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,070
Danchuan is not like that.

515
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,580
Besides, it's Prince Qi's behavior that

516
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,340
humiliated Danchuan.

517
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,320
Even if I agree to let Jing go back,

518
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,690
I'm afraid my navy won't agree.

519
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,480
Danchuan suffered floods and was saved by Xinchuan.

520
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,750
And the other regions relies on Xinchuan.

521
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,980
Once the war starts,

522
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,230
Danchuan will be alone and helpless.

523
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,510
Are you threatening me?

524
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,550
I dare not.

525
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,310
But we both know

526
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,860
peace is good for everyone.

527
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,260
The century-old peace alliance can't be shaken.

528
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,740
I just want to make a deal with you.

529
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,400
A deal?

530
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,550
What deal?

531
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,300
It's not impossible to change

532
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,030
the rule that forming peace alliances by peace-making marriage.

533
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,560
Now is not the time but it will be in the future.

534
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,670
I'm willing to give you a promise.

535
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,930
If I have the power one day,

536
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,630
I will definitely reform this unreasonable old system of peace-making marriage.

537
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,650
You are good at the maneuver of the skilled diplomats.

538
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,830
But why should I believe you?

539
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,510
You're the prince of Xinchuan.

540
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,120
Will you think about Danchuan?

541
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,720
It is not only for Danchuan,

542
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,490
but for the nine regions.

543
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,380
It's hard to force people to get married.

544
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,450
Instead of making two people be enemies,

545
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,460
it's better to use profit as bases.

546
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,240
Now, we all emphasize on business.

547
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,100
Isn't business more reliable than marriage?

548
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,550
Times change and things should be different.

549
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,610
If Xinchuan is too conservative, it can't be Xinchuan.

550
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,410
Prince Zheng,

551
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,700
I didn't expect

552
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,810
you are so frank in Danchuan.

553
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,250
Madam and I share the same view.

554
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,530
It doesn't matter to be frank.

555
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,740
Besides, if the Princess is willing to return to Xinchuan,

556
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,460
we will definitely restrain Prince Qi.

557
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,300
We won't let her be mistreated again.

558
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,790
That's all I have to say.

559
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,810
Please think about it.

560
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,370
I will practice archery and train soldiers

561
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,860
with my sister in the afternoon.

562
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,510
Thank you, Madam.

563
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,080
I didn't expect her to be so powerful.

564
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,740
Surprised?

565
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,430
Do you regret not treating her well?

566
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,330
I thought

567
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,610
she only used 30% of her power to hit me.

568
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,030
Otherwise, I would've been dead.

569
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,040
Nice shot.

570
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,170
Shangguan.

571
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,770
Well.

572
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,460
Shangguan.

573
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,380
Listen to me.

574
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,520
Shanguan, it's not easy for me to get here.

575
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,330
Shangguan.

576
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,330
Shangguan.

577
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,150
Listen to me.

578
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,280
It's not easy for me to see you here.

579
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,860
I've written a pledge that I'll never take a concubine.

580
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,460
Can you forgive me this time?

581
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,110
-You don't know that I've gone through a lot to see you. -Stop him.

582
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,170
I've never seen those things before.

583
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,910
Madam.

584
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,150
Let me wrap it for you.

585
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,540
It's so hard.

586
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,700
Sister, don't scare him.

587
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,590
He can't stand being frightened.

588
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,790
Are you okay?

589
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm OK. Don't worry.

590
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,960
What are you doing?

591
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,990
That's too much!

592
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,840
I just came to see her.

593
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,200
What?

594
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,740
Do you still want me to die?

595
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,940
You can't see the Princess Danchuan as you wish

596
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,880
unless you pass our test.

597
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,460
Come on.

598
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,920
Let's compete in archery.

599
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,220
If you win her,

600
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,230
I will let my sister give you another chance.

601
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:41,870
What?

602
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,040
You dare not?

603
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,890
He dares.

604
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,600
Why would I dare?

605
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,460
I don't know how.

606
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,290
You don't know how? Learn it!

607
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:46,640
Learn what?

608
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,670
Can I make it now?

609
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,000
How about I compete on behalf of my brother?

610
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,250
What does this have to do with you?

611
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,060
Why not?

612
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,600
We are blood relation.

613
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,090
My Fifth Brother is indeed not good at archery.

614
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,680
Even if your Lady-in-waiting wins,

615
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,740
it would be unfair.

616
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,720
Okay.

617
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,790
Since Prince Zheng joins,

618
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,040
let me compete with you.

619
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,540
Request for comment.

620
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,330
But you have to shoot the target on the boat.

621
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,630
So this is the target on the boat.

622
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,310
I think I can do it at such a close distance.

623
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:43,909
I'll do it.

624
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,920
Who said you would shoot with your eyes opening?

625
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,679
There is a bell under the jade pendant.

626
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,350
You should recognize its location by the sound.

627
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,290
Zheng, you do it.

628
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:02,990
You can do it.

629
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,590
No, no, no.

630
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,200
You do it.

631
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,660
Don't be humble.

632
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,880
It is so urgent now!

633
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,740
I trust you.

634
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,620
Come on.

635
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,540
Prince Zheng.

636
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,050
You flatter me.

637
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,630
Prince Zheng.

638
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,490
Please.

639
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,120
Don't be nervous.

640
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,030
You lost.

641
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,380
You have to admit defeat.

642
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,500
Wait.

643
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,790
How?

644
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,850
Prince Zheng shot the central of the jelly pendant with his arrow.

645
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,860
Impressive!

646
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,080
Prince Zheng.

647
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,180
I lost.

648
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,090
You are flattering me, Madam.

649
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,130
Can you give my brother a chance?

650
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,090
I have my own plan.

651
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,730
Shangguan.

652
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,670
How can you be so good?

653
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,430
You must have practiced secretly behind my back.

654
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,180
You took all the archery classes I didn't attend, right?

655
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,110
You didn't work hard but blame me now.

656
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,040
Congratulations, Your Highness.

657
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,550
You're really something.

658
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,030
Let's go.

659
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,520
Here, eat more.

660
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,270
This tofu is delicious.

661
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,790
Do you like it?

662
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,120
Is it spicy? What do you think?

663
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,580
A little, but I can take it.

664
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,220
Is your hand okay?

665
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,140
Yes.

666
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,690
Actually, I'm in a dilemma now.

667
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,760
I came here

668
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,610
to persuade you to go back.

669
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,930
But as a friend,

670
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,280
I hope you can make your own choice.

671
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,960
Although your sister said if Prince Zheng wins,

672
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,690
you can give Prince Qi a chance.

673
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,030
But it's not the first time that she has broken her promise.

674
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,960
If you're really pushing yourself...

675
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,150
As if someone is talking about me.

676
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,930
Madam.

677
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,860
Don't stand on ceremony.

678
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,520
Have a seat.

679
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,860
Sit.

680
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,340
Jing told me

681
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,810
you were her first friend in Xinchuan.

682
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,150
I have to thank you.

683
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:33,720
Eat.

684
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,520
Here.

685
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,530
The beef is very delicious.

686
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,620
Actually, I feel very good in Danchuan this time.

687
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,540
It's really nice.

688
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,910
It's like coming back to my hometown, Jichuan.

689
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,770
In Jichuan,

690
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,860
everyone chooses a partner according to their wishes.

691
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,400
But my father's official rank is too low.

692
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,920
I had no choice but to marry the prince of Xinchuan.

693
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,490
Were you forced?

694
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,260
Do you mean you didn't want to marry him?

695
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,160
Of course.

696
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,160
Who would like to marry someone they don't know?

697
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,620
So,

698
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,630
we are...

699
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,440
Yes.

700
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,850
We are the same.

701
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,390
Marriage is just a business.

702
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,860
I can order

703
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,500
to let you stay in Danchuan for a matrilocal husband.

704
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,750
Good idea.

705
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,810
At least one of us can get out of this suffering.

706
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,350
Right?

707
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,230
No need.

708
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,040
Prince Zheng

709
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,610
is a nice person.

710
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,310
We get along like friends.

711
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,940
And he never forced us to be a real couple.

712
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,820
So I'm doing fine.

713
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,880
Thank you for your kindness.

714
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,380
Eat up.

715
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,800
What did Shangguan Jing say?

716
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,080
She didn't say yes.

717
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,130
What? Didn't we pass?

718
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,320
Didn't Zheng win the archery?

719
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,520
Why isn't it working?

720
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,020
What's wrong with them?

721
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,490
Prince Qi,

722
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,260
if you want to take her back

723
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,030
because of the order of Lord Xinchuan,

724
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,450
it would be unfair to her.

725
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,440
You should ask yourself

726
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,730
if you want to live with her.

727
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,390
I...

728
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,440
In Danchuan,

729
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,130
we eat hot pot and play mahjong together.

730
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,810
It's so happy.

731
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,570
Although a woman is the head in Danchuan,

732
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,450
we live a peaceful life.

733
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,360
It's not as scary as you said.

734
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,020
I'm not unwilling.

735
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,110
This room is a little hot.

736
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,730
I need some fresh air.

737
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:50,360
It's too stuffy.

738
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,160
You guys talk.

739
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,890
It's too hot.

740
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,750
Dryness-heat.

741
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,200
Actually, it's very possible for him and Shangguan.

742
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,290
I didn't know

743
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,930
you are so good at archery.

744
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,390
You're holding the book upside down.

745
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,630
You're not reading at all.

746
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,500
Did I do something wrong

747
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,860
that made you angry?

748
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,370
If they don't love each other,

749
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,380
even if it's an imperial order,

750
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,660
it's hard to compromise.

751
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,700
I don't like Prince Zheng either.

752
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,960
But I stayed here for the sake of Jichuan.

753
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,380
Zheng.

754
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,310
Zheng.

755
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:38,910
Zheng.

756
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,670
The people from Danchuan Palace are here again.

757
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,670
Let's take a look.

758
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,650
Coming.

759
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,080
The order of Madam Danchuan:

760
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,390
If the alliance between the two regions is based on the engagement,

761
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,730
we would like to invite Prince Zheng of Xinchuan to marry Madam Danchuan

762
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,130
as a matrilocal husband,

763
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,100
contributing to the peace between the two regions.

764
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,730
What is this?

765
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,120
I can distinguish "Zheng" and "Qi".

766
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,010
But

767
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,800
what does it have to do with him?

768
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,260
♫The weather is cool, the clouds are light♫

769
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,480
♫Flowing waters greet people♫

770
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,520
♫In the breeze♫

771
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,310
♫Your gentle smile♫

772
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,690
♫It is remembered in my heart♫

773
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,470
♫The red cherry blossoms fall with the wind♫

774
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:20,830
♫Weapons run out, time passes♫

775
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,100
♫Everything goes with the wind♫

776
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,750
♫As I remember you♫

777
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:32,430
♫I will have a nice day♫

778
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:37,610
♫My life is related with you♫

779
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:43,200
♫The chance meeting made me fall in love at first sight♫

780
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,350
♫Rain and wind♫

781
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,850
♫Wet the footprints♫

782
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:54,590
♫You're the reason I'm here♫

783
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:00,040
♫Mountains and rivers stretch for thousands of miles because of you♫

784
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,700
♫We enjoy at the grassy grass at the pavilion♫

785
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,370
♫My love♫

786
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,540
♫Won't change♫

787
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,790
♫No matter the ends of the earth, I will wait for you♫

788
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:43,990
♫The red cherry blossoms fall with the wind♫

789
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:49,690
♫Weapons run out, time passes♫

790
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,250
♫Everything goes with the wind♫

791
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:56,090
♫As I remember you♫

792
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,770
♫I will have a nice day♫

793
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:06,650
♫I'll give you the rest of my life and we'll be together♫

794
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:12,530
♫We have fallen in love with each other as time goes♫

795
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,870
♫Rain and wind♫

796
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,320
♫Wet the footprints♫
