[Episode 15]

4
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,660
You wait outside every day.

5
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,040
Even if you wait till the cows come home,

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,580
Prince won't call you.

7
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,950
Where is your spirit which you use to fight with me?

8
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,240
Are you depressed

9
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,579
after being hit by Prince?

10
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,120
You and I

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,460
live under the control of the same man.

12
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,900
Are you going to give up?

13
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,110
There's still a long way to go.

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,880
How can you endure it?

15
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,320
Let's go.

16
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,770
Your Highness.

17
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,750
There are so many memorials on the table.

18
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,050
How did you work here?

19
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,070
Madam...

20
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,060
I wrote all these.

21
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,640
Lord returned them all.

22
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,670
Returned?

23
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,570
So Lord means...

24
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,190
You still don't understand?

25
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,870
Lord hasn't seen you for a few days,

26
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,330
and he didn't read your memorials

27
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,160
because he's strict with you.

28
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,680
He hopes you

29
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,570
can understand what he thinks by yourself.

30
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,300
He's really thoughtful.

31
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,940
Your Highness, you're talented.

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,329
In the world,

33
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,290
nobody can match you.

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,620
Madam.

35
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,490
I owe you.

36
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,890
Don't pretend.

37
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,950
I let you visit Prince

38
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,580
because we are all women.

39
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,040
We're locked in the same house.

40
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,000
We don't have a husband who cares about us.

41
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm just worried that

42
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,060
if you suicide one day,

43
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,269
I have to help bury your body.

44
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,450
You and I

45
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,180
are rivals no matter what.

46
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,580
But you treat me sincerely.

47
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,410
I'm ashamed.

48
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,200
Thank you,

49
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,590
Madam.

50
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,650
Your Highness.

51
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,380
May I borrow your paper cutter?

52
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,360
Please wait.

53
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,170
We've known each other for so long.

54
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,160
Can you stop calling me Your Highness?

55
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
It sounds so distant.

56
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,310
Well...

57
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,190
Dear Zheng.

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,090
Why don't you call my name?

59
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,000
It's good.

60
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,210
This letter?

61
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,630
It is from Hao Jia.

62
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,940
Thank you.

63
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,940
You're welcome.

64
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,659
But we're locked.

65
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,140
How did the letter come in?

66
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,800
It's the same as usual.

67
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,180
The person who threw the trash took it in.

68
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Hao Jia said

69
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,100
Prince Song made us locked.

70
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,410
She's sorry.

71
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,590
Last time,

72
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,220
she came to our family's opening banquet.

73
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,350
After she went back,

74
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,590
she was punished to kneel all night.

75
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,770
Recently,

76
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,980
her condition got better.

77
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,350
So are you on purpose to read the letter here?

78
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,880
Hao Jia and I are friends.

79
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,550
Although this is my own business,

80
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,350
she's also a member of the Prince Song's Mansion.

81
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,010
We are on the same boat now.

82
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,830
I should inform you.

83
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm very happy

84
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,180
for what you did.

85
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,250
I'll get going.

86
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,230
Don't work too hard, Yin Zheng.

87
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,880
Your Ladyship, you have been coughing lately.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,010
Have some medicine.

89
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,380
Your Ladyship,

90
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,600
Lady Wei gave the warmer and the hand warmer to you.

91
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,330
She told you not to catch a cold.

92
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,770
Your Ladyship,

93
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,780
it's late.

94
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,200
You should take a rest.

95
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,670
Since we were locked,

96
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,370
we've divided our tasks.

97
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,680
But Prince and Li Wei

98
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,050
have never experienced anything big.

99
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,870
I need to be more secure here.

100
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,400
I need to write down arrangement

101
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,130
of the mansion more carefully.

102
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,250
Otherwise,

103
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,020
we will be in chaos.

104
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,150
Light two lamps for the Princess.

105
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,409
I'll cook some dumplings.

106
00:07:59,409 --> 00:07:59,920
No need.

107
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,730
The Ministry of Internal Affairs thinks that Prince is not favored.

108
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,730
Things they offered are not enough.

109
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,620
I have to set an example.

110
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,520
I can't waste anything.

111
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,910
But Your Ladyship...

112
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,970
Shangguan Jing.

113
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,870
-What? -Wait.

114
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,660
Your Highness.

115
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,360
I want to know if you'll die without these weapons?

116
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,560
You are also taking so many damn stones.

117
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
-Why should I leave my weapons? -How can you call them damn stones!

118
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,360
Mine are precious jades.

119
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,850
It's much more valuable than yours, you know?

120
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,610
Cut the crap.

121
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,270
You just think my weapons are heavy.

122
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,440
Don't carry it if you can't.

123
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,960
Don't push yourself.

124
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,679
I said I'll carry it.

125
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,049
As a man,

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,140
it's nothing.

127
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,330
No.

128
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,740
Your Highness.

129
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,040
Your Highness.

130
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,720
Are you alright?

131
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,980
You can't do anything.

132
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,670
I'm so miserable.

133
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,510
No one helped me apply the medication.

134
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,510
It hurts.

135
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,240
It dropped.

136
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:11,880
Oh! No!

137
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,510
I can't bend down and pick it up.

138
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:13,980
No.

139
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,020
Is it straight?

140
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,880
Is this a bed or a torture tool?

141
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,550
If you have time,

142
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,900
prepare for the opening banquet.

143
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,430
The guests and menu have not been decided yet.

144
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,300
What?

145
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,220
In other families, these are managed by the hostess.

146
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,310
Don't talk about men and women with me.

147
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,120
You should decide whom you will invite.

148
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Shangguan, I don't ask you to be virtuous.

149
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,060
I just beg you

150
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,280
please cooperate with me sometimes.

151
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,170
Why can't you yield to me?

152
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Fine.

153
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,280
Fine.

154
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,090
Whatever you like.

155
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,520
No one needs to compromise.

156
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,030
OK.

157
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,560
After all, you don't have any friends,

158
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,730
except Prince Zheng.

159
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,680
But he's locked up.

160
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,490
It's OK to cancel the opening banquet.

161
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,200
Go!

162
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,170
Fine.

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,850
-Otherwise... -Otherwise...

164
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,650
-Find an excuse? -Find an excuse?

165
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,980
-Cancel it? -Cancel it?

166
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,090
But

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,510
what's the reason?

168
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,090
Let me think.

169
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,570
How about

170
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,470
giving them food boxes?

171
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,420
One for each.

172
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,790
There's no need for entertainment.

173
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,850
Although we are locked,

174
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,520
Lord allowed us

175
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,570
to eat the food box sent by Prince Yan.

176
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,570
It's so touching.

177
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,410
Come.

178
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,570
We are sisters.

179
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,370
Eat.

180
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,940
-Your Ladyship, you first. -Your Ladyship, you first.

181
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,070
Let's eat together.

182
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,870
Great!

183
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,660
Look.

184
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,990
You can even see your breath now.

185
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,270
Ha.

186
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,130
Let's see

187
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,500
whose breath is bigger.

188
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,120
Spring.

189
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,730
Be locked.

190
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,920
Your Ladyship...

191
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,500
I won.

192
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,490
What?

193
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,250
If you do this, we can do it, too.

194
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,980
Look at my breath.

195
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,370
It's bigger than yours.

196
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,860
It's so boring.

197
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,380
-Yes. -Yes.

198
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,200
I don't know

199
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,250
what day it is today.

200
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,550
I know that.

201
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,280
February 18.

202
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:01,890
No.

203
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,080
We can't waste our time anymore.

204
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,500
We need to do something meaningful.

205
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,530
You are...

206
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:22,990
We're one man short.

207
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,640
We're waiting for you.

208
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,880
I have official documents to read.

209
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,520
Just two rounds.

210
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,440
It won't take long.

211
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,720
-Sit, please. -Give your official documents to me.

212
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,850
I'll keep it for you.

213
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,920
Here are the bargaining chips.

214
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,550
It's the same.

215
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,220
It's fair.

216
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,910
Fine.

217
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,470
We should do something meaningful.

218
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:41,740
I won.

219
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:44,920
How is that possible?

220
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,770
Did you cheat?

221
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,510
It's hard to win with him.

222
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,830
He can calculate the number of cards.

223
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,700
Really?

224
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,560
I don't believe it.

225
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:51,970
Again.

226
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,170
I won.

227
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,240
Again.

228
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,740
I won.

229
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,490
Again?

230
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:02,890
I won!

231
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,730
I won!

232
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,730
I won!

233
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,240
I won!

234
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:10,800
I won!

235
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,780
I won!

236
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,420
I won!

237
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,460
I won!

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,410
I won!

239
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,170
I won!

240
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,200
I won!

241
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,250
I won!

242
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
What card is this?

243
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,720
I've never seen it.

244
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,280
It doesn't count.

245
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,610
He definitely cheated.

246
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,650
You are so smart.

247
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,080
I quit.

248
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,910
This kid.

249
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,720
How can!

250
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,170
-I have nothing! -I quit!

251
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:46,980
Go on.

252
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,420
Go on?

253
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,360
Your Highness, how about this?

254
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,270
Are we getting colder and colder?

255
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,910
How about

256
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,180
going out?

257
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,690
I agree.

258
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,730
Fine.

259
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,750
This line is the boundary.

260
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,250
Fair and open.

261
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,300
Three each.

262
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,410
If you get it, it's yours.

263
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,160
Here.

264
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,510
I want the red bracelet.

265
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,440
That bracelet is mine.

266
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,080
You're not meant to be with it.

267
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,470
It will be mine soon.

268
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,430
Let's see if you can get it.

269
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,130
Missed.

270
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,250
Missed.

271
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,340
I have more.

272
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Let me try.

273
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,160
It's indeed difficult.

274
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,810
Yes.

275
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,680
I have another one.

276
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,750
You can't get it.

277
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,030
Congratulations on getting a jadeite bracelet.

278
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,030
But that's my bracelet.

279
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,620
My bracelet!

280
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,710
It's okay. You can get others.

281
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,340
Miss Song.

282
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,870
Change to something difficult.

283
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,860
I want that vase.

284
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,800
Try it.

285
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,540
Hurry up.

286
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,330
Go.

287
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,130
Almost.

288
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,260
Up.

289
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,000
Almost.

290
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,490
How about

291
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,140
letting me try?

292
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,000
Just try.

293
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,500
Here, Chef Liu.

294
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,940
If you get it, it's yours.

295
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,740
Let me try one first.

296
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,900
By good luck.

297
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,900
Then you can get that,

298
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,010
a hand warmer.

299
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,100
Really?

300
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,620
By luck.

301
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,190
Baoquan.

302
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,600
That pot plant.

303
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,710
You can have mine.

304
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,670
Go on.

305
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,850
That one far away.

306
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,560
-So jealous! -Thank you.

307
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,690
That bracelet...

308
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,220
Put it gently.

309
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,840
Baoquan.

310
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,590
Are you here to stock up?

311
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,410
You

312
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,610
shouldn't be a chef.

313
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,410
Well, Prince.

314
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,900
Why don't we find something else?

315
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,320
Sure.

316
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,170
I think this is all we can get.

317
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,510
I think of a place.

318
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,300
We've never been to Princess Yuan Ying's room, right?

319
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,750
Princess Yuan Ying has a very beautiful bottle.

320
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,330
Yes.

321
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,090
Yuan Ying.

322
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,380
Why is my back so cold?

323
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,730
You're having fun.

324
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,830
Did I ask you to take it off?

325
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,840
The mansion is locked,

326
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,510
but you still lead people to play.

327
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,630
I think you're not only broad-minded,

328
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,359
but your mind

329
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,280
can hold the whole nine regions.

330
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,140
Your Ladyship,

331
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,170
everyone is nervous

332
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,280
when we are locked.

333
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,310
It's not bad to relax occasionally.

334
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,730
Why don't you look in the mirror

335
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,390
and see yourself?

336
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,280
And you.

337
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,180
Childish!

338
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,150
It's been 15 days.

339
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,770
According to the worst plan,

340
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,310
we should find something.

341
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,240
But now?

342
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,980
-We can... -Forget it.

343
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,050
I thought,

344
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,880
I could go back to Jinchuan

345
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,850
next month.

346
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,240
But now...

347
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,430
Your Highness, I wanted to trust you.

348
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,290
But now,

349
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,290
everything you do

350
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,950
is really worrying.

351
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,850
I can't leave you alone anymore.

352
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,640
It was me who made us locked.

353
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,800
It's my fault.

354
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,910
But please believe that in a few days,

355
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,850
our plan will work soon.

356
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,350
Yuan Ying, don't be angry.

357
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,890
Don't play this trick on me.

358
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,880
Now the Legitimate Eldest Prince

359
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,140
is in charge of the market with Prince An.

360
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,550
Prince An repeatedly reported

361
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,500
that there are not enough people on duty at night.

362
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,480
In that case,

363
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,070
let the two brothers who just attended the court meeting

364
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,520
experience it with you.

365
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,400
-Yes. -Yes.

366
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,570
An.

367
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,210
Brother.

368
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,660
Don't you know

369
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,290
Qi and Zheng are close?

370
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,450
Now,

371
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,610
you deliberately planted him in.

372
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,080
What are you planning?

373
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,920
Brother, you worry too much.

374
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,960
You worry too much.

375
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,920
The night market

376
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,190
makes money.

377
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,160
I made a lot of money

378
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,560
by marketing at night.

379
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,410
Brother,

380
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,560
you're unwilling to manage the night market, right?

381
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
But since you taught Zheng a lesson,

382
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,840
I'm the only one left.

383
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,200
I...

384
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,600
I really can't manage it.

385
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,130
I do need someone.

386
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,280
All right, I got it.

387
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,820
You are just

388
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,350
a greedy man.

389
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,250
You know me.

390
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,350
As long as the original people of the Ministry of Revenue

391
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,150
don't change.

392
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,510
It's up to you.

393
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,980
Thank you for your understanding.

394
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,820
Prince An?

395
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,250
So you are the ones

396
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,590
who help Prince An manage the night market.

397
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,010
Inequality rather than want is the cause of trouble.

398
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,100
Father sacrificed me

399
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,540
to appease the resentment of the Legitimate Eldest Prince and the elders in the court.

400
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,510
But for Father,

401
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:07,700
I am still

402
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,530
a useful pawn.

403
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,640
But if he wants to use me again,

404
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,000
he has to make others think it's not biased

405
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,600
but equal.

406
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,570
I understand.

407
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,500
Isn't it just waiting for Prince Qi to attend the court meeting

408
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,560
so that he can help?

409
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,920
The Legitimate Eldest Prince and the elders of the Ministry of Revenue

410
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,240
are not interested in the night market,

411
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,750
and they don't know how to control it.

412
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,770
But for Father,

413
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,750
opening the night market is extremely necessary.

414
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,840
My brother

415
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,880
only knows how to deal with me.

416
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
He can't deal with this mess.

417
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,600
I've read your plan.

418
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,010
It looks better than

419
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
Jinchuan's methods.

420
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,970
If you don't mind,

421
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,000
you can take it back.

422
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,020
Consider it

423
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,180
as my gift.

424
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,740
No need.

425
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,310
I will make a more suitable plan

426
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,410
for Jinchuan.

427
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,020
Butler Su,

428
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,200
it's time to hand over Prince Zheng's plan

429
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,230
to Prince An.

430
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,110
Wait.

431
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,890
But aren't we locked?

432
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,740
How can we deliver the letter?

433
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,320
Li Wei thought of a way

434
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,040
to give it to the man who dumps the waste

435
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,440
and ask him to take it out.

436
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,290
I'll do it now.

437
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,670
Make Yin Qi join in.

438
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,140
He can get a job.

439
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,490
We can proceed with the next plan.

440
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,950
Wait.

441
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,550
What's the next step?

442
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,350
Find young soldiers

443
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,100
who can stay up late to be on duty.

444
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,960
What's the use?

445
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,200
The reason why those elder officials are unhappy about opening the night market

446
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,660
is that they are too tired.

447
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,070
The night market can be open until 23 o'clock.

448
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,430
Then they have to stay up late to work.

449
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,420
So,

450
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,740
we need to recruit soldiers who can stay up late

451
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,270
to manage the night market.

452
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,650
This job has high physical requirements.

453
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,480
So there's no need to limit it to the talents of the imperial examination.

454
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,200
In this way,

455
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,140
the grass roots will have a chance.

456
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,940
But I think we should train them.

457
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,900
Otherwise,

458
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,460
they're not in sync.

459
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,150
I'm afraid that they will cause trouble.

460
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,780
Besides,

461
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,850
we need to increase their salary and perks.

462
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,350
and let them have a holiday by turns.

463
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,320
During the break,

464
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,720
They should study from the teacher invited

465
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,090
to improve their quality.

466
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,190
We've discussed it.

467
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,600
After the night market stabilizes,

468
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,240
let women try to do business.

469
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,320
Women are good at making handicrafts,

470
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,160
food, and snacks,

471
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,790
which are suitable to be sold at the night market.

472
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,600
Well,

473
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,420
you didn't tell me.

474
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,300
We just thought about it.

475
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,520
After all, we're in Xinchuan.

476
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,720
It's not good for a woman

477
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,120
to do business in public.

478
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,440
It's a little difficult to execute it.

479
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,820
But I think

480
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,330
we can give it a try.

481
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,580
I think so.

482
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,070
Me, too.

483
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,910
Women do business.

484
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,530
It sounds great.

485
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,010
Your needlework is so good.

486
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,060
As long as you are willing,

487
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,520
you can support yourself.

488
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,470
I'm afraid that people outside are not careful.

489
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,720
Please let me check the day-to-day account

490
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,620
in the night market again.

491
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,490
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

492
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,580
I have finished.

493
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,790
Enjoy your meal.

494
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,090
She...

495
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,680
Has she eaten?

496
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,270
No.

497
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,960
Is she still alive?

498
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,560
She's not tired?

499
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,610
Something is missing.

500
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,010
Should we add

501
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,560
an anti-counterfeit mark?

502
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,100
I didn't expect it.

503
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,650
Fortunately, you're meticulous.

504
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,650
Things which you need

505
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,090
are sent to the mansion

506
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,600
after they are purchased by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

507
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,950
Most of the time, your wallet

508
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,410
is preserved bu Butler Su.

509
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,750
It's normal that you don't know.

510
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,690
Get it.

511
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,490
Your Highness.

512
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,100
Your Ladyship.

513
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,220
Your Highness.

514
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,460
Someone from the palace said

515
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,240
Lord wants to see you.

516
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,750
Your brother's chess skills were all taught by me.

517
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,270
But when it comes to Qi,

518
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,870
I couldn't teach him.

519
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,840
I didn't expect you

520
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,230
to be so skillful.

521
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,250
You have known when

522
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,240
and how to lose to me

523
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,030
without any trace.

524
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,650
I wonder who taught you this.

525
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,310
I studied by myself.

526
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,650
No one taught me.

527
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,460
You must give An and Qi

528
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,020
advice on

529
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,160
the management of the night market, right?

530
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,150
If you, as a father, want me to apologize for overstepping,

531
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,290
I will submit to you.

532
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,520
But if you, as the Lord, want me

533
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,450
to apologize for my overstepping,

534
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,820
please forgive me for not being able to do it.

535
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,570
Tell me.

536
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,980
Although Xinchuan is the top and the strongest of the nine regions,

537
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,380
many concepts

538
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,010
are unchanged and outdated.

539
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,170
It's not as good as Jinchuan and Danchuan.

540
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,430
Luckily, Father

541
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,140
agreed to change the market

542
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,820
so that agriculture and commerce can develop together,

543
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,300
and Xinchuan's economy boosts significantly.

544
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,700
But with these policies,

545
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,930
there are many people

546
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,130
stopping us.

547
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,280
So,

548
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,820
I know what to do,

549
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
but I dare not speak frankly.

550
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,270
Just say it.

551
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,350
Although the night market

552
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,820
was successful,

553
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,990
it just broke the time limit.

554
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,730
If we want to go further,

555
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,960
we need to break the limitations in the area.

556
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,190
It won't be limited to the traditional concept of East and West Markets.

557
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,170
We need to build stores

558
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,760
in the dwelling district.

559
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,380
Besides,

560
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,120
the gold, silver and copper

561
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,920
may be a burden to carry.

562
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,580
Maybe

563
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,010
we can launch the new currency.

564
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,350
Father, look.

565
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,000
Is this the pattern of the new currency?

566
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,810
You don't plan to make the coppers anymore?

567
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,830
In fact, there are also peddlers

568
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,850
trading with paper deeds instead of coppers.

569
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,510
And there is also a record

570
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,110
about a reformer in the previous dynasty.

571
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,550
They used paper deeds with the official seal to replace the coppers.

572
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,240
But they didn't manage it well.

573
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,300
It didn't survive.

574
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,930
So I think

575
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,580
if we improve the system and strengthen the management,

576
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,990
launching the new currency

577
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,720
is possible.

578
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,530
You're thoughtful.

579
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,160
You're brave.

580
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,870
I've crossed the line.

581
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,360
But if we keep being conservative,

582
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,240
knowing it can be changed,

583
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,480
but just observing from the sidelines,

584
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,140
I'm not being a good official.

585
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,200
Please punish me, Father.

586
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,090
I'll punish you

587
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,970
by letting you have another round with me.

588
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,240
Your Ladyship.

589
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,440
Your Ladyship.

590
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,480
-What's wrong? -Your Ladyship.

591
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,600
Please save Lady Ying.

592
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,590
She suddenly fainted

593
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,670
when she was checking the accounts.

594
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,910
We wanted to go out to get a doctor.

595
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,840
We were stopped.

596
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,150
The edict hasn't arrived yet.

597
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,250
We can't let you out.

598
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,090
Lady is Princess Jinchuan.

599
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,920
If anything happens,

600
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,180
how many times do you want to die?

601
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,230
If you're talking nonsense,

602
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,000
it will be our fault.

603
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,920
She's already sick.

604
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,380
Do I have to show her to you?

605
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,010
Move!

606
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,180
What are you doing?

607
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,220
What are you doing?

608
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,740
Leave.

609
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,460
Song Wu, come here.

610
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,070
Leave.

611
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,470
On the Mid-Autumn Festival Banquet,

612
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,370
how did you

613
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,650
make the fire so big?

614
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,600
What are you talking about?

615
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,410
It wasn't me.

616
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,430
Get out of my way!

617
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,480
Your Ladyship,

618
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,210
someone will die.

619
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,060
Move!

620
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,130
Move!

621
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,250
Move!

622
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,050
Stop!

623
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,760
This is the order of Lord Xinchuan.

624
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,320
The confinement order has been withdrawn.

625
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,120
Open the door.

626
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,630
She's awake.

627
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,090
Her Ladyship is awake.

628
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,680
Are you feeling better?

629
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,020
Lady Wei,

630
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,870
may I have a word with you?

631
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,520
Lady Ying is weak.

632
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,640
She has been suffering from fatigue.

633
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,500
Now the wind has invaded her body,

634
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,920
and she relapsed.

635
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,310
I prescribed some Jinqianlidan soup.

636
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,380
But don't tire her out.

637
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,510
She must take good care of herself.

638
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,700
Otherwise,

639
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,470
it may affect her lifespan.

640
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,420
Thank you, imperial physician.

641
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,270
Your Ladyship, you are in such condition.

642
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,830
Why are you still wanting to check the accounts?

643
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,480
Today must borrow nothing of tomorrow.

644
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,650
I can't delay it.

645
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,610
Your Ladyship.

646
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,450
Let me get up.

647
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,430
Your Ladyship.

648
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,760
The imperial physician said

649
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,070
if you keep working hard,

650
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,390
your lifespan will be damaged.

651
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,230
What are you trying so hard for?

652
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,180
Grapes and I are from the Ministry of Internal Affairs,

653
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,560
but we have regarded you as our real master.

654
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,780
I was taught before that

655
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,960
I should say auspicious words to my master.

656
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,760
But,

657
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,770
I never thought

658
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,860
one day I would

659
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,400
wish you longevity.

660
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,540
You can't waste your energy anymore.

661
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,090
Yes.

662
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,680
Your Ladyship, take care of yourself.

663
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,870
You are still young.

664
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,900
I've never given up.

665
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,260
But my health condition

666
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,900
disappointed me.

667
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,060
Your Ladyship, take a rest.

668
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,270
We didn't ask you to admit defeat,

669
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,440
but let you rest.

670
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,630
Lady Wei, please persuade Princess.

671
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,930
What are you doing?

672
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,960
Take the medicine first.

673
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,070
For checking the accounts,

674
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,400
I've learned a lot.

675
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,190
I thought I could help you.

676
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,310
You

677
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,640
just take a good rest

678
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,120
and take a few days off.

679
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,570
After a few days of rest,

680
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,900
you'll find that the world won't collapse

681
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,240
and you'll have nothing to lose.

682
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,350
For the responsibilities in the world,

683
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,670
you shoulder the 80%.

684
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,020
Share me some.

685
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:53,970
Take a rest.

686
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,280
Why didn't you let me sleep in my room?

687
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,970
Her Ladyship cared about you.

688
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,570
She wanted you to sleep more.

689
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,060
You're up.

690
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,530
Did you sleep well last night?

691
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,830
I'm sorry, Your Ladyship.

692
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,030
I drove you to the guest room last night.

693
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,270
You stayed up all night to check so many accounts.

694
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,470
You should rest more.

695
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,900
I've checked the accounts.

696
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,290
There's no problem.

697
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,320
You've indeed improved a lot.

698
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,800
Why did you check the accounts?

699
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,550
Didn't we agree that you should have a good rest?

700
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,350
You're right.

701
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,350
We need to combine work and rest.

702
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,410
I've slept enough.

703
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,220
I need to get up and work for a while.

704
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,350
Otherwise, my bones

705
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,420
will be lazy.

706
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,010
I think

707
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,770
you're a real immortal cultivator.

708
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,370
You don't need to rest at all.

709
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,800
Now,

710
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,920
you're not doing eight trigrams boxing,

711
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,250
you're absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

712
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,530
In order to recover soon,

713
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,120
I made an exercise plan.

714
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,400
Sleep early and wake up early.

715
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,290
Do eight trigrams boxing every morning,

716
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,500
and five-animal boxing every night.

717
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,030
Meanwhile, eat regularly.

718
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,150
From now on,

719
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,560
you must follow it, too.

720
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,190
What we understand about combining exertion and rest

721
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,139
is different.

722
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,020
Since you've checked the accounts,

723
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,020
why don't you take a good rest today?

724
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,170
But

725
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,710
according to my arrangement today...

726
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,570
Spring is here.

727
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,719
The weather is so nice.

728
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,380
Trust me.

729
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,040
If you have a good rest today,

730
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,110
you'll recover faster.

731
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,639
Let's go.

732
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,170
I've never seen anyone

733
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,130
fly a kite so rigidly.

734
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
Isn't that right?

735
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,050
It's right.

736
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,310
But

737
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,110
it would be better

738
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,100
if you relax more.

739
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,380
No.

740
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,810
I'm trying very hard

741
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,840
to relax.

742
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,310
If you can't play it anymore,

743
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,170
just let it fly away with the wind.

744
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,390
Actually,

745
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,530
you can live more freely

746
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,560
like this kite.

747
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,700
You worked so hard.

748
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,440
I think Lord Jinchuan

749
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,710
and Madam Jinchuan

750
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,550
must be very strict with you.

751
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,780
But sometimes,

752
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:37,870
maybe

753
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,560
you don't have to work so hard to be perfect.

754
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,460
Relaxing

755
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,180
will make you happier.

756
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,380
To be honest,

757
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,220
this is the first time that someone cares about

758
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,220
whether I'm happy

759
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,680
instead of whether I'm doing well.

760
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,540
Maybe your parents also think so.

761
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,120
But if parents love their children,

762
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,720
they will consider too much.

763
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,080
Maybe they want you to be perfect

764
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,390
to get what you want.

765
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,920
What I want

766
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,490
is what I shouldn't pursue

767
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,170
thought by my closest relatives.

768
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,070
But Princess Yuan Ying

769
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,090
won't give up, right?

770
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,100
♫The clouds are quietly looking up♫

771
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,770
Being either a man or a woman,

772
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,610
♫The sky is light and the wind is cool and here comes a secret fragrance♫

773
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,980
Princess Yuan Ying is the best.

774
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,540
So,

775
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:39,360
♫The paper kite flutters and bids farewell to the wanderings of the past♫

776
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,640
just pursue what you want.

777
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,470
They will understand in the future.

778
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,520
♫The road ahead looks far away♫

779
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,870
♫The world is wide♫

780
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:52,770
♫Cold or warm, you're by my side♫

781
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,830
What about you?

782
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,190
♫Spring flowers are fearless and love grows among the thorns♫

783
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,090
What do you want the most?

784
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:05,850
♫The summer breeze is dying, the sun is burning, it's all but ordinary♫

785
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:12,970
♫Autumn leaves fall, waiting for you and me to write a new chapter♫

786
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,820
What I want

787
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,780
is here.

788
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:18,510
♫After the winter snow comes the warm sunshine ♫

789
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,900
♫Spring flowers are fearless and love grows among the thorns♫

790
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:32,490
♫The summer breeze is dying, the sun is burning, it's all but ordinary♫

791
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:39,530
♫Autumn leaves fall, waiting for you and me to write a new chapter♫

792
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:45,180
♫After the winter snow comes the warm sunshine ♫

793
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:52,570
♫We stumbled through yesterday♫

794
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,080
♫Tonight's dream slowly flows through your fingers♫

795
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:06,330
♫We're about to stay together for years and years♫

796
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:12,100
♫We'll travel together for years and years♫

797
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
Look, who's here?

798
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,710
Sister Ying,

799
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,950
help me with this.

800
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,250
OK.

801
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:47,910
Zai,

802
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,010
if you want to build this,

803
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,970
you need to know

804
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,750
the structure of the mortise and tenon joint.

805
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,160
Look.

806
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,990
The convex part

807
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,940
is called the tenon.

808
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,640
Then concave part

809
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,040
is called the mortise.

810
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,220
Look.

811
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,170
He's so young. He doesn't know the structure.

812
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,300
I think

813
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,050
you're used to being a teacher.

814
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,500
He's still a kid.

815
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,380
Teaching should be combined with entertainment.

816
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,910
We need to start teaching children when they're young.

817
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,510
Don't slack off for a moment.

818
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,130
Come.

819
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,670
Zai.

820
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,580
Try it.

821
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,070
Try this again.

822
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,710
Zai.

823
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,810
Try this.

824
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,140
What's wrong with you guys?

825
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,800
You don't take me with you.

826
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,260
We do.

827
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,490
No you don't.

828
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,930
After Princess Yuan Ying came here,

829
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,560
you haven't played with me.

830
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,280
Now that we've had our mansion,

831
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,540
I don't have to go to school in the palace.

832
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,770
I'm alone in my room every day.

833
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,400
It's really boring.

834
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,290
Stop laughing.

835
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,210
Alright.

836
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,210
We'll take you with us next time, okay?

837
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:05,870
You said it.

838
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,820
Come on.

839
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,150
I can do this too.

840
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,570
I've taught you just now.

841
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,470
Why can't you do it? You're so stupid.

842
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,200
You're so clumsy. You're so clumsy.

843
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,210
You're so stupid.

844
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,750
You're worse than me.

845
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,550
How am I not as good as you?

846
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,920
Try again.

847
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,850
Your Highness.

848
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,280
Lady Wei wants you to play with Prince Zai.

849
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,480
They miss you so much.

850
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,540
You haven't finished yet.

851
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,480
I'll tell them to keep it down.

852
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,190
Forget it.

853
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,110
For a family,

854
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,080
it's good to be livelier.

855
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,550
Since Lady Wei married you,

856
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,990
our family has indeed become livelier.

857
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,830
You look happier than before.

858
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,870
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

859
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,100
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

860
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,600
♫A gust of wind blows♫

861
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,070
♫And stops by my ear♫

862
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,360
♫The moon shines♫

863
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,660
♫In my heart♫

864
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,230
♫Your smiles are all over♫

865
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,870
♫Gradually I am used to♫

866
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,790
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

867
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:58,500
♫I don't dare to get related♫

868
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,610
♫But you came to me♫

869
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,270
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫

870
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,970
♫I don't know what to say. I am so excited♫

871
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,770
♫But you can tell what is in my heart with your eyes♫

872
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:19,460
♫The road is long. Luckily, I have you♫

873
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,780
♫In rivers and mountains, let's appreciate the smoke rising♫

874
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,850
♫The past is gone with the sunrise♫

875
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:33,530
♫The warmth in your palm is in my heart♫

876
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,220
♫Let's share the light in wind, snow, and coldness♫

877
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:45,510
♫I am relieved when you are with me♫

878
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,150
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

879
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,490
