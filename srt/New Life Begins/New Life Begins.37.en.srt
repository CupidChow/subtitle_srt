[Episode 37]

4
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,900
Leave these things to the servants.

5
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,479
Your Highness, do you think

6
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,370
just because I'm pregnant,

7
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,260
I can't take care of anything?

8
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,020
No, I don't.

9
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm afraid you'll get tired.

10
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,910
Do you have something to say to me?

11
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,300
Prince Zheng is back in the court?

12
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
You know about it.

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,460
I'm afraid you'll be worried.

14
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,050
The Lord's appointment

15
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,700
has been filled with suspicion from the beginning.

16
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,220
We didn't even stand a chance.

17
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,680
But we've fought hard for the chance.

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Even if the bait is poisoned,

19
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,810
we must take it.

20
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,140
How come now that we've hit a rough patch,

21
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,190
and Your Highness wants to give up?

22
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,710
Xiyuan.

23
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,610
From now on,

24
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,770
let's just live our lives in peace.

25
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,960
The Lord is not happy with me.

26
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,990
I'm afraid that if this continues…

27
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,850
Your Highness.

28
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,410
Life is not something you bow to.

29
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,490
It's earned.

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,180
It's obvious the Lord means to

31
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,390
rein in Prince Jun.

32
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,090
You're back.

33
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:40,850
Zheng.

34
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,240
I missed you so much.

35
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,050
They said you were sick.

36
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,780
I and Mother are very worried about you.

37
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,780
Madam He brought you ginseng and Ganoderma for your health.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,020
Thank you, Mother.

39
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,190
Have a seat.

40
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,880
The kitchen has made goat tripe soup.

41
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,420
Let's all have some.

42
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,880
It's can dispel coldness.

43
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,430
Just a moment.

44
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,100
Goat tripe?

45
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,180
Since when do you eat this?

46
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,880
It's all because of her.

47
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,610
Really?

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,420
I heard from the nanny who took care of him

49
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,880
that no one can make him not picky about food.

50
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,870
Brother.

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
Actually, Mother always asked people

52
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,180
what it was like when you were a child.

53
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,640
He must have been a pickier eater than he is now.

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
Madam He, you don't know

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,140
how hard it is to solve his picky eating problem.

56
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,800
You have to trick him into eating

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
like you do with Yin Zai.

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,140
For example, he doesn't like goat tripe.

59
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,930
Goat tripe looks like mushrooms.

60
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,630
So I told him it was mushrooms

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,080
and tricked him into eating it.

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,680
Although he doesn't like it,

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,140
it's good for his health.

64
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,960
I knew it's goat tripe.

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,190
I just didn't want to expose you.

66
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,840
But you ate it anyway, didn't you?

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,530
He's lucky to have you.

68
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,100
Don't say that, Madam He.

69
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
I'm lucky to have him.

70
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,810
You're still calling me madam?

71
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,550
Mother.

72
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,820
Here it is.

73
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,880
Here's the goat tripe soup.

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,200
Taste it.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,460
Exclusive recipe.

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,580
Try it.

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,520
Prince Zai.

78
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,880
I'd better go back to my room.

79
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,120
No.

80
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
When you were in Canghe Town,

81
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,210
I could only go to sleep with you in my sight.

82
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,820
If you're not here,

83
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,680
I won't be able to sleep.

84
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,160
Come on.

85
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,580
I want to blow out the candle.

86
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,800
No need.

87
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,630
Just…

88
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,710
Just go to sleep like this.

89
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,160
Do you know

90
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,910
what I was thinking

91
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,690
when you were sick in Canghe Town?

92
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,240
What?

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,860
I was thinking,

94
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,610
if you still died

95
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,909
under my care,

96
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,220
I should be executed

97
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,940
according to Xinchuan's law.

98
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,659
I was thinking,

99
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,480
should I just die with you

100
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,770
or should I wait for the execution?

101
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
As I thought about it,

102
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,000
I became fearless of death.

103
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,370
As long as I can be by your side,

104
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,620
it seems I'm okay with anything.

105
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,310
When you first came to Xinchuan,

106
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,350
you wanted to be a widow.

107
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,120
If I really died,

108
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,420
it might be your dream…

109
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,980
I didn't mean it.

110
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,680
Don't say that anymore.

111
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,680
It's unlucky.

112
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,960
What's wrong with that?

113
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,980
To be a widow.

114
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,700
I'm going to die.

115
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,930
♫The south wind meets the clouds and the moonlight echoes with the candle♫

116
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,480
I remember you have many pockets on your clothes.

117
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,750
♫As far as the eye can see, it's just a regular sight♫

118
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,260
Does this one have it too?

119
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,230
♫Why am I being absent-minded? And why am I hesitating?♫

120
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,360
I don't believe it.

121
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,300
I have to check it out.

122
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,260
♫I'm worried that you'll see through my mind by my eyes♫

123
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,180
♫My words are not surprising. Nor is my language inaccurate♫

124
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,110
♫I've got some affection towards you♫

125
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,890
♫I don't speak in an excessive way. Nor do I express my feelings♫

126
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,690
♫Who should I tell about the one I love?♫

127
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,790
♫By now, my words have turned into wind, and my thoughts of you has melted into fog♫

128
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,550
♫I wrote about the past into a letter♫

129
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:51,210
♫If you and I know each other well, there's no need to write more♫

130

♫I love you deeply and there's nothing else I ask for♫

132

♫I only wish the two of us could love each other as one soul, eat three meals together and spend the four seasons together♫

133
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,620
Why are you up so early?

134
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,090
I couldn't sleep.

135
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,700
Sleep a little longer.

136
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,560
Aren't you going to the morning review?

137
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,940
No hurry.

138
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
It's not time yet.

139
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,380
It's not yet time, anyway.

140
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,840
What are you doing?

141
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,170
My Lord.

142
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,310
Prince Jun is here first for the morning review.

143
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
He's been waiting outside the hall.

144
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,480
I see.

145
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,220
My Lord.

146
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,690
I'll go get your medicine.

147
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,950
Prince Jun came at around 5 o'clock.

148
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,540
He's been waiting until now.

149
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,060
Do you think

150
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,610
he doesn't understand what the Lord means?

151
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,720
The Lord told Prince Jun to go back to his mansion to rest.

152
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,270
That means the Lord didn't want to see him

153
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,870
and meant to keep a distance.

154
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,490
Prince Jun understands it the most

155
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,380
in the entire palace.

156
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,330
If not,

157
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,940
he wouldn't be guilty now.

158
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,570
It's said that those who know the right time are elites.

159
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,910
But he who knows the time too well

160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,410
can only be an elite,

161
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,860
not a ruler.

162
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,160
I understand.

163
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,280
Stay wary in front of the Lord.

164
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,400
You should stay home and rest

165
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,890
these days.

166
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,080
Ask Li Wei to make you some good food.

167
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,460
Yes.

168
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,520
All the best, My Lord.

169
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,310
Zheng is just getting better.

170
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,420
You don't need to come for the morning review.

171
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,740
Take care of yourself at home.

172
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,400
I've recovered well.

173
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,120
Don't worry, Father.

174
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,940
Father.

175
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,810
Zheng just won't admit it.

176
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,080
If not for Canghe's letter,

177
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,670
I wouldn't have known about it.

178
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,760
He had a fever that wouldn't go away for days

179
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,890
and was gravely ill,

180
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,790
vomiting blood

181
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,350
in the cold town of Canghe.

182
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,710
-He almost died in Cang…-Don't say that.

183
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,150
I had the plague.

184
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,770
It's not like I was poisoned.

185
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,830
Zheng.

186
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You've suffered.

187
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,440
An has made this a big deal.

188
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,020
I've taken a few pills.

189
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,090
Plus, Li Wei has made me food supplements.

190
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,020
I'm getting stronger than before.

191
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,340
Li Wei

192
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,180
is really a genius on diet.

193
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,180
I'll ask Liang Shi to go to the Imperial Hospital

194
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,910
for some tonic medicine

195
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,200
and send it to your mansion.

196
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,620
Thank you, Father.

197
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,790
You can leave now.

198
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:21,740
Yes.

199
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,340
Jun.

200
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,340
That's not very clever of you.

201
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,620
What do you mean by that, An?

202
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,330
I used to think

203
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,630
you were just resourceful and calculating.

204
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,690
People in the court

205
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,250
all have tact, after all.

206
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,730
But you are not right-minded.

207
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,600
You wanted to kill your brother.

208
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,950
It's not enough that you are ruthless,

209
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,080
you're also stupid.

210
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,980
How could you do such things without a trace?

211
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,150
If you don't want people to know,

212
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,540
you shouldn't do it in the first place.

213
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,740
An.

214
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,600
That's a misunderstanding.

215
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,990
Father's not been in good shape lately.

216
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,040
I didn't dare to report Zheng's illness because I was afraid he'd worry.

217
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,770
If I had known it was so serious,

218
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,210
I would have rushed to Canghe

219
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,720
and taken care of Zheng myself.

220
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,160
Jun.

221
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,150
Was it

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,550
an accidental impulse

223
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,480
or did you do it on purpose?

224
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,730
Jun.

225
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,950
Think about it.

226
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,890
Zheng and I are very much alike.

227
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,900
We're both born by concubines.

228
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,110
The only way to survive is to lie low.

229
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,050
But you came first.

230
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,600
When I had my chance,

231
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,240
you already had the upper hand.

232
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Now that you've had your chance,

233
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,810
don't say such high-sounding words.

234
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,020
Jun.

235
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,650
I'm not like you.

236
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,820
Even if it's a thorny road,

237
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,580
I will never hurt my brothers.

238
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,740
Father.

239
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,200
I know I'm wrong.

240
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,700
I came to apologize to you.

241
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,210
Please punish me.

242
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,300
Father.

243
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,720
I didn't behave myself

244
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,020
and let you down.

245
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,990
I'm willing to receive lashings and be grounded at home.

246
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,040
I'll copy the Buddhist scriptures every day

247
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,860
and pray for you and Zheng.

248
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,490
Jun.

249
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,860
I

250
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,440
underestimated you.

251
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,000
You used to follow Song.

252
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,210
You thought

253
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,020
you were following the rightful leader.

254
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,850
And I wouldn't be suspicious of you for that.

255
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,160
Being his good and loyal brother

256
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,180
would bring you closer to this palace

257
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,480
after all.

258
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,960
But Song

259
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,950
has made you bold

260
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,580
and ambitious too.

261
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,230
You were worried that Zheng would overpower you,

262
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,090
so you shut off the news

263
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,720
and intended to let Zheng die silently

264
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,990
in a closed border town?

265
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:42,800
Father.

266
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,690
I would never dare to think so.

267
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,150
Father.

268
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,590
I was just afraid

269
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,920
that your worry about Zheng

270
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,880
would hurt your health.

271
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,140
That's why I didn't dare to say anything.

272
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,960
I swear.

273
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,260
I swear.

274
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,160
It was just a momentary slip.

275
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,200
I would never intentionally kill my siblings.

276
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,490
If Zheng had died in the border town,

277
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,520
would you still say this?

278
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,890
Father, I was wrong.

279
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,670
Father, I was really wrong.

280
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,440
Father.

281
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,220
I will

282
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,720
reflect on my mistakes every day

283
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,080
and never do it again.

284
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,580
Father.

285
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,310
I've made a big mistake this time.

286
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,150
I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

287
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,980
I just ask for your punishment,

288
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,770
so that I can get slightly relieved.

289
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,260
Father.

290
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,100
Jun.

291
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,040
The reason why I have to

292
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,360
tell you these

293
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,310
is that I hope you

294
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,080
can understand my intentions.

295
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,690
I hope you're clear about

296
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,110
your fault.

297
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,620
Father.

298
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,070
Father!

299
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,330
Father!

300
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,040
Father!

301
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,710
Someone come!

302
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,040
Send for the doctor!

303
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Imperial Doctor!

304
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,410
Father!

305
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,720
Doctor!

306
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,900
Send for the doctor!

307
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,520
The Lord's illness is caused by pathogenic factors

308
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,380
and phlegm blocking the orifice.

309
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,200
It almost led to a stroke.

310
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,320
Fortunately, it was discovered in time.

311
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,650
But from today onwards,

312
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,420
you mustn't strain your mind.

313
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,320
I'll prescribe some medicine first.

314
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,470
From now on, My Lord,

315
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,930
please eat lightly,

316
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,340
avoid wind and cold

317
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,020
and take care of yourself.

318
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,460
I see.

319
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,630
Doctor Xu.

320
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:45,850
Please.

321
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,170
My Lord, you came to my palace today.

322
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,340
It means that Zhongyi Hall

323
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,530
is the safest for now.

324
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,350
Madam.

325
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,120
Be careful what you say.

326
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,520
I do feel sorry for you.

327
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,950
You have a grudge against me.

328
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,300
If you don't want to be with me,

329
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,530
go back for rest.

330
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,120
Thank you, My Lord.

331
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,110
My Lord.

332
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,770
There is something

333
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,170
I don't know if I should say.

334
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,540
Say it.

335
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,000
My Lord, you have more than ten sons.

336
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,530
Now you're sick,

337
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,060
you dare not to see any one of them.

338
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,080
You call yourself a loner

339
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,670
and has set up all the people around you.

340
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,500
Of course you can trust no one.

341
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,640
If I could go back in time,

342
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,730
I would never let my son go this far.

343
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,020
He'd just be a civilian

344
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,810
and enjoy a life of peace.

345
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,880
At least he'd not be alone.

346
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,100
The Lord hasn't been to court for seven days.

347
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,160
We have to take attendance every day

348
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,210
but can neither leave the court

349
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,240
nor see the Lord.

350
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,720
The official documents from the Ministry of Rites are piling up.

351
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
Thank you for your hard work.

352
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,680
I will forward them to the Lord.

353
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,880
Please return today.

354
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,000
With all due respect,

355
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,360
I want to ask a question.

356
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,400
I heard that the Lord won't see anyone.

357
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,090
He won't allow the Princes to attend to him either.

358
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,910
Is it true?

359
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,140
Indeed, the Lord doesn't let the Princes serve him.

360
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,560
It's because the Lord loves his children so much

361
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,090
that he's afraid to make the Princes sick too.

362
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,230
Well.

363
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,500
Chief Steward, please advise us.

364
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,000
According to the old rules,

365
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,850
at this time, we in the Ministry of Rites

366
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,040
should be preparing for the crowning ceremony of the Crown Prince.

367
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,320
Right now, should we…

368
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,150
Director Lin.

369
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,200
How dare you inquire about the Crown Prince?

370
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,920
Father is just sick.

371
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,620
And you're here to gab.

372
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,960
If you say one more word,

373
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,980
believe it or not, I'll beat you up.

374
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,450
An.

375
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,660
Calm yourself, An.

376
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,270
We're concerned

377
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,830
because we haven't seen the Lord for several days.

378
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,230
If you have the news,

379
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,890
why don't you tell us,

380
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,000
so that we can all feel relieved?

381
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,060
What news do I have?

382
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,900
Father won't see anyone.

383
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,020
I've been worried sick.

384
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,680
Director Lin is just worried.

385
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,450
The Ministry of Rites has a lot of responsibilities.

386
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,550
If they knew the news,

387
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,650
they could prepare in advance.

388
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,650
Prepare for what?

389
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,770
Are you taking precautions

390
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,760
or a move?

391
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,900
You'd better

392
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,430
put away your plan.

393
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,940
Yin Zheng.

394
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,800
Time to eat.

395
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,540
You guys can have it first.

396
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm not hungry.

397
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,570
Are you worried about the Lord?

398
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,550
Rumors are going around these days.

399
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,360
They've been saying all sorts of things.

400
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,760
Many people have asked me what my plans are.

401
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,080
Today, except for An and Yan,

402
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,770
no one really cared about the Lord.

403
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,860
I knew everyone had their thoughts.

404
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,090
But I didn't expect it

405
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,120
to be so ugly when it's taken out in public.

406
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,750
Officials come to the court and take attendance

407
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,610
for the salary.

408
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,870
They're worried that they will have no support in the future.

409
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,800
So the ugly side is revealed.

410
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,920
If everything goes well,

411
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,050
they would focus on the work.

412
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,530
It would be much easier

413
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,040
if you don't empathize with your peers.

414
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,210
And as you said,

415
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,610
there are siblings like you

416
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,250
who care about the Lord.

417
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,750
After all, you are blood relatives,

418
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,460
who are more likely to show unconditional love.

419
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,060
This is the meaning of heritage.

420
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,140
Don't worry.

421
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,050
The Lord must be able to feel your concern.

422
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,130
Let's go eat.

423
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,170
Your Highness.

424
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,820
Go to eat.

425
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,420
The congee is getting cold.

426
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,670
Liu Baoquan has sealed

427
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,520
the beef floss for the Lord.

428
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,070
But Father won't see us.

429
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,700
The Lord must have his worries

430
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,560
so that he doesn't want to see you.

431
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,940
But there is one person

432
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,010
he must want to see.

433
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,120
Get out of the way!

434
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
I can't even see my father?

435
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,380
Let me in.

436
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,030
The Lord has ordered

437
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,080
no one is allowed inside.

438
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,810
I don't care.

439
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,130
I have to see him

440
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,240
no matter how I may be punished.

441
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,930
Father.

442
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,010
Chief Steward Liang.

443
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,420
The Lord has summoned Yin Qi to see him.

444
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,620
Father.

445
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,060
Prince Qi.

446
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,230
Stop here.

447
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,560
The Imperial Doctor has instructed

448
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,270
the Lord must not catch a cold.

449
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,010
That's right.

450
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,660
Only you are willing to

451
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,160
call me “Prince” now.

452
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,470
I'm only a civilian, not worthy to face the Lord.

453
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,780
Of course, I have to greet the Lord

454
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,220
with the screen between us.

455
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,490
My Lord.

456
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,700
How is your health?

457
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,620
I'm fine.

458
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,020
Since it's fine,

459
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,730
I don't have to worry about it.

460
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,800
I dare not disturb your rest, my Lord.

461
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,590
I'll

462
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,020
take my leave.

463
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,070
Father.

464
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,680
Prince Qi, you can't come in.

465
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,600
The Lord doesn't want to see you because he's afraid you'll get sick.

466
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,160
Moreover,

467
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,440
he needs to recuperate.

468
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,130
Bullshit!

469
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,960
No son in the world has to see his father

470
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,170
through this stupid screen.

471
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,170
Get out of the way!

472
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:06,700
Father!

473
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,680
Father!

474
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,230
Father.

475
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:28,920
I know

476
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,520
you are afraid that someone will have bad intentions.

477
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,560
If your health condition is given away,

478
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,160
someone may calculate this.

479
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,480
But if someone is bold to this extent,

480
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,810
you can beat him, scold him and punish him.

481
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,510
But you can't assume everyone is the same,

482
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,580
because many people are just concerned

483
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,820
and worried about your health.

484
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,620
Father.

485
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,740
Family members

486
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,210
shouldn't be like this.

487
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,560
Your birthday

488
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,930
is next month.

489
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,540
Do you want your sons to celebrate your birthday

490
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,670
outside the screen?

491
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,590
Qi.

492
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,030
You still remember my birthday?

493
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,520
Of course I do.

494
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,070
There is no son in the world

495
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,600
who doesn't remember his father's birthday.

496
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,280
It's just

497
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,170
I'm not good enough.

498
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,830
But if Father's still willing to recognize me,

499
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,030
I will attend to you,

500
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,320
celebrate your birthday

501
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,620
and do my filial duty.

502
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,730
None of these will be missing.

503
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,890
It's all right.

504
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,780
Lord Xinchuan is sick.

505
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,440
Qi must be worried, too.

506
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,320
Although he didn't say so,

507
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,710
he was very worried.

508
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,240
He rushed back

509
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,060
as soon as he received the news.

510
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,590
The horses were exhausted.

511
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,350
So is Yin Zheng.

512
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,300
He's had a hard time sleeping and eating these days.

513
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,760
He has lost a lot of weight.

514
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,560
But fortunately, he's fine now.

515
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,270
Will you be able to stay for some days

516
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,810
this time?

517
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,480
The Lord wants Qi

518
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,610
to stay in the palace for a longer time.

519
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,620
So we're not in a hurry to leave.

520
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,580
I also want him

521
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,630
to spend more time with his father.

522
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,120
You two?

523
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,530
Did you and Qi…

524
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:22,950
I knew it.

525
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,200
You knew it.

526
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,320
Don't just talk about me.

527
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,180
What about you?

528
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,960
Have you made up your mind

529
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,170
to stay in Xinchuan?

530
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,030
But I'm still worried.

531
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,620
I've never even been the chief of a town before.

532
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,950
Now I have to manage so many things at once.

533
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,450
But I also

534
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,320
feel relieved as long as Yin Zheng is here.

535
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,610
Tell me

536
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,540
about the story of you two going out in the world.

537
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,850
You've been to so many places.

538
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,960
I have never been there.

539
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,020
If I had the chance,

540
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,220
I would also like to travel the world on the horseback.

541
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,460
On the horseback?

542
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,860
Do you know how to ride a horse?

543
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:04,810
I don't.

544
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,220
But I can learn.

545
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:06,920
Master.

546
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,850
You can teach me.

547
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,370
Let me

548
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,449
think about it.

549
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,290
Master, thank you.

550
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:25,800
Here.

551
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,000
Qi doesn't seem to be very good on horseback.

552
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:31,760
Not very good.

553
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,690
He's too stupid.

554
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,530
[Ten days later]

555
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,530
Father is finally feeling better these days.

556
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,840
As sons, it's a relief

557
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,600
we can look after you.

558
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,159
I've made you worry

559
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,469
these days.

560
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,920
As long as Father can recover,

561
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,679
it's worth it

562
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,400
even if we can't sleep every day out of worry.

563
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,450
Father's body has not yet recovered,

564
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,110
so you can't have meat or fish.

565
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,130
But you can't have malnutrition either.

566
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,110
Li Wei said congee with meat floss is good for your body and appetite.

567
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:13,910
Try it.

568
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,380
Meat floss?

569
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,720
Let me try it.

570
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,070
I've been having bland congee

571
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,870
for several days in a row.

572
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,660
This stuff is really good.

573
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,690
After so many days, the Lord's appetite has finally arisen.

574
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,040
How to make meat floss?

575
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,700
Looks good.

576
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,790
Give me some later.

577
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,870
I'll give you a cow.

578
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,240
That's very considerate of you, Zheng.

579
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,180
Thank Li Wei for me too.

580
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:57,930
By the way,

581
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,720
take the message

582
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,630
that on the fifth day of next month,

583
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,090
I'll make Li Wei the wife of Prince Zheng.

584
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,260
Thank you, Father.

585
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,690
Look at you.

586
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,980
I've rewarded you with many good things.

587
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,510
But it's the first time I've seen you so happy.

588
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,060
Father.

589
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,590
The most precious thing to Zheng is Li Wei.

590
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,970
Now that you've finally agreed,

591
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,030
he must be so happy.

592
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,810
I like my sister-in-law, Li Wei.

593
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,870
I'm happy too.

594
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,840
You're happy too.

595
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,730
Happy.

596
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,880
Prince Jun is here with his wife.

597
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,700
Let them in.

598
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,860
Good day, My Lord.

599
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,160
You're so pregnant.

600
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,170
You should be at home, nursing the baby.

601
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,670
Why did you come out?

602
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,080
I'm sorry for your concern.

603
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,620
The baby in my belly is well-behaved.

604
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,100
It's not hard for me to go around.

605
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,520
I heard that you're feeling better

606
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,040
and allow others to visit you.

607
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,720
So I and Prince Jun must come.

608
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,650
Jun.

609
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,750
You are new parents.

610
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,380
How can you be so ignorant of priorities?

611
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,040
Father is right.

612
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,420
I will take good care of them.

613
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,250
It's just

614
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,290
the baby will be full-term.

615
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,700
I wanted to come and pay our respects first,

616
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,430
so that Father can feel at ease.

617
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,010
Take care of them,

618
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,610
in case anything goes wrong.

619
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,980
I will follow your advice.

620
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,070
Since Father is fine,

621
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,680
I and Xiyuan will leave first.

622
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,900
Let's continue.

623
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,700
Come on.

624
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,520
Let's eat.

625
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,590
Jun is going to be a father soon.

626
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,520
You should hurry up too.

627
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,130
Especially you, Qi.

628
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,880
I haven't seen you for so long.

629
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,900
I thought

630
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,690
you and Princess Shangguan

631
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,020
would have good news this time.

632
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:20,500
Mother.

633
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,550
It's not convenient for us in the outside world.

634
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,880
Besides, us coming back

635
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,870
is also good news.

636
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,400
Isn't it?

637
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,670
It is.

638
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,650
But we're all looking forward to our grandchildren.

639
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,390
Hurry up.

640
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,030
Yes.

641
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,050
The main thing is,

642
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,090
Qi, you have to overcome the problems.

643
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,750
You too, An.

644
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,610
Okay.

645
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,310
You should all hurry up.

646
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,180
[Be humble and learn and always encourage yourself]

647
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,330
We can't wait any longer.

648
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,740
We need some midwives to think of a way for us.

649
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,740
This child

650
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,930
must be born on the same day as the Lord.

651
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,850
Nanny said

652
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,910
you're not strong enough.

653
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,320
It's dangerous to keep the baby until it's full term.

654
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,050
If you force the birth like this,

655
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,710
I'm afraid you'll damage your health even more.

656
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,350
I can nurse my body.

657
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,960
It can always get better.

658
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,440
This child

659
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,120
is going to be born in our family.

660
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,610
Then he is a member of Prince Jun's family.

661
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,480
He has the responsibility to fight for the future with us.

662
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,380
No way.

663
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,490
It's too dangerous.

664
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,690
I can't let you take any risks.

665
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,580
These are not the most important.

666
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,400
Even the Lord's scruples are nothing now.

667
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,650
As long as this child is the eldest grandson,

668
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,920
he'll have exceptional status.

669
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,380
That's the most important thing.

670
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,510
But have you thought

671
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,010
what if it's not a boy?

672
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,870
There's no “what if”. It has to be.

673
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,090
If he's not a boy,

674
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,620
I'll make him a boy.

675
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,720
Don't feel reserved.

676
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,380
Just say it.

677
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,190
Yes.

678
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,930
My Lord, you're mostly healed.

679
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,480
You just need to recuperate in the next six months

680
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,230
and don't exert yourself.

681
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,940
I'm just getting a bit weak

682
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,460
after the illness.

683
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,460
But I'm not that weak.

684
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,830
Why do I have to drink medicine every day?

685
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,120
Father, you've just recovered from your illness.

686
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,470
It's better to follow the doctor's advice.

687
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,270
But Doctor Xu,

688
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,560
today is the Lord's birthday,

689
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,810
can you give him a day's grace

690
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,560
before resuming the diet?

691
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:04,980
Yes.

692
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,100
Please remember not to drink alcohol.

693
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,480
Doctor Xu.

694
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,790
Now that I'm free from the diet, I'm not allowed to drink.

695
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,150
You have to restrict me on one thing.

696
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,780
Reporting!

697
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,890
I'll leave now.

698
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,150
My Lord.

699
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,190
Prince Jun's lady has given birth to a baby boy.

700
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,250
Congratulations.

701
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,540
It's said it was almost time.

702
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,260
I didn't expect it to be today.

703
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,060
Congratulations to the Lord.

704
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,740
My Lord,

705
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,890
Prince Jun is afraid to bother the Lord

706
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,100
and came by with the child.

707
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,830
He is waiting outside the hall.

708
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,010
Let him in.

709
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,600
Prince Jun is invited.

710
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,610
My Lord, I congratulate you on your birthday.

711
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,440
My wife's honored

712
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,680
to have given birth to the eldest grandson of Xinchuan.

713
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,640
May the Lord live long and prosper.

714
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,970
Wish peace and security for Xinchuan.

715
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,340
What a blessing!

716
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,080
I was told the birth would be in half a month.

717
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,740
I didn't expect my first nephew

718
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,490
to be so smart

719
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,770
and be born on the same day as Father.

720
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,900
He looks so lucky.

721
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,870
Bring the baby over.

722
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,260
He's so cute.

723
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,190
Here, cover it.

724
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,260
You're a father now.

725
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,040
The child has just been born.

726
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,590
Don't take him out.

727
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:53,550
Yes.

728
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,800
I just want Father to see his eldest grandson as soon as possible.

729
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,430
By the way,

730
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,910
I beg your grace

731
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,380
to give the eldest grandson a name.

732
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,460
Take the child home first.

733
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,820
Take good care of him.

734
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,670
I'll think about

735
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,140
the naming thing.

736
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,600
Yes.

737
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:30,960
My Lord.

738
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,940
This is from Prince Zheng.

739
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,330
He said it's cold lately.

740
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,860
He put dates on the edge of the mat

741
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,140
and mugwort inside.

742
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,540
It can stay warm for a couple of hours.

743
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,930
That's very considerate of Zheng.

744
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,420
Good.

745
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,040
The Ministry of Revenue

746
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,140
has fulfilled its duty in the past few days,

747
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,480
but not carefully.

748
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,430
Jun's paid attention elsewhere.

749
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,110
[Presented by Ministry of Rites]

750
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,990
The Ministry of Rites

751
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,160
has already prepared a letter to request the enfeoffment of the eldest grandson.

752
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,130
The moment he was born,

753
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,850
the letter was handed over.

754
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,190
The ink had been dried for many days.

755
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,750
Doctor Xu has instructed.

756
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,820
My Lord should not be distracted.

757
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,230
These documents are not urgent.

758
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,920
Affairs in the court cannot be delayed.

759
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,480
Once delayed,

760
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,970
the documents will pile up.

761
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,420
Besides,

762
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,700
how can I know

763
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,460
what they are planning

764
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,560
without these?

765
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,410
Liang Shi.

766
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,200
Yes.

767
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,660
What year did you enter the palace?

768
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,890
I entered the palace when I was nine years old.

769
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,860
At the age of eleven, I served in the Prince's court.

770
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,930
That's when I followed you.

771
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,840
It's been a long time.

772
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
You've grown old.

773
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,000
I've grown old too.

774
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,360
Recently, when I look at these sons,

775
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm reminded of my younger days.

776
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,030
I'm out of my depth anyway.

777
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,740
The children are all grown up.

778
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,480
They can work on their own.

779
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,650
After the sickness,

780
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,040
my ideas have been straightened out.

781
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,980
Some decisions

782
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,450
don't really matter.

783
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,240
I have to choose anyway.

784
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,150
I should choose the best one

785
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,350
whose heart is with the people.

786
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,920
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

787
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,150
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

788
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,650
♫A gust of wind blows♫

789
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,120
♫And stops by my ear♫

790
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,410
♫The moon shines♫

791
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,710
♫In my heart♫

792
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,280
♫Your smiles are all over♫

793
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,920
♫Gradually I am used to♫

794
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,840
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

795
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,550
♫I don't dare to get related♫

796
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,660
♫But you came to me♫

797
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,320
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫

798
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:15,020
♫I don't know what to say. I am so excited♫

799
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,820
♫But you can tell what is in my heart with your eyes♫

800
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,510
♫The road is long. Luckily, I have you♫

801
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:29,830
♫In rivers and mountains, let's appreciate the smoke rising♫

802
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,900
♫The past is gone with the sunrise♫

803
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,580
♫The warmth in your palm is in my heart♫

804
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,270
♫Let's share the light in wind, snow, and coldness♫

805
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:50,560
♫I am relieved when you are with me♫

806
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,200
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

807
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,540
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

808
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,800
♫A gust of wind blows♫

809
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,220
♫And stops by my ear♫

810
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,610
♫The moon shines♫

811
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,920
♫In my heart♫

812
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,860
♫Your smiles are all over♫

813
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:42,190
♫Gradually I am used to♫

814
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:47,010
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

815
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,060
♫I don't dare to get related♫

816
