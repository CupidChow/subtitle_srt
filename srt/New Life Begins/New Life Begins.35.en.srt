[Episode 35]

4
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,570
While you were away from home,

5
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,910
a few more ladies of ministers came.

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,650
I treated them well.

7
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,120
I can always trust your competence in every mission.

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360
More people in the court are getting supportive of you

9
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,520
and connecting with you.

10
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,660
Don't worry.

11
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,500
I've told them

12
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,980
to keep it quiet.

13
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,030
Good.

14
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,970
From what happened to Song,

15
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,550
Father appreciates practical people.

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,880
Although I've got some support,

17
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,410
Yin Zheng

18
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,250
is tough to deal with.

19
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,990
We have to wait for the right opportunity.

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,180
Actually,

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,620
we have one more leverage.

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,470
What is it?

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,110
How long have you been pregnant?

24
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,840
Four months.

25
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,800
I wait till it's steady to tell you.

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,660
And I've asked a midwife about it.

27
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,630
She said

28
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,710
it looked like a boy.

29
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,329
Really?

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,370
Is she

31
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,510
good at this?

32
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,640
Xiyuan.

33
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,380
Don't worry.

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,050
Our firstborn son must be legitimate.

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,620
What I promised you

36
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,820
will never change.

37
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,290
Thanks to Li Wei for arranging these dishes.

38
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,610
The food smells so good.

39
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,630
Thank you, Lady Wei.

40
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,450
This is what I should do.

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Then let's dig in.

42
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,340
Come on, dig in.

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,360
Why isn't Xiyuan here?

44
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,470
Maybe she's held back on the way.

45
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,800
She should be here soon.

46
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,740
Lady Xiyuan is here.

47
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,490
Speak of the devil.

48
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,040
Sorry, I'm late.

49
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,060
Please excuse me, Madam He, Madam Chun.

50
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,760
I guess you were held back on the way.

51
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,450
It's all right.

52
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,370
Please sit down.

53
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,500
Thank you, Madam He.

54
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,230
It's not really about the journey.

55
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,660
It's just that I've always been weak.

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,220
And now that I'm pregnant,

57
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,900
I have to be more careful.

58
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,350
That's why I'm late.

59
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
You're pregnant?

60
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,810
Yes.

61
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,020
Just four months.

62
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,090
I thought

63
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,970
I'd tell you when it got safe.

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,409
That's great.

65
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,940
How is your condition?

66
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,960
Any discomfort?

67
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
The doctor is taking good care of me.

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
I don't feel anything wrong.

69
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,370
But

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,800
the dishes smell…

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,540
The dishes are greasy.

72
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,630
Take them away.

73
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,140
Replace them with lighter dishes.

74
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,930
Yes, Madam.

75
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,840
Quickly.

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,700
Take them down.

77
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:52,980
Come on.

78
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,680
Have some food.

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,450
Xiyuan.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
I didn't know

81
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,050
you were pregnant.

82
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,140
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,380
It's okay.

84
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,080
You’re not to blame if you didn’t know.

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,040
It's my fault for being weak.

86
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Come on, then.

87
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,330
Let's eat.

88
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,850
Come on.

89
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,390
Big deal.

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,940
Eat.

91
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Have some of this.

92
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,920
Thank you, Madam Chun.

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,240
This is great.

94
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,480
Now Xiyuan is carrying a baby too.

95
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,070
Prince Yan's wife

96
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,420
is still young.

97
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:30,800
Li Wei.

98
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,380
How come there is no sign of your pregnancy?

99
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,000
I and Zheng agreed to talk about it later.

100
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,240
Let's go with the kids.

101
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
There's no hurry.

102
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,600
A cold disaster has struck the border of Xinchuan and Cangchuan.

103
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,590
If you have any thoughts on disaster relief,

104
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,060
you may speak freely.

105
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,100
My Lord.

106
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,870
The cold disaster in the northwest is rare in a hundred years.

107
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,250
The priority is to avoid casualties.

108
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,560
The Ministry of Revenue has already prepared the funds.

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,490
But if we send supplies from the capital of Xinchuan,

110
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,750
I'm afraid it's too far to travel.

111
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,690
We must seek help from nearby.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,840
The northern part of Mochuan has experience in fighting the cold.

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm sure they can help.

114
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,330
[The priority is to avoid casualties and seek help from Mochuan.]

115
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,040
Zheng is too busy with foreign affairs. He can be negligent.

116
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,390
I have to say one more thing.

117
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,700
The Nine Regions Affairs Division

118
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,080
must send letters to Mochuan and Jichuan to ask for help.

119
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,300
My Lord.

120
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,940
I've written to Prince Kun.

121
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,200
He and Mochuan have agreed

122
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,440
that Mochuan will provide livestock and coats.

123
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
But the five towns in the northwest need charcoal,

124
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,000
I've persuaded Daichuan to send help from nearby

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,060
who will provide charcoal and grain.

126
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,090
Good.

127
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,400
That's very considerate, Prince Zheng.

128
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,550
Cangchuan has suffered a lot.

129
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,670
I've heard many cattle and sheep have frozen to death.

130
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,400
That's true.

131
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,010
Cangchuan is already barren.

132
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,110
And it's been hit by a disaster.

133
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,590
If we don't help in time,

134
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,230
they might have to sell their children.

135
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,890
Luckily, Prince Jun is in charge of the Ministry of Revenue.

136
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,020
The relief money is already prepared.

137
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,080
That's right.

138
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,840
The ministry counts on Your Highness's planning.

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
You flattered me.

140
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,409
It's part of my job.

141
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,320
Gentlemen.

142
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,020
Please.

143
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,390
Please, Prince.

144
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,220
Zheng.

145
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,430
If you need someone,

146
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,220
I'll be there for you.

147
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,669
It's getting colder.

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
The tea is getting cold fast.

149
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,250
I'm afraid the people of the five towns in the northwest

150
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,380
can't even get a sip of hot tea.

151
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
The Lord's heart is with the people.

152
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,190
I'm sure they'll benefit from your blessing

153
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,700
and get through this.

154
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,280
That's enough.

155
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,610
Such flattering words.

156
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,640
But

157
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,510
it's easy to say.

158
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,390
Whoever benefits the people

159
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,580
is a doer.

160
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,710
Since Jun took over the Ministry of Revenue,

161
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,850
I seem to see the younger me.

162
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,630
I underestimated him.

163
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,440
Zheng looks sincere.

164
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,840
But sometimes he makes me feel

165
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,310
that he's unpredictable.

166
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,240
Go and deliver the decree.

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,170
Tell them both

168
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,990
to go to the Northwest for disaster relief.

169
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,500
If people get frozen to death,

170
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,270
they don't have to come back to see me.

171
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:56,990
Yes.

172
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,690
Be careful.

173
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,290
How's that?

174
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:07,950
Nice.

175
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,410
It looks good.

176
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,070
Does it fit?

177
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,680
Although the sole looks thick,

178
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,610
it's very light.

179
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,380
So I decided to call it “A thousand miles of a journey”.

180
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,840
A thousand miles of a journey?

181
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,220
Her Ladyship went to the Department of Internal Affairs

182
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,520
and chose the lightest material.

183
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,720
She also put tung oil on the soles of the shoes,

184
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,920
so they won't get wet in the rain or snow.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,710
This is…

186
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,730
I call it

187
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,680
“Instant meal”.

188
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,800
The seasonings are ground into powder.

189
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,520
Mix it with oil,

190
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,850
wait for it to get lumpy,

191
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,040
and put it in a bowl.

192
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,560
With some hot water,

193
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,000
it melts into soup.

194
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:43,820
See?

195
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,390
This method is suitable for disaster relief.

196
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,890
Haitang was worried about the situation in Cangchuan.

197
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,290
So we made this together.

198
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,110
I'll write the recipe for you later.

199
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,440
You just need to tell your men to follow it,

200
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,840
so I don't have to worry about you starving.

201
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,740
This is a great help.

202
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Don't just focus on your work there.

203
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,830
Take care of yourself.

204
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,570
No matter what happens,

205
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,360
write to me.

206
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,100
You get it?

207
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,090
Don't worry.

208
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,270
As long as I'm still breathing,

209
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,330
I will write to you.

210
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,260
Don't say that.

211
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,730
Lady Wei.

212
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,730
Lady Wei.

213
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,040
It's Concubine Wei.

214
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,680
The Prince has said

215
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,210
we can call you that at home.

216
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,790
The Prince is leaving tomorrow.

217
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,250
Are you still sleeping in your room tonight?

218
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,170
Your Highness.

219
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,180
It's my fault.

220
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,280
I was careless.

221
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,090
The quilt on Her Ladyship's bed got wet.

222
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,200
How would you like to...

223
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,800
It's okay.

224
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,370
Get another one.

225
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,760
There can't be another one.

226
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,820
The warehouse is leaking.

227
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,860
The rain happened to wet the quilts.

228
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
Am I right, Butler Su?

229
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,620
That's right.

230
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,450
It's all wet.

231
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,440
It's all soaked.

232
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,080
That's right.

233
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,760
It's rancid.

234
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,440
Tell me about it.

235
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,540
Where should Her Ladyship go to sleep?

236
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:57,870
Yes.

237
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,160
Your Highness.

238
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,130
Do you have

239
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,270
a simpler way?

240
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,790
Take mine.

241
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,040
That's enough. Don't think about it.

242
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,240
I'll just have to bundle up.

243
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,890
Let's go.

244
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,760
Go to sleep.

245
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,180
Your Ladyship.

246
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,800
He...

247
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,680
Are you still trying to figure it out?

248
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,500
She's left.

249
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,250
Your Highness.

250
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,870
If you knew what you've missed tonight,

251
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,710
I'm sure you'd regret it.

252
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,950
Think about it.

253
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,210
Just think about it.

254
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,670
Now that the new currency is common at the border,

255
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,630
I've prepared 15,000 taels for Your Highness.

256
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,110
If you need to pay for anything,

257
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,020
just use it.

258
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,760
I will also call for donations

259
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,490
and set an example for the Lord.

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
You are now pregnant.

261
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,920
You shouldn't do these things.

262
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,850
But I can't rest assured

263
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,280
leaving these to others.

264
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,480
I'm sure Your Highness understands

265
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,680
what the Lord means about this journey.

266
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,130
As long as the officials of the five towns

267
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,850
think you've done a better job

268
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,410
and overshadowed Zheng.

269
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,140
The Lord will make a decision in his mind.

270
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,740
How could I have been able to marry you?

271
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,010
It's my fortune.

272
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,130
I'm a concubine's daughter.

273
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,810
I don't have a good family background.

274
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,620
I wouldn't have been able to make the main wife

275
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,530
at the election.

276
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,720
But I decided to fight for myself.

277
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,960
So I met with Your Highness privately.

278
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,760
And I didn't expect to be blessed by your kindness.

279
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,540
You handed me a handkerchief,

280
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,150
saying you wanted me to choose you

281
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,920
because you would help me in the future.

282
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,070
I was wondering,

283
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
how bold was she

284
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,660
to say that?

285
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,840
But I'd taken the handkerchief.

286
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,450
I had to fight for you.

287
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,920
I still remember that at the wedding ceremony,

288
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,990
Yue laughed at you

289
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,270
for fighting for a nobody.

290
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,860
You'd never been in trouble with the legitimate princes.

291
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,780
But that day,

292
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,110
you told Yue

293
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,220
that he should respectfully call me his sister-in-law.

294
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,400
I thought to myself,

295
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,440
no matter what this man wanted

296
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,780
in the future,

297
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,660
I must help him get it.

298
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:27,880
Jun.

299
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,520
Zheng.

300
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
If you've had a good rest,

301
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,120
why don't we set out now?

302
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,020
It won't take long to get to Wuxiang from here.

303
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,240
We can make it in time.

304
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,220
Let the soldiers have a good rest.

305
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,200
Although Wuxiang got the worst hit,

306
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,130
it gets the most attention.

307
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,190
It's not a problem.

308
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,630
On the other hand, few people pay attention to

309
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,590
the remote Canghe Town.

310
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,120
How about we…

311
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,550
Zheng.

312
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,720
How can we help the victims

313
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,450
if we don't have enough energy?

314
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,850
We're there to send help.

315
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,440
If we get to the northwest, all exhausted,

316
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,170
I don't think we can be helpful.

317
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,920
Besides,

318
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,430
Wuxiang is an important town.

319
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,160
The Lord is concerned about it.

320
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,010
If you have to go to the remote Canghe Town,

321
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,250
wouldn't that be putting the cart before the horse?

322
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,050
You're right.

323
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,650
I was being inconsiderate.

324
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,940
But the disaster is serious.

325
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,940
Please forgive me for going ahead.

326
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,060
Gentlemen.

327
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,460
Canghe Town is remote

328
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,210
with a lack of supplies.

329
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,350
It's as severe as in several major towns.

330
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,870
But few people pay attention to it.

331
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,120
The people there need our help more urgently.

332
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,980
If anyone is willing to go with me,

333
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,240
I will take my allowance as a subsidy.

334
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,770
2,000 copper coins per day.

335
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,030
If not,

336
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I won't force you.

337
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,580
Prince Zheng.

338
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,840
I'd like to go with you.

339
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,510
I do.

340
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,200
I do too.

341
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,740
We do too.

342
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,700
Thank you.

343
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,140
Let's send the soup base to Cangchuan.

344
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,900
It should be able to solve some urgent problems.

345
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,829
Haitang, don't get too worried.

346
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,930
Shangguan and Yin Qi will be arriving in Cangchuan soon.

347
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,030
They can also help resettle the refugees.

348
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,290
Yuan Ying has arranged Jinchuan to send food to Cangchuan.

349
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,800
Thanks to their help.

350
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,730
Yes.

351
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,560
By the way,

352
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,450
Xiyuan has started

353
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,160
collecting donations.

354
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,420
I checked out the list.

355
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,700
It's all for Xinchuan

356
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,800
and can't cover Cangchuan.

357
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,960
Why don't we raise some money too

358
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,470
and send it to Cangchuan?

359
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,240
Speaking of donations,

360
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,410
there's a perfect person for that.

361
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,480
It's time to open his purse.

362
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,830
Hurry up.

363
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,620
Don't rush.

364
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
It's nearly done.

365
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,850
Lord Cangchuan has already asked for help.

366
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,380
Father will take care of it.

367
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,680
Is it done?

368
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,110
Yes.

369
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,010
Right away.

370
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:17,670
All set.

371
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,760
I'm taking care of

372
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,200
Cangchuan disaster relief this time.

373
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,320
Everything will be submitted and approved in a simple manner,

374
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,380
so that the relief money can reach Cangchuan in no time.

375
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,080
You see?

376
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,890
I've put down the amount.

377
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,360
I've also put down what you two donated.

378
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,140
You only donated 3,000 taels since you have so many stores?

379
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,600
What do you mean by “only”?

380
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,200
It's worth half-a-lifetime salary.

381
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
You don't depend on your salary.

382
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,410
You're so…

383
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,800
Don't complain about being hard up.

384
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,060
Truly poor people don't get to complain.

385
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,150
Cangchuan was severely affected

386
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,550
by the freeze.

387
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,950
My family has an official position, so it's not affected.

388
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,730
Many people in the family make a living by growing begonias.

389
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,390
They've lost all their money.

390
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,190
Even the Dong family is like this.

391
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,470
Let alone ordinary people.

392
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,770
Haitang.

393
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,550
Don't be so sad.

394
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,500
What can we do?

395
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,320
After all, this is our family's business.

396
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,620
How can others care about it?

397
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,400
This is meager.

398
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,860
I'll add it.

399
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,120
Thirty-five thousand taels.

400
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,980
Is that enough?

401
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,670
Haitang.

402
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,270
Don't be anxious.

403
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,870
Listen.

404
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,000
When spring starts,

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,760
I'll send some money to my father-in-law,

406
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,660
so that he can plant some high-quality saplings

407
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,160
and give them to my eldest brother-in-law,

408
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,650
middle brother-in-law,

409
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,400
and youngest brother-in-law.

410
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,030
All of my brothers-in-law can be covered.

411
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,320
Thank you for your kindness.

412
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,850
I can take care of my family's business.

413
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,050
Don't worry about it.

414
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,400
As for the money for disaster relief,

415
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,680
I should thank you for the people of Cangchuan.

416
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,610
And I'll take it.

417
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,730
I should thank the gratitude from Cangchuan people.

418
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,370
My 30,000 taels are gone so quickly.

419
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,660
So quickly?

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,080
[Canghe Town, Juncture of Xinchuan and Cangchuan]

00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,580
[Canghe Town]

422
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,980
Be careful.

[Canghe Town, Chief Du]

424
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,960
Your Highness,

425
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,680
I've been counting the grain in the storehouse,

426
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,010
so I didn't get to welcome you.

427
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,070
Please forgive me.

428
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,650
My fellow villagers.

429
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,110
This is…

430
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,160
Don't make it known.

431
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,370
I'm here for disaster relief.

432
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,700
There is no prince here.

433
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,720
Then…

434
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,990
Then I'll call you “Gentleman”.

435
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,650
Chief Du, right?

436
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,770
That's right.

437
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,400
I've heard of your hard work.

438
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,000
Thank you.

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,980
Squire Lin.

440
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,570
Distribute the supplies.

441
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:35,830
Yes.

442
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,430
People.

443
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,450
Come and get your supplies.

444
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,220
Come on.

445
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,990
Unload the truck.

446
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,990
Unload the truck.

447
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,650
What a kind person.

448
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,710
Thank you.

449
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,630
Gentleman,

450
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,650
why are the soldiers hauling the supplies up the mountain?

451
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,460
The road is frosty and the horseshoes are slippery.

452
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,920
The fleet couldn't get in.

453
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,740
I thought it would be serious.

454
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,000
But I didn't expect it to be this serious.

455
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,080
That's right.

456
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,610
This place is remote.

457
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,650
The nearest county gets the quickest relief.

458
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,030
Now there's neither enough food,

459
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,610
nor enough herbs.

460
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,300
I really wouldn't know what to do

461
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,760
if you didn't make it here.

462
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,580
Don't worry.

463
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,110
I've asked someone to cut the ice and make a way.

464
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,310
As long as the carriages can get in,

465
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,550
everything will be fine.

466
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,680
That would be great.

467
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,860
But I came in a hurry.

468
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,430
I don't have enough supplies.

469
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,380
We'll have to think of another way.

470
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,800
Please tell me about the remaining food.

471
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,830
Let's go to the resting place.

472
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,260
Good.

473
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,050
Come with me.

474
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,080
I didn't expect the capital to send someone here.

475
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,330
We don't have a decent place for you to stay.

476
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,190
These two rooms

477
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,890
were built when Magistrate Chu came to visit.

478
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,830
Since we're here to provide relief,

479
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,160
it's enough to have a place to write.

480
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,820
No problem.

481
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,700
But…

482
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,080
I'll have a chair sent over later.

483
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,200
A usual one would be fine.

484
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,790
Let's get down to business.

485
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:35,670
You see?

486
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,940
This is it?

487
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,750
Yes.

488
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,490
There are more victims in Wuxiang County.

489
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,620
Things are being sent there in a hurry.

490
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,010
We have no choice.

491
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,310
Gentleman.

492
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,630
You won't…

493
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,600
You won't leave us alone, right?

494
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,400
Of course not.

495
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,040
Since I'm here,

496
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,510
I have to solve problems for the villagers.

497
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,810
Well…

498
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,450
I'll go and get a table myself.

499
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,670
Take your time.

500
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,320
Did you get a letter from His Highness?

501
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,690
You have to ask 800 times a day.

502
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,220
Lady Wei.

503
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,330
I told you not to call me that.

504
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:22,810
Yes.

505
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,360
Why hasn't he written yet?

506
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,470
Someone must be badmouthing me behind my back.

507
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,680
He may be missing you.

508
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,380
Missing me?

509
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,190
Then why doesn't he write back?

510
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,850
It's only been a few days.

511
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,900
It takes some time to get to the northwest border.

512
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,220
It'll take another trip

513
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,470
to write a letter and have it sent back by post.

514
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,690
So it takes some time.

515
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,710
Lady Wei.

516
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,160
Why do you call me Lady too?

517
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,940
Don't ever call me that again.

518
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,480
Yes.

519
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,500
I'll be careful.

520
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,340
Lady Xiyuan

521
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,550
is arranging for donations for the victims.

522
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,550
We've been asked.

523
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,590
How much do you think we should donate?

524
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,120
It's an official affair for her to fundraise.

525
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,170
Let's see how much Madam He donates

526
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,370
and we'll donate 10% less than she does.

527
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,430
But no one knows about the money

528
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,110
you and Lady Haitang donated.

529
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,810
Why don't we also publicize it?

530
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,210
Right?

531
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,250
Yes.

532
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,590
It's just a token of kindness.

533
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,930
If we're raising money to show it off,

534
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm afraid it won't help much.

535
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,140
Instead, people will take it the wrong way.

536
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,010
Yes.

537
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,010
You're right.

538
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,370
But Lady Xiyuan

539
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,130
is spreading the word everywhere

540
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,700
that Prince Jun made her do that,

541
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,130
defending Prince Jun's name.

542
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,810
She even said he wrote back

543
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,060
to tell her to do it.

544
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,580
Isn't that infuriating?

545
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,230
Prince Jun has written to Lady Xiyuan?

546
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,410
How come there's no news from Yin Zheng?

547
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,840
Could something have happened to him?

548
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,600
He has no one around to help him.

549
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,120
I'll go check out if there's a letter from him.

550
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,850
Your Ladyship.

551
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,900
I've checked it.

552
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,620
Nothing yet.

553
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,170
Perhaps His Highness is busy.

554
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,620
You checked it a while ago.

555
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,020
Maybe it’s sent here now.

556
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,950
Butler Su

557
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,270
had to say too much.

558
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,650
It's okay. There's no hurry.

559
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,570
You're all covered.

560
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,300
-Line up. -You're all covered.

00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,290
Let's not be in a hurry.

563
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,180
Everyone has a share.

564
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,750
Slowly.

565
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,440
Move to the front.

566
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,390
Take your time.

567
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:23,750
Auntie.

568
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,310
Those who get it should walk backward.

569
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,130
You're all covered.

570
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,600
Don't crowd.

571
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,200
Watch out.

572
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,480
Watch out.

573
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,020
Okay.

574
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,050
Thank you, gentleman.

575
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:42,990
Gentleman.

576
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,950
These are "A thousand miles of journey" shoes.

577
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,870
They're better for walking.

578
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,390
Make some according to this.

579
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,360
Distribute them.

580
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,430
And make smaller sizes for the children.

581
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,730
Otherwise, their feet can get a cold injury.

582
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,010
Yes.

583
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,070
Gentleman.

584
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,060
Help.

585
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,750
Gentleman.

586
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,260
Granny.

587
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,590
Where is the gentleman?

588
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,050
Gentleman.

589
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,510
Granny.

590
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,530
No hurry.

591
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,540
Granny.

592
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,200
My husband was long gone.

593
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm a blind old woman left behind.

594
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,970
My son is not at home.

595
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,970
I live with my granddaughter.

596
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,520
There is no food.

597
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,780
The windows are broken by the cold wind.

598
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,420
My granddaughter is crying from the cold.

599
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,280
Granny.

600
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,490
Don't drag the gentleman.

601
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,550
It doesn't matter.

602
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,480
What do you need at home?

603
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,990
Food.

604
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,610
Quilts, bedding.

605
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,980
And clothes.

606
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,190
Gentleman.

607
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:35,780
Okay.

608
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,440
I'll send it over.

609
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,420
Thank you.

610
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,710
Thank you, Gentleman.

611
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,780
Thank you.

612
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:42,770
Watch out.

613
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,610
Wait.

614
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,740
Gentleman.

615
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,350
You…

616
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,300
Gentleman.

617
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
I can't take this.

618
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,800
No.

619
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,090
It's not warm, but it can protect against the wind.

620
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:53,550
Take it.

621
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,730
Thank you, Gentleman.

622
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,450
Thank you, Gentleman.

623
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,130
Watch out.

624
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,010
Watch out.

625
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,280
Thank you.

626
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,290
I've met a great man today.

627
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,370
Chief.

628
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,920
Take the family register and check the situation.

629
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,840
If it's true,

630
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,890
bring some children's clothes there

631
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,870
and seal the windows.

632
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,400
Yes, sir.

633
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,230
Gentleman.

634
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,540
It's cold.

635
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,530
You should go back to your room.

636
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,210
The palace is kept in mink fur and silver bone charcoal.

637
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,670
I don't dare say it's cold.

638
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,500
Go on ahead.

639
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,230
Yes.

640
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,930
[Juncture of Xinchuan and Cangchuan, Wuxiang Town]

641
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,700
Thank you, Prince Jun.

642
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,590
Prince Jun.

643
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,120
The West and North Cities are the most affected.

644
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,490
South City, where the government offices are located, is intact.

645
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,090
There is no shortage of food.

646
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,710
But there is still a shortage of charcoal in North City.

647
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,340
We'll send some there soon.

648
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,910
But

649
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,220
we didn't bring much charcoal from the capital.

650
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,190
Distribute it

651
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,250
according to clan name.

652
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:19,810
Yes.

653
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,360
This will be recorded

654
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,770
on the gazette.

655
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,020
Prince Jun donated

656
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,290
all his charcoal.

657
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,340
You!

658
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,770
Prince Jun.

659
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,040
South City still needs some warm clothes.

660
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,010
I see.

661
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,210
I'll make someone send it as well.

662
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,510
But I've taken stock of the storehouse.

663
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,080
I'm afraid we don't have enough warm clothes.

664
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,330
Not enough?

665
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,440
Inequality is worse than scarcity.

666
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,930
There is enough cloth, right?

667
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,360
Yes.

668
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,390
So

669
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,090
take out the lint from the warm clothes

670
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,610
and double the amount.

671
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,400
Ensure that everyone has clothes.

672
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,210
In any case, no one should freeze to death.

673
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,070
Yes.

674
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,020
Prince Zheng cares about the people

675
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,950
and handles everything personally.

676
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,330
I will report it to the Lord.

677
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,930
You've done a great job too, Magistrate Chu.

678
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,060
I'm sure you'll prosper in the future.

679
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,910
Excuse me, Your Highness.

680
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:45,710
Come in.

681
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,790
Your Highness.

682
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,700
How's it going?

683
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,240
Has the ice on the road been cleared?

684
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,530
Yes.

685
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,520
But I heard from the woodcutters in the mountains

686
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,430
that there was a group of gangsters

687
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,830
around Canghe.

688
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,430
They've taken over the mountains and robbed.

689
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,030
Now that the disaster is serious,

690
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,960
they've become even more rampant.

691
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,720
The chief told me about it.

692
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,720
But we don't have enough men.

693
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,320
We can't do anything rashly.

694
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,190
Send this letter to Wuxiang Town first

695
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,510
to Prince Jun.

696
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,440
Yes.

697
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,070
In addition,

698
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,630
I have something personal to bother you with.

699
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,530
Can you deliver this letter

700
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,660
to the post office

701
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,590
and have someone bring it to the Garden of Tranquility?

702
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,190
Of course.

703
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,410
Your Highness.

704
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,410
Don't mention it.

705
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,390
It's an honor

706
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,700
to be of service to you.

707
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,590
Your Highness.

708
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,190
The charcoal.

709
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,260
I'll ask the chief for some more.

710
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,780
No need.

711
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,830
It'll be allocated from yours.

712
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,610
There's not much charcoal left.

713
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,050
You and your men have to go outside into the mountains.

714
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,250
You can't get frozen.

715
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,160
Your Highness.

716
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
I have a mattress.

717
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,630
All the supplies have been distributed.

718
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,790
The town has been relieved of the disaster.

719
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,640
Thanks to you, Your Highness.

720
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,140
It's nothing, Magistrate Chu.

721
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,970
Wuxiang got the worst hit.

722
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,880
I was ordered by the Lord.

723
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,660
Of course, I must do my best.

724
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,100
A prince like you

725
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,010
is a blessing for the people.

726
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,030
Magistrate Chu.

727
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,730
Be careful with your words.

728
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,990
This is a toast to you.

729
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,040
Greetings to Prince Jun.

730
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,810
Prince Zheng has asked me to send a message.

731
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,880
The disaster in Canghe is an emergency.

732
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,750
Please help us.

733
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,290
The disaster in Canghe is so serious?

734
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,520
Why have they been hit by bandits?

735
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,030
Your Highness.

736
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,630
Canghe is indeed in trouble.

737
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,090
But we have no time to deal with it.

738
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,020
We can only protect Wuxiang first.

739
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,830
We must protect Wuxiang.

740
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,870
But we can't ignore Canghe either.

741
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,750
If something goes wrong,

742
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,830
it's a total loss.

743
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,740
I know I'm wrong.

744
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,330
I will fix it.

745
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,690
All right.

746
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,130
Get up.

747
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,190
Thank you, Your Highness.

748
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,580
Take stock of the inventory.

749
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,040
Allocate 10,000 koku of rice to Canghe.

750
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,620
Yes.

751
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,590
Your Highness.

752
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,370
One hundred pounds of rice

753
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,400
can only support 300 to 500 people for one day.

754
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,260
10,000 koku of rice is not enough.

755
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,090
Prince Zheng has visited and surveyed.

756
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:34,950
There are 11,425 people

757
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,590
in Canghe Town.

758
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,530
So I beg you

759
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,830
to allocate 50,000 kokus of rice

760
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,160
to ease the urgent need.

761
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,320
Zheng is indeed meticulous.

762
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,900
He's even gone on a field trip.

763
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,490
If that's the case,

764
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,440
50,000 koku it is.

765
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

766
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,210
That's wise.

767
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,620
Don't worry, Your Highness.

768
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,770
The 50,000 kokus of rice

769
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,940
will be so recorded on the gazette.

770
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,389
The disaster in Canghe

771
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,090
is really worrying.

772
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,120
We must not let anything go wrong.

773
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:25,900
Magistrate Chu.

774
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,650
According to your opinion,

775
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,770
should Wuxiang send troops to fight the bandits?

776
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,800
I've heard about these bandits.

777
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,909
But they're

778
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,080
in the Canghe area.

779
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,170
It should be Prince Zheng's job.

780
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,080
He should deal with it.

781
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,120
Besides, the disaster in Wuxiang is serious.

782
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,929
Prince Jun and I

783
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,130
can't send out men.

784
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,900
That's right.

785
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,530
I hope Zheng can deal with the bandits.

786
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,420
Otherwise, the Lord…

787
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,950
Your Highness.

788
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,990
Before the guard of Prince Zheng

789
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,960
came in,

790
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,010
he had gone to the horse post,

791
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,610
saying he had an urgent letter to the capital's Garden of Tranquility.

792
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:21,460
Also,

793
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,960
I've heard

794
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,850
that Prince Zheng seems to be ill.

795
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,360
Your Highness.

796
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,240
I failed to do my job well.

797
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,090
We encountered bandits

798
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,510
and lost the rations.

799
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,240
Please punish me.

800
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,090
Get up.

801
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,300
Get up!

802
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,920
You fought hard to hold on to most of the rations.

803
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,750
Who is to blame?

804
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,690
But

805
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,780
the bandits

806
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,790
did take a lot of rations.

807
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,570
It's to save lives.

808
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
This can support three to five days.

809
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,350
Take care of your wounds.

810
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,020
We'll go into the mountains

811
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,180
and get our food back.

812
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,380
Yes.

813
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,660
It's good you're alive.

814
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,720
Rest well.

815
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,270
Yes.

816
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,330
Guys.

817
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,760
Go back.

818
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,570
Get some rest.

819
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,000
Folks.

820
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,600
Give us a hand.

821
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,130
Unload the grain

822
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,950
and put it in the porridge shed.

823
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,340
Okay.

824
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,710
Kuang Tianlong

825
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,370
has gone rampant.

826
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,460
He was from this village too.

827
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,150
But he didn't do farming

828
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,430
and became a bandit later.

829
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,520
But now it's outrageous.

830
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,050
So…

831
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,690
He even robbed the lifesaving food.

832
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,740
What lawlessness!

833
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,150
Gentleman.

834
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,090
Your cough is getting worse.

835
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,890
I'm afraid you've caught a cold.

836
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,220
Well.

837
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:41,980
Let me

838
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,830
get a doctor for you.

839
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,460
No need.

840
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,960
There are only two doctors in this town.

841
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,620
Like they're not busy enough.

842
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,860
I've brought medicine.

843
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,060
I'll take some later.

844
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,010
Okay.

845
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,820
Let's go back to the room.

846
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,160
His Highness has followed the instructions in your letter.

847
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,520
All letters sent to the Garden of Tranquility

848
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,850
will be sent to us first.

849
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,170
He also said

850
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,290
that Canghe where Prince Zheng went

851
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,290
was not peaceful.

852
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,270
Bandits are rampaging and robbing the relief food.

853
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,480
Go and reply.

854
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,470
Tell him I got it.

855
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,100
Yes.

856
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,060
Your Ladyship,

857
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,480
if we're caught withholding letters...

858
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,740
[Maid, Cuizhu]

859
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,370
It's just a letter from home.

860
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,910
It's not an official document.

861
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,170
What's to be afraid of?

862
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,450
Li Wei can't receive the letter.

863
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,370
Yin Zheng is in the far-away mountains,

864
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,290
ill-informed.

865
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,190
She'll get more worried.

866
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,260
All I need to do

867
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,780
is to

868
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,490
add fuel to the fire.

869
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,920
And they will mess up.

870
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,180
The peppers have died of frost.

871
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,180
Why hasn't Yin Zheng's letter come yet?

872
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,060
Maybe His Highness is busy.

873
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,460
How busy can he be?

874
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,910
He doesn't even have time to write.

875
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,080
Wei.

876
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:26,530
Wei.

877
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,400
Xiyuan.

878
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,990
Bad news.

879
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:32,790
What's wrong?

880
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,280
Zheng was attacked by bandits in Canghe Town.

881
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,730
I'm afraid he's in a bad way.

882
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,210
What?

883
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,270
Here, have some tea.

884
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,040
Don't worry.

885
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,440
An will be back soon.

886
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,010
Don't get too worried.

887
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,050
I got it.

888
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,040
I got it.

889
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,590
What's the situation, Prince An?

890
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,570
Jun did write an official letter,

891
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,480
reporting bandits in Canghe Town

892
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,830
and Zheng's robbery by bandits

893
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,400
We don't know the exact situation yet.

894
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,290
The bandits might only go for supplies.

895
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,030
Don't worry.

896
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:11,980
Wei.

897
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,260
Don't get confused.

898
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,020
An Xiyuan must be calculating.

899
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,790
She's obviously urging you on.

900
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,630
Don't make a wrong choice.

901
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,570
That's right.

902
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,590
Jun and his wife didn't miss a thing

903
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,050
about what happened to Qi…

904
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,900
Forget I said it.

905
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,150
Don't be impulsive.

906
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,450
I understand.

907
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,290
You don't have to worry about me.

908
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,310
Butler Su.

909
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,020
How long before we reach Canghe Town?

910
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,040
Your Ladyship.

911
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,040
Canghe Town is a bit remote.

912
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,900
It's not exactly marked on the map.

913
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,550
But we know it's in the northwest of Wuxiang County.

914
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,990
So as long as we follow the official road,

915
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,670
there shouldn't be any danger.

916
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,470
That's right.

917
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,500
Let's find a post station

918
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,220
ahead

919
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,570
where we can write a letter to inform the official post in Wuxiang County.

920
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:08,900
Okay.

921
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,010
When the letter arrives,

922
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,070
we'll be there too.

923
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,090
They won't send us back.

924
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,680
There should be officers in Wuxiang County

925
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,830
who'll escort us to Canghe Town.

926
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,960
It will be much more convenient.

927
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,690
That's true.

928
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,840
Your Ladyship is very thoughtful.

929
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,020
I should thank you.

930
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,090
If I had told others,

931
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,300
I'm sure they wouldn't let me go.

932
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,140
But Yin Zheng hasn't written back yet.

933
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,630
I'm really worried.

934
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,270
So I have to come and find him.

935
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,950
Your Ladyship, don't say that.

936
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,450
It's for the Prince's sake, isn't it?

937
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,610
I'm obliged to do so.

938
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:41,740
Don't worry.

939
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,010
I will protect you, Yuping and Yuzhan.

940
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,980
You can have a rest.

941
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,970
I'll speed up.

942
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,240
Your Ladyship.

943
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,400
Should we continue the journey?

944
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,580
Forget it

945
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,530
It's been a long day.

946
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,790
The horse is tired too.

947
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,600
Let's stay here for the night.

948
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,040
But Prince Zheng…

949
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,240
Your Ladyship.

950
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,730
I'm sorry.

951
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,680
It's all my fault.

952
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,810
If I hadn't gone the wrong way,

953
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,270
we'd...

954
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,130
Forget it.

955
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,960
You've said that 800 times.

956
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,430
I said I don't blame you.

957
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:21,990
Your Ladyship.

958
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,140
I'll do it.

959
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,210
I'll do it.

960
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,430
Be careful.

961
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,380
I'll do it.

962
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,170
You're all used to living in the city.

963
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,230
How do you know how to live on your own?

964
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,410
Don't cry.

965
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,290
I said it's not your fault.

966
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,710
It's the smoke.

967
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:14,930
Fan it.

968
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,500
The smoke follows me wherever I sit.

969
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,450
It's me.

970
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:40,260
Here.

971
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,690
A bun.

972
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:44,990
Come on.

973
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,360
Big pancake.

974
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:50,960
Here you are.

975
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,420
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

976
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,040
Come on.

977
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,690
And seasoning.

978
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,350
Seasoning?

979
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:55,410
Let me see.

980
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:56,770
Seasoning.

981
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,050
It's chili powder.

982
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:58,640
Who wants it?

983
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,170
I want it.

984
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,040
Here, Butler Su.

985
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,770
Give me some.

986
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,070
Your Ladyship, I've always wondered what's in your pocket.

987
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:04,930
Now I know.

988
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,460
They're all my life-saving treasures.

989
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:24,620
Wang.

990
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,780
Stop.

991
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,870
Your Ladyship, wake up.

992
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,270
Please take a look.

993
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,920
I think our trip is going to be delayed.

994
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,650
Your Ladyship.

995
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:41,980
Well.

996
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,240
I took a wrong turn.

997
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,870
They said

998
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,380
we should go east.

999
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,210
After 10 miles,

1000
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,650
turn southwest, and we can get on the official road.

1001
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,580
But look at this.

1002
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,850
Neither of these

1003
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,860
looks like an official road.

1004
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,820
Yeah.

1005
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,250
Let's listen to the locals.

1006
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:00,400
Wang.

1007
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,000
Go.

1008
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:02,620
Go there.

1009
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,330
You see?

1010
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,870
Tengma Mountain.

1011
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,160
Dafeng Ridge.

1012
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:16,710
Cangyan Hill.

1013
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,170
And Wushi Peak.

1014
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,890
These are the places

1015
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,550
where Kuang Tianlong and his gang

1016
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,500
haunt.

1017
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,540
Squire Lin.

1018
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,500
Clear paths in these places with our men.

1019
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:30,440
Yes.

1020
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,740
Reporting!

1021
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,460
Your Highness.

1022
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,490
Prince Jun asked me to send a message.

1023
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,840
Your wife is coming to Canghe Town

1024
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,310
and has sent word to the post in Wuxiang County.

1025
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,710
But the post hasn't seen her.

1026
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,310
I'm afraid something has gone wrong on the way.

1027
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,570
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

1028
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,800
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

1029
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,300
♫A gust of wind blows♫

1030
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,770
♫And stops by my ear♫

1031
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,060
♫The moon shines♫

1033
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,930
♫Your smiles are all over♫

1034
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,570
♫Gradually I am used to♫

1035
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,490
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

1036
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:48,200
♫I don't dare to get related♫

1037
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,310
♫But you came to me♫

1038
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,970
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫

1039
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,670
♫I don't know what to say. I am so excited♫

1040
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:04,470
♫But you can tell what is in my heart with your eyes♫

1041
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:09,160
♫The road is long. Luckily, I have you♫

1042
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,480
♫In rivers and mountains, let's appreciate the smoke rising♫

1043
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,550
♫The past is gone with the sunrise♫

1044
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:23,230
♫The warmth in your palm is in my heart♫

1045
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:27,920
♫Let's share the light in wind, snow, and coldness♫

1046
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:35,210
♫I am relieved when you are with me♫

1047
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,850
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

1048
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,190
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

♫Your smiles are all over♫

♫Gradually I am used to♫

1055
