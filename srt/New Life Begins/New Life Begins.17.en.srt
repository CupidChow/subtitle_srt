[Episode 17]

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,170
Now it doesn't taste that bitter anymore.

5
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,000
The Imperial Hospital

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,300
not only sends me these medicines every day,

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,550
but also watches me drink them.

8
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,810
I don't know how much longer I have to take them.

9
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,280
Just try to

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,470
bear with it.

11
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,740
I'm familiar with the prescription you are using these days.

12
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,160
Yin Zheng also used it before.

13
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
It's good for the spleen and stomach.

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,500
It won't cause any problem.

15
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,270
No wonder.

16
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,690
I feel like

17
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,080
my appetite has been even better these days.

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
I'm hungry again.

19
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,440
You are here, Lady Yue.

20
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,110
I heard that you've been quite weak

21
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,790
and not in good shape, Princess Kening.

22
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,280
I've always been sick myself.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,390
I know it's not easy to fight against the illnesses.

24
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,940
So,

25
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,870
I invited a few doctors I know

26
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,230
to see if they can be of any help.

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Come on in.

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,540
Thank you for your kindness, My Lady.

29
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,160
But the imperial physicians in the palace have checked on her.

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
And she's been taking medicine according to the prescription.

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,840
Yes.

32
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,329
The imperial physicians in the palace are skilled.

33
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,390
The prescription is pretty good too.

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,810
These doctors

35
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,340
have always taken care of me.

36
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,540
They are all skilled.

37
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,340
Although the imperial physicians are capable,

38
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,820
they may have some other methods

39
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,020
since they are from outside the palace.

40
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,460
We can't take it.

41
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,610
You found them

42
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,810
through your connections, My Lady.

43
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,829
It's inappropriate for us to take advantage of that.

44
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,280
The illness has to be treated somehow.

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,030
I've invited them here

46
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,440
and my favor is already done.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,560
Just let them take a look.

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,120
Besides, we're a family. Don't stand on ceremony.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,800
It's okay.

50
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,079
Come on.

51
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,740
Take a seat.

52
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,040
Your Highness.

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,780
Please.

54
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,030
Why is it so hot?

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,870
My Lady.

56
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,070
I heard that

57
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,250
they've sent someone

58
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,800
to take Princess Ping'an's measurements.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,470
What?

60
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,920
I'm leaving now.

61
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,660
Please take your time to treat her, doctor.

62
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,659
So careless.

63
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,380
Why did you drop your wallet?

64
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,450
Doctor,

65
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,970
may I have a word with you?

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,760
Yes.

67
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,950
Let me help you.

68
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,760
Here's the thing.

69
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,920
Prince Zheng and Her Ladyship

70
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,380
want to talk in private.

71
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,760
Please have some tea in the side hall.

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,480
-OK. -Come on.

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
This way, please.

74
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
It's so hot.

75
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,450
Hurry up.

76
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,720
Take these warmers away.

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,450
It's so hot.

78
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,480
I was so scared.

79
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,790
I almost got caught.

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,580
Li Wei,

81
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,180
you are really good at pretending to be sick.

82
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,930
Did they really send someone

83
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,330
to take Princess Ping'an's measurements?

84
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,840
So Princess Ping'an has been selected.

85
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,440
That's why

86
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,910
Lady Yue suddenly got suspicious.

87
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,880
Does this mean

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,230
Princess Ping'an is in trouble?

89
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,960
As long as the peace-making marriage tradition with Mochuan

90
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,360
in the Year of Geng-Zi doesn't get changed,

91
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,590
there will always be women sacrificed.

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,460
Your Highness.

93
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,810
The doctors know what to say?

94
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,390
They are all wily old birds.

95
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,520
They got it as soon as I gave a hint.

96
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,120
Yin Zheng.

97
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,580
Yin Zheng.

98
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,770
My Lady.

99
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,400
Did you mean you want to do something

100
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,060
judged by your words just now?

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,160
You know what I meant?

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,130
If my guess is right,

103
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,400
you want to cancel

104
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,650
the rule of Xinchuan girls marrying into Mochuan?

105
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,500
Lord Xinchuan almost sacrificed his own daughter.

106
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,159
It seems very difficult

107
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,420
to get his permission.

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,710
If you were me,

109
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,730
wouldn't you give it a try?

110
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,750
I blamed you before.

111
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,310
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,490
You weren't wrong, actually.

113
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,490
No matter how bad my situation is,

114
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,620
I'm still Xinchuan's prince, so my visions are narrow.

115
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,320
I never thought about

116
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,540
how the inferior struggles to survive.

117
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,330
You're not living happily either.

118
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,450
Why do you still

119
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,570
think about others all the time?

120
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,350
It's easy to understand.

121
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,970
My Lady.

122
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,870
Prince Zheng has been treated very harshly since he was young.

123
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,930
Some even told him

124
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,410
that he was treated like this

125
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,810
because of his own fault.

126
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,670
In spite of the harsh treatment he got as he grew up,

127
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,670
he doesn't have hatred in his heart,

128
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,180
but love.

129
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,280
He even swore to himself that

130
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,610
when he gets power,

131
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,159
he will never treat the weak

132
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,540
the way others treated him.

133
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,500
What an excellent man.

134
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,640
My Lady, you got yourself a treasure.

135
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,680
Your Highness. I'm weak now.

136
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,480
Please don't.

137
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,300
The candidate to marry into Mochuan has been decided.

138
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,360
Please listen to the imperial edict.

139
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,690
Prince Kun is here.

140
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,630
I left Mochuan,

141
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,940
where I station, without permission.

142
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,070
I can't be absolved from the guilt no matter what.

143
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,700
Please punish me, My Lord.

144
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,470
Got it.

145
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,660
We'll talk about it later.

146
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,730
Announce the edict.

147
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,130
Yes.

148
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,790
If it's the edict of the marriage arrangement,

149
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,390
My Lord, please...

150
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,530
Prince Kun.

151
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,880
-Please recall the edict, My Lord. -Yin Kun.

152
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,820
As a father,

153
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,350
I don't want Ping'an to marry into Mochuan.

154
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,330
It'll be like killing me.

155
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,830
I'd rather lead troops to attack Mochuan

156
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,540
than let this happen.

157
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,390
The one who sends troops to Mochuan

158
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,030
and destroys the alliance

159
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,760
will be the sinner of Xinchuan.

160
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,040
He should be torn into pieces.

161
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,170
Do you think you can say anything

162
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,930
because you are my eldest son?

163
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,070
I dare not.

164
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,640
I'm just a father.

165
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,550
I want to protect my daughter.

166
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
Please don't be mad, My Lord.

167
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,350
Peace-making marriage with Mochuan is only an unwritten rule.

168
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,810
Mochuan used to be strong.

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,130
Xinchuan was intimidated,

170
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,930
so we had to maintain the relationship in this way.

171
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,880
But now Xinchuan is the head of the nine regions.

172
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,210
It's time to abolish

173
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,670
this unwritten rule.

174
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,670
I may have a way

175
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,870
to cancel the marriage agreement

176
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,030
without affecting the peace between the two regions.

177
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,320
Please allow me to have a try.

178
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,460
OK.

179
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,280
Then I'll

180
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,180
give you three days.

181
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,210
If you can't turn things around in three days,

182
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,620
I can only order

183
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,670
to marry Princess Ping'an into Mochuan.

184
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,570
And you two

185
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,220
will be punished for multiple sins altogether.

186
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,280
Thank you, My Lord.

187
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,950
Prince Kun.

188
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,610
You station in Mochuan,

189
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,880
but you left your post without permission.

190
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,680
You deserve severe punishment.

191
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,810
But considering you've made great contributions,

192
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,590
and you're eager to protect your daughter,

193
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,850
it's understandable.

194
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,220
I order you to

195
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,380
return to Mochuan immediately.

196
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,970
Without my summoning order,

197
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,770
you can't return for five years.

198
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,670
Any objections?

199
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,140
I...

200
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,500
Thank you for your punishment, My Lord.

201
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,820
Only three days.

202
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,990
The time Lord permitted

203
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,940
is too tight.

204
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,110
Mochuan people are boorish

205
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,040
and illiterate.

206
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,830
Compared to the written peace alliance of the nine regions,

207
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,320
they are more willing to believe in

208
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,190
the relationship brought by peace-making marriages.

209
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,900
So that when Mochuan is in trouble,

210
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,300
Xinchuan will help them.

211
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,480
So,

212
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,840
if we can think of other ways

213
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,890
to reassure them,

214
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,810
Lord Mochuan won't ask

215
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,370
the princesses of Xinchuan to marry far away?

216
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,590
Mochuan people live by grazing, not farming.

217
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,310
As time went by, they became lack of supplies

218
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,870
and grew weaker than Xinchuan.

219
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,670
If we can help them solve the fundamental problem,

220
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,180
we might not have to stick to peace-making marriage.

221
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,380
But for so many years,

222
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,520
it's not that Mochuan didn't know they should develop farming and sericulture.

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,920
It's just that they are too old-fashioned.

224
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,390
It's not easy to change the old concept.

225
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,940
Besides, we only have three days.

226
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,820
What should we do?

227
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:54,980
Your Highness.

228
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,550
Your Ladyship.

229
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,040
My Lady.

230
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,120
I made lotus plumule tea

231
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,470
as ordered by Concubine Wei.

232
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,530
It can clear the internal heat and calm your mind.

233
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,280
Thank you.

234
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,150
It's my duty.

235
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,590
The envoy this time is Madam Mochuan.

236
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,820
We will welcome her in the palace tomorrow.

237
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,460
Maybe we can take the chance

238
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,520
and buy us some time tomorrow?

239
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,170
You mean

240
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,520
we should persuade Madam Mochuan?

241
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,100
It might be hard to persuade Lord Mochuan,

242
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,620
but the envoy is Madam Mochuan.

243
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,830
We stand a chance.

244
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,890
[Fine Words and Lofty Deeds]

245
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,310
Madam Mochuan, Emissary. You just arrived in Xinchuan.

246
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,040
Are you used to the living and eating habits here?

247
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,590
Xinchuan is the head of the nine regions now.

248
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,570
Everything is the best here.

249
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,620
[Emissary of Mochuan]

250
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,890
It's just that no matter how good Xinchuan is,

251
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,290
it's not as good as our home.

252
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,530
Madam Mochuan is

253
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,220
appointed by Lord Mochuan

254
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,250
to come and discuss the marriage.

255
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,100
No matter which princess is selected this year,

256
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,110
Madam Mochuan will personally welcome her back.

257
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,410
Emissary just said

258
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,930
no matter how good Xinchuan is, it's not as good as your home.

259
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,670
It's also true

260
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,930
for the princess of Xinchuan.

261
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,010
If she marries far away,

262
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,590
she will have to abandon her family and friends

263
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,120
and go to Mochuan alone.

264
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,750
Even though Madam Mochuan has come to welcome her,

265
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,280
the sadness is inevitable.

266
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,260
What do you mean?

267
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,990
Doesn't Xinchuan want peace-making marriages with Mochuan anymore?

268
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,840
No rush, Emissary.

269
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,170
Let's have some tea

270
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,590
and discuss it.

271
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,350
Serve the tea.

272
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,800
What kind of tea is this?

273
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,530
I've never seen it before.

274
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,530
My Lord.

275
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,920
This is lotus plumule tea.

276
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,560
It's made with lotus plumule and raw licorice.

277
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,740
The lotus plumule is slightly bitter and it's cold in nature.

278
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,940
It can clear the heat and soothe the nerves.

279
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,810
We're here to talk about the marriage arrangement.

280
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,220
You've been avoiding the topic and talking about other things.

281
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,150
You even served us such bitter tea.

282
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,910
What is this about?

283
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,030
You are right about it being bitter, My Lady.

284
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,960
The lotus plumule is the plumule in the center of the lotus seed.

285
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,060
It's taken out of the lotus seed

286
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,270
to be used to make tea.

287
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
Lotus plumule and lotus seed

288
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,220
are like the princess and her family that she marries far away from.

289
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,750
Parent-child separation.

290
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
How could it be sweet?

291
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,780
You've been trying to

292
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,040
tell us about this all this time?

293
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,040
Of course,

294
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,600
everyone knows about this

295
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,900
as a parent or a kid.

296
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,100
No more words needed.

297
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,030
What we really want to say is

298
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,680
lotus plumule tea is not the only type of tea

299
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,010
that can soothe the nerves.

300
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,080
There are chrysanthemum tea,

301
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,260
lonicera japonica tea

302
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,700
and Semen Cassiae tea, etc.

303
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,360
They all have the same effect.

304
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,980
Please report it to Lord Mochuan, My Lady.

305
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,040
If Mochuan agrees,

306
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,020
Xinchuan is willing to send some talents

307
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,190
to assist Mochuan in farming and agriculture.

308
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,200
They'll help you adapt measures to local conditions

309
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
and solve the shortage of supplies.

310
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,030
Xinchuan doesn't want to cancel the marriage agreement by force.

311
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,820
It may hurt the harmony between Xinchuan and Mochuan.

312
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,440
The nine regions are closely connected.

313
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,180
We are willing to help Mochuan

314
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,290
in exchange for sparing the princess from the pain of separation.

315
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,040
My Lady.

316
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,950
What do you think?

317
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,849
Xinchuan has been stalling the marriage letter for long.

318
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,170
We knew that

319
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,710
Lord Xinchuan must already have other plans.

320
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,390
But peace-making marriage

321
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,810
is the tradition between the two regions.

322
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,100
Forgive me for not being able to

323
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,230
reply on behalf of Lord Mochuan.

324
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,220
Besides,

325
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,460
what you said

326
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,550
is just a verbal agreement.

327
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,880
It's not confirmed yet.

328
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,990
I understand your concerns,

329
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,610
My Lady.

330
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,540
To show our sincerity,

331
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,150
Xinchuan will send emissaries

332
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,120
to Mochuan for field inspection today.

333
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,430
If Mochuan is satisfied with the proposal we make,

334
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,830
we can cancel the marriage agreement then.

335
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,380
As you said,

336
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,680
instead of lotus plumule tea,

337
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,630
drinking other kinds of tea can do the same thing.

338
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,010
I'm willing to give it a try.

339
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,340
Put off the marriage arrangement.

340
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,610
We'll discuss it after your emissaries' departure to Mochuan.

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,310
Good.

342
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,090
My Lord.

343
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,600
My concubine was born in a farmer's family.

344
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
She knows quite a lot about farming.

345
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,930
Please allow me

346
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,080
to bring her to Mochuan for field inspection.

347
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,460
Okay.

348
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,030
I'll leave it to you.

349
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,770
Get ready to depart.

350
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,100
-Yes. -Yes.

351
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,470
We had a great conversation today

352
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,280
and reached a consensus.

353
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,800
Here.

354
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,570
A toast to Emissary and Madam Mochuan.

355
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,550
Well done.

356
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,920
You got nine points this time.

357
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,950
Thank you, Ms. Yuan Ying.

358
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,100
Let me.

359
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,280
Your Highness.

360
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,030
What medicine are you taking?

361
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,230
You went to see a doctor outside the palace a few days ago.

362
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,500
And you've been drinking this since you came back.

363
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,830
Your condition seems to be even worse.

364
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,830
Replenishing vital essence.

365
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,400
It's not your business.

366
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't pry.

367
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,720
Your Highness.

368
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,330
Your nose is bleeding again.

369
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,620
Your nose bleeds every time you drink this.

370
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,080
How about I call an imperial physician here?

371
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,400
It's a matter of my offspring.

372
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,360
Don't tell anyone,

373
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,280
or I'll break your legs.

374
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,080
Do you hear me?

375
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,420
An.

376
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,220
An.

377
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:55,880
Zheng.

378
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,330
Are you not feeling well?

379
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,840
It's too hot.

380
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,570
Suffering from internal heat.

381
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,680
Something's up?

382
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,820
I'm going to Mochuan as the emissary tomorrow.

383
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,880
Didn't we work well together in Jinchuan?

384
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,570
I thought you're knowledgeable and flexible.

385
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,000
With you there, it will be much easier.

386
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,460
Why don't you come with me?

387
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,190
Zheng.

388
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,060
To be honest,

389
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,530
look at me now.

390
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,290
I want to go too.

391
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,850
But I can't do it.

392
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,400
Where are you going again?

393
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,930
Mochuan?

394
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,040
Mochuan.

395
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,550
The Mochuan where men are strong

396
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,230
and extraordinarily brave,

397
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,830
nothing like us in Xinchuan?

398
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,840
That's true.

399
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,910
Really rough.

400
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,580
Indeed.

401
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,790
Let me pack up then.

402
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,720
Let's go learn from them together.

403
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,500
Wait for me.

404
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,910
Pack the clothes. Hurry up.

405
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,810
It's tomorrow.

406
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,080
No hurry.

407
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm in a hurry.

408
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,560
It's a good thing to learn from others.

409
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,490
You are leaving?

410
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm the peace-making emissary

411
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,800
who bears the friendship between Xinchuan and Mochuan this time.

412
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,000
The mission is tough.

413
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,510
But Xinchuan needs me.

414
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,260
The nine regions are waiting for me.

415
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,180
The new solar terms in Mochuan are calling me.

416
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,060
Don't worry.

417
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,410
Just take care of yourselves.

418
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,760
Yes.

419
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,990
It's almost time.

420
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:22,950
I should go.

421
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,390
Where's Winter Solstice?

422
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,520
She's not ready yet?

423
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,520
Your Highness.

424
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,750
Winter Solstice is sick.

425
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,120
Sick?

426
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,610
She was fine yesterday.

427
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,290
Yes.

428
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,630
We were also confused.

429
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,630
She suddenly had a fever last night.

430
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,690
And she couldn't get out of bed today.

431
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,420
She seems to have caught a cold.

432
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,780
I need to check on her.

433
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,290
No need.

434
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,770
The medicine is already prescribed.

435
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,160
It's said that she needs to rest for a few days

436
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,360
and can't travel far.

437
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,460
I wanted to take Winter Solstice

438
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,190
to visit her hometown Mochuan.

439
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,270
Winter Solstice said

440
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,180
if you miss her,

441
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,740
don't visit her in person.

442
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,500
She's afraid she'll infect you.

443
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,900
My cute Winter Solstice.

444
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,760
So thoughtful.

445
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,840
Fine.

446
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,830
You guys

447
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,610
take good care of Winter Solstice

448
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,680
and yourselves.

449
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,650
I'm leaving.

450
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,730
Don't miss me too much.

451
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,720
Wait for me.

452
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,510
Yuan Ying.

453
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,250
Come with us.

454
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,750
You've never been to Mochuan, have you?

455
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,390
There are many chores to do in the mansion.

456
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,190
Someone needs to take care of it.

457
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,060
Just go.

458
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,840
Yuan Ying.

459
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,830
Not again.

460
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,540
Yuan Ying.

461
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,630
After taking care of Mochuan's business,

462
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,560
I think it's time for Lord Xinchuan

463
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,080
to set a formal position for Prince Zheng.

464
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,960
So now is the critical time.

465
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,090
Both you in Mochuan

466
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,590
and I in the mansion

467
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,470
can't make any mistakes.

468
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,400
Understand?

469
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,690
Yes.

470
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,280
I promise I won't hold you back.

471
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,470
I promise.

472
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,850
I'll bring you some specialties back.

473
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,510
I'm leaving.

474
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,660
I'm really leaving.

475
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,940
I'm back.

476
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,230
I miss you so much.

477
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,630
I'm really leaving.

478
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:34,970
Go.

479
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,200
Take care of yourself.

[Garden of Tranquility]

481
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,050
Go back.

482
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,580
What is this?

483
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,090
This is called termite mushroom.

484
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,860
Mochuan people love drinking.

485
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,840
After we arrive in Mochuan,

486
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,200
we'll definitely have to drink several times.

487
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,000
The mushroom soup made of termite mushroom is the best for hangover.

488
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,450
Warning beforehand.

489
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,580
Don't drink too much when we are there.

490
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,050
Why?

491
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,180
Are you afraid that I'll do something or...?

492
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,550
I'm afraid you'll throw up with Qi.

493
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,720
Speaking of which,

494
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,490
my grandpa is from Mochuan.

495
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,330
When Grandpa was young,

496
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,180
he went to Jichuan by chance.

497
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,410
He only went back to his hometown in Mochuan when I was six.

498
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,050
But

499
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,600
I've never been back to Mochuan.

500
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,600
When we arrive,

501
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,260
I'll take you to see him.

502
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,600
I heard that there are many wild beasts in Mochuan.

503
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I wonder if I've brought enough weapons.

504
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,080
Of course.

505
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,610
How can these not be enough?

506
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,620
In my opinion,

507
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,280
compared to you,

508
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,230
those wild beasts are more in danger.

509
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,430
You can kill a beast with just one punch.

510
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,470
Well.

511
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,480
I didn't mean that.

512
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,880
I'm not saying you're fierce.

513
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,440
I didn't mean that.

514
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
I meant you can protect me.

515
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,620
If something really dangerous happens,

516
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,680
I'll hide behind you.

517
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,170
Right?

518
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,640
Why is An so sleepy lately?

519
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,350
I heard

520
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,250
he's been taking some medicine recently.

521
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,540
He seems to be planning for a big move.

522
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,310
A big move?

523
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,240
What kind of big move causes nose bleeding?

524
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,910
Indeed.

525
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,290
Wipe it for him.

526
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,130
I wipe it?

527
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,470
Don't wipe it.

528
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,820
He'll be woken up by it.

529
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,620
Let him sleep.

530
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,250
Let him sleep.

531
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,620
There must be a big move.

532
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,270
What big move?

533
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,500

00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:25,850
Let's go, Shangguan.

563
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,780
Sister-in-law.

564
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,490
How are you doing?

565
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,520
Much better.

566
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,650
Mochuan seems peaceful.

567
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,110
It doesn't look like a place with wild beasts.

568
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,760
If we don't see them today, we will in the future.

569
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,290
No hurry.

570
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,000
Did you hear anything?

571
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,650
Let go.

572
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,290
No.

573
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,880
You promised to protect me.

574
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,340
What's all this noise?

575
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,920
Mochuan is an extremely cold place.

576
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,830
Have some camel milk to warm your body.

577
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,390
Thank you.

578
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,030
This camel milk is good.

579
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,060
I feel warm right after drinking it.

580
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,610
You must all be hungry.

581
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,710
I asked the servants to prepare some snacks.

582
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,300
Grab a bite first.

583
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,730
How can I fill myself with snacks?

584
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,320
Be quiet.

585
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
These are snacks?

586
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,050
Eat as much as you can.

587
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,750
I've long heard that everything in Mochuan is big.

588
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,350
It deserves its reputation.

589
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,540
Qi, let's split it.

590
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,700
Shangguan.

591
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,560
Zheng.

592
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,280
Here.

593
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,080
Have a big bun.

594
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,800
This is too big.

595
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,400
Is it good?

596
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,340
Yes.

597
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,520
Mochuan is different from Xinchuan.

598
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,400
Instead of reasoning,

599
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,750
Mochuan people prefer solving problems by drinking.

600
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,510
Zheng.

601
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,980
I've planned it well.

602
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,890
I'll bring you to see Qiao later.

603
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,550
Qiao

604
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,220
is the most prestigious shepherd in Mochuan.

605
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,880
All the farmers listen to him in spite of the size of their business.

606
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,370
If you can persuade him

607
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,800
to change their mind,

608
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,640
it'll be easier

609
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,420
to promote farming.

610
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,160
Thank you for your hard work, Kun.

611
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,490
That's what I should do.

612
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,690
An.

613
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
Be careful how much you drink later.

614
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,900
I won't over-drink.

615
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,440
You've never drunk with Mochuan people.

616
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,350
You don't know.

617
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,530
When will he be here?

618
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,400
Soon, I think.

619
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,290
I'm here.

620
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,630
I'm late.

621
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,740
[Clan leader in Mochuan, Qiao]

622
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,110
Your Highness.

623
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,910
I'm late.

624
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,050
I'm really sorry.

625
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,760
I'll drink three cups as punishment.

626
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,080
Here.

627
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,610
Brother.

628
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,070
Good.

629
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,980
Here, brother.

630
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,000
Good.

631
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,160
Good.

632
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,900
It's not three cups, but three bowls.

633
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,550
Good.

634
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,330
I've drunk it up.

635
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,960
You came all the way here.

636
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,650
Please forgive me

637
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,680
if I can't take care of all your needs.

638
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,550
Have a seat.

639
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,150
Let me introduce these three.

640
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,880
This is Xinchuan's Third Prince, Prince An.

641
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,750
Fifth Prince, Prince Qi.

642
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,640
Sixth Prince, Prince Zheng.

643
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,420
They are my real brothers.

644
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,050
They can also be trusted.

645
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,520
They are all my subordinates.

646
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,510
No outsiders.

647
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,730
I invited you here today

648
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,330
to discuss

649
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,870
about promoting farming.

650
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,750
My eldest brother told me that you are a local talent.

651
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,830
As long as you speak,

652
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,150
everyone here will respond.

653
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,220
So we thought...

654
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,500
Let's not get down to business yet.

655
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,140
Since you're in Mochuan,

656
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,850
you must try the Burning Knife Wine of Mochuan.

657
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,200
I've had two rounds

658
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,320
since morning.

659
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,130
Also another round tonight.

660
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,430
So I won't drink too much now.

661
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,830
-OK. -Please forgive me.

662
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,380
Serve the wine.

663
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,180
Come on.

664
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,260
Here.

665
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,480
This is too much.

666
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,960
Alright.

667
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:09,770
Okay.

668
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,730
So much wine.

669
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,580
One jar for each?

670
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,410
You must have never been to Mochuan, my sister.

671
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,750
Here, we only

672
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,940
drink in jars.

673
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,670
Start with three jars each.

674
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,380
Come on.

675
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,860
Come on.

676
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,310
Let's drink.

677
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,370
Drink up, everyone.

678
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,690
Come on.

679
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,120
Drink as much as you want.

680
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,610
Listen.

681
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,360
We are very civilized when drinking here.

682
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,400
We never force people to drink.

683
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,820
Drink.

684
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,760
Prince Zheng, look how well they dance.

685
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,220
Good.

686
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,600
Let's eat and drink.

687
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:27,960
Okay.

688
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,650
Come on.

689
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,230
Drink.

690
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Excited heart and

691
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
trembling hands.

692
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,370
I want to drink with you, Qi.

693
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,480
Come on.

694
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,010
I'll drink up first out of respect.

695
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,730
Let's go.

696
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,170
Miss, you dance...

697
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,410
So manly.

698
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,320
I haven't asked you

699
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,770
your name.

700
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,640
My last name is Linhu.

701
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,760
My first name is Chong.

702
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,220
Come on.

703
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,770
Let's drink.

704
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,720
I don't drink.

705
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,440
Miss.

706
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,610
I feel like I'm meeting you too late.

707
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,040
Come back to Xinchuan with me.

708
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,610
Okay?

709
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,280
I haven't completed

710
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,810
my 24 solar term girls yet.

711
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,710
You will be

712
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,760
Great Cold.

713
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,970
As the saying goes,

714
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,900
as we meet, we become good friends.

715
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,560
We should have a heart-to-heart drink, right?

716
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,020
Come on.

717
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,470
Qiao.

718
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,930
He can't drink much.

719
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,980
My grandfather is from Mochuan.

720
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,880
I'll drink with you.

721
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,520
What are you talking about, my sister?

722
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,230
How can a man not be able to drink?

723
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,120
Come on, let's eat and drink.

724
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,550
No way.

725
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,200
Drink.

726
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,780
Come on.

727
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,240
Drink.

728
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,820
The last bowl.

729
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,040
You can hold your liquor.

730
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,010
I appreciate

731
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,230
your kindness, An.

732
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,570
Why don't you stay

733
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,640
and be my 30th?

734
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,260
My Beloved

735
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,330
are ranked from 1st to 29th.

736
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,400
Since you are here,

737
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,550
you can make it to 30.

738
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,760
Let's drink.

739
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,260
Drink.

740
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,450
Vomit it out and let's continue drinking.

741
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
Come on, let's drink.

742
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,410
Cheers.

743
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,050
Already wasted?

744
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,860
I told you he can't drink.

745
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,660
Forget it.

746
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,530
Let him lie down.

747
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,930
Here, enjoy your drinks.

748
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,370
Do you think

749
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,320
Mochuan people can drink more than Xinchuan people?

750
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,920
They are so good at drinking.

751
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,900
Qi, have you finished drinking?

752
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,969
Let's drink back in my mansion.

753
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:14,870
You're a dog if you don't drink.

754
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,929
I can drink.

755
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,469
Let's go.

756
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,199
Qi.

757
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,949
Kun.

758
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,860
Let's go home and drink.

759
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,260
Kun.

760
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,929
No one is following us.

761
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,230
Your Highness.

762
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,210
You're smart.

763
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,929
You know to pretend to be drunk.

764
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:32,440
Otherwise, we'll be wasted.

765
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,679
Look.

766
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,030
Don't hold me. I can walk.

767
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,170
It's so hot.

768
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,750
Zheng.

769
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,260
Get in my sedan.

770
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,159
Second round.

771
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,550
Get in my sedan.

772
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,870
Gosh.

773
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,570
We didn't talk any business during all this.

774
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,650
We can't do this anymore.

775
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,970
We have to think of a way.

776
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,550
Yeah.

777
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,000
Time to sleep.

778
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,680
You can't sleep?

779
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,340
Go to sleep.

780
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,940
You can't sleep?

781
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,780
Hei,

782
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,810
you're the most lethal.

783
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,180
You're the boss.

784
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,810
You sleep in the middle, okay?

785
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,450
Okay.

786
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,830
Good boy, Hei.

787
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,420
Come on.

788
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,150
Let me kiss you, my son.

789
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,330
Okay.

790
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,150
Lie here.

791
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,320
Don't move.

792
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,800
Lie down.

793
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,290
Don't run around.

794
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,170
Sleep well.

795
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,810
Baby.

796
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,320
What are you doing?

797
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,240
Nanny Liu, you scared me.

798
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,300
Who is Nanny Liu?

799
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
You are Nanny Liu.

800
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,560
Nanny Liu.

801
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,410
This room is too small.

802
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,000
Too small.

803
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,520
There's no place for the weapons.

804
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,160
But it's okay.

805
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,960
I gave up my sleeping space to them.

806
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,310
Where should I sleep?

807
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,180
I dare not let Jing know.

808
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,870
Jing

809
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,770
has the softest heart.

810
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,830
If she knows I'm like this,

811
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,180
she would feel sorry for me.

812
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,160
Right, baby?

813
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,760
Go to sleep.

814
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,810
Don't be afraid.

815
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,450
Where will you sleep?

816
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,210
Where will I sleep...

817
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,930
I'll sleep...

818
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,460
I'll sleep...

819
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,790
I'll sleep on the floor.

820
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,900
These are Jing's treasures.

821
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,550
They are more important than me.

822
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,650
I need to take good care of them.

823
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,080
You don't understand.

824
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,830
Right, baby?

825
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,680
You're too loud.

826
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,800
Sleep, baby.

827
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,310
Are you cold?

828
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,590
Jing.

829
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,110
Go to sleep.

830
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,660
Coming.

831
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,030
Okay.

832
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,920
The mushroom soup is good for hangover.

833
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,950
Let Prince Qi drink it.

834
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,550
Thank you.

835
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,190
Why are you blushing?

836
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,480
No.

837
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,560
You were mistaken.

838
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,200
Rest early.

839
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,280
Thanks to you for bringing the termite mushroom.

840
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,590
I've asked Su Shen to deliver a bowl to An.

841
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:05,960
I knew it.

842
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,070
When my father drank too much in social activities,

843
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,050
my mother always made soup for him.

844
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,940
It seems Qiao doesn't want to help us at all.

845
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,820
He was only here for Kun's sake.

846
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,010
He knows that

847
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,490
it's very troublesome to promote the farming system in Mochuan.

848
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,360
They'll have to change the farmers' concept

849
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,160
of only grazing and not farming.

850
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,970
It also takes a lot of time and energy.

851
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,850
It's not a good deal.

852
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,120
So he drank.

853
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,930
He got drunk

854
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,780
and got us drunk.

855
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,710
This way, we couldn't do anything.

856
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,490
Let's get down to business first thing tomorrow.

857
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
We won't drink until we get the deal.

858
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,940
In this case,

859
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,840
it's easy to make things awkward.

860
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,110
What should we do?

861
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,790
If we drink again,

862
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,800
tomorrow will be in vain as well.

863
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,610
There's still some other way.

864
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,490
Did you bring some Pu'er from Jichuan?

865
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,330
I'm here.

866
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,300
I'm here.

867
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,440
Your Highness, I'm late.

868
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,300
I'm late.

869
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,000
We had another round this morning.

870
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,700
So I'm late.

871
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,350
I'll drink three cups as punishment.

872
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,070
What do you think?

873
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,400
Okay.

874
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,600
Top quality Pu'er from Jichuan.

875
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,650
Look at this.

876
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:04,910
Today,

877
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,080
it's not convenient.

878
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,510
I don't feel well either.

879
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,760
Also, not everyone is here.

880
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,440
How about

881
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,170
we meet another day?

882
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,690
Qiao.

883
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,830
It's better to make it today.

884
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,680
Raw Pu'er is good for refreshing and sobering up.

885
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,410
We drink tea according to the rule of three bricks.

886
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,170
Starting with three bricks.

887
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,240
[Tea]

888
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,440
You can't leave if you can't finish it.

889
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,410
I don't like tea.

890
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,060
Qiao.

891
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,480
What's tea?

892
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,830
Tea is blessing, tea is longevity.

893
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,190
Tea brings good luck and longevity.

894
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,830
Qiao, for your health,

895
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,240
you have to drink this tea no matter what.

896
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,640
Why?

897
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,080
Because you...

898
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,430
It's not easy for you to come here, Qiao.

899
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,770
Yeah, it's not easy for you to come here.

900
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,210
Qiao.

901
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,880
How about this?

902
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,540
I'll drink tea instead of wine

903
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,170
as a toast back to you, Qiao,

904
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,230
for your hospitality yesterday.

905
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,210
Hospitality yesterday.

906
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,010
Come on, Qiao.

907
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,810
Okay.

908
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,960
Bottoms up.

909
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,270
Qiao, come on.

910
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,260
No, An.

911
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:05,720
Qiao.

912
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,570
You need to treat us the same way.

913
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,990
You've had a drink with Qi but you won't drink with me?

914
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,320
So you don't respect me?

915
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,850
How can I not?

916
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,580
But I just drank a lot of wine.

917
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,640
I have a stomachache.

918
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,800
We'd rather have a hole in the stomach

919
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,790
than a crack in a relationship.

920
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,400
You're a man.

921
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,860
Cheers.

922
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,850
The sky is blue, and the ocean is blue.

923
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,270
Pass it down one by one.

924
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,240
Qiao.

925
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,690
It's my turn.

926
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,100
Kun.

927
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,450
What's so good about this?

928
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,030
We only drink wine in Mochuan,

929
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,290
not tea.

930
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,860
But tea is good for health.

931
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,200
Drinking tea

932
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,050
requires practice too.

933
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:45,990
Right.

934
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,040
Tea is better than wine.

935
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,600
The more you drink, the better it tastes.

936
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,820
Drinking tea can warm your stomach.

937
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,420
You won't get drunk even after a thousand cups.

938
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,840
Qiao is such a good drinker.

939
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,080
Let me go to the bathroom.

940
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,820
Qiao.

941
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,610
You've only drunk a few sips.

942
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,160
You can't handle the tea, Qiao?

943
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,100
Hey, let me...

944
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,150
Qiao.

945
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,840
You drank with us all afternoon yesterday

946
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,620
and didn't go to the toilet.

947
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,950
Why do you want to go now?

948
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,460
Do you want to run away?

949
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,210
I can't hold it anymore.

950
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,420
Let me out.

951
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,040
Prince Zheng.

952
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,690
Please.

953
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,990
Let me go to the toilet.

954
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,190
I promise I won't run.

955
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,730
Qiao, so you are sober now.

956
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,210
Yes, I am.

957
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,900
Since you're sober, let's get down to business.

958
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,770
Go ahead.

959
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,720
We know Mochuan people are conservative.

960
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,760
It's not easy to develop farming here.

961
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,950
So we understand

962
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,570
if you don't help us, Qiao.

963
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,570
It's just that we need to see Lord Mochuan in a few days.

964
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,430
We need to

965
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,420
report to him about your attitude.

966
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,590
If you don't support us,

967
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,910
I'm afraid it will be bad for you.

968
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,150
Since you've found me,

969
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,270
you should know that

970
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,820
I have a say in Mochuan.

971
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,030
I also have a say in front of

972
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,090
Lord Mochuan.

973
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,700
Of course.

974
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,890
In Mochuan,

975
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,040
everyone knows you are capable, Qiao.

976
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,760
After I return to Xinchuan,

977
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,140
I'll introduce you

978
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,730
to Lord Xinchuan as well.

979
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,180
We will make you famous in the nine regions.

980
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:41,600
Well...

981
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,490
Xinchuan is the head of the nine regions.

982
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,370
Lord Xinchuan is busy.

983
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,200
He doesn't have time to care about a nobody like me.

984
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,140
You're wrong.

985
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,140
Xinchuan wants to help Mochuan develop farming.

986
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,010
It requires your consent, Qiao.

987
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,540
As for your affairs,

988
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,770
Lord Xinchuan has to hear about them.

989
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,660
Yes.

990
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,770
I don't know how much of a say you'll have in front of him, though.

991
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,670
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

992
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,900
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

993
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,400
♫A gust of wind blows♫

994
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,840
♫And stops by my ear♫

995
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,160
♫The moon shines♫

996
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,460

♫Your smiles are all over♫

998
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,670
♫Gradually I am used to♫

999
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,590
♫Experiencing ups and downs myself♫

1000
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,300
♫I don't dare to get related♫

1001
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,410
♫But you came to me♫

1002
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:11,070
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫

1003
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,770
♫I don't know what to say. I am so excited♫

1004
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,570
♫But you can tell what is in my heart with your eyes♫

1005
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:25,260
♫The road is long. Luckily, I have you♫

1006
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,580
♫In rivers and mountains, let's appreciate the smoke rising♫

1007
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,650
♫The past is gone with the sunrise♫

1008
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:39,330
♫The warmth in your palm is in my heart♫

1009
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,020
♫Let's share the light in wind, snow, and coldness♫

1010
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:51,310
♫I am relieved when you are with me♫

1011
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,950
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

1012
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,290
♫Falls between your eyebrows♫

1013

♫And stops by my ear♫

1015
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,360
♫The moon shines♫

1016
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,670
♫In my heart♫
