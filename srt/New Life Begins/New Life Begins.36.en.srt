[Episode 36]

4
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,020
Hurry up.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,090
There.

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,320
Let's take a detour.

7
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,320
Hurry up.

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:45,960
Hurry.

9
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,710
OK.

10
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,860
Stop the coach.

11
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,640
Lady.

12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,200
Bad news.

13
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,050
We must have run into bandits.

14
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,530
I turned around but didn't get rid of them.

15
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,530
What should we do?

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,600
What should we do, Lady?

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,430
Yes, Lady.

18
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,620
What should we do?

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Let's hide first.

20
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,000
Hide.

21
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,400
Hurry up.

22
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,840
Where are we hiding?

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,890
This way.

24
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,440
Hurry up.

25
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,070
No one is here.

26
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,410
Go!

27
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,450
So much money.

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,020
We can take it back to report to our boss.

29
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,660
Yes.

30
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,910
My eyes!

31
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,420
Go after them!

32
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,950
Prince.

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,300
Where is Li Wei?

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,900
In order to protect us,

35
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,520
she left with the bandits.

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Where did they go?

37
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,470
I don't know.

38
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,180
Zheng.

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,850
I heard that Qiu Tianlong's men

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,160
are all outlaws.

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,890
I'm afraid it's dangerous this time.

42
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,280
Send your men to look for her.

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
Brother Jun, please send some men from the county government.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
I understand your worry.

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,510
But...

46
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,230
Lady Wei

47
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,200
must have been caught by the thugs.

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,140
It's not good for our reputation

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,300
to look for her openly.

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,270
Yes, Prince Zheng.

51
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,010
Please send some men.

52
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,910
OK.

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,390
OK.

54
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,040
Prince.

55
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,190
Is anyone there?

56
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,730
Is anyone home?

57
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,540
Is anyone there?

58
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,970
Is anyone home?

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,630
Is anyone home?

60
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,610
Brother.

61
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,810
We ran into bandits on the way.

62
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,830
Could you please help us report to the government?

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,540
Come on.

64
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,230
Come in.

65
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,900
Excuse us.

66
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,490
Prince.

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,690
The bandits in the east have been wiped out.

68
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,720
We didn't find Lady Wei.

69
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,930
We've wiped out the bandits in the west.

70
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,480
We didn't find Her Ladyship either.

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,340
Neither did we.

72
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,180
Prince.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
The bandits around have been wiped out,

74
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,850
but we haven't found Her Ladyship.

75
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,110
What should we do next?

76
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,140
No way.

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,159
Since he has a name,

78
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,320
he must have ancestral estate.

79
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,690
Where is his ancestral estate?

80
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,840
He can't hide in his house.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Take me there.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,350
Yes.

83
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,280
Let's go.

84
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,130
Behave!

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,420
Who are you?

86
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,750
He is Kuang Tianlong.

87
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,110
Where is the woman you caught?

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,340
Who are you?

89
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,390
How dare you ask me questions?

90
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,330
Where is she?

91
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,590
I've killed her.

92
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,980
Brother.

93
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,660
Brother.

94
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,420
I'll ask you one last time.

95
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,180
Where did she go?

96
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,410
I'll tell you.

97
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
I didn't kill her.

98
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,930
That woman tricked us into eating something bad

99
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,060
and ran away when we weren't watching.

100
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,300
Behave!

101
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,320
There are three left.

102
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,370
My first wish.

103
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,110
I think starving to death is the worst way to die.

104
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,910
If possible,

105
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,160
please bless me not to starve to death.

106
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,770
Don't let me starve to death.

107
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,640
Don't let me starve to death.

108
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,550
Don't let me starve to death.

109
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,800
Fire, don't go out.

110
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,720
I don't want to starve to death

111
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,830
or freeze to death.

112
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,330
Don't let me starve to death.

113
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,150
Don't let me freeze to death.

114
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,780
Fire, don't go out.

115
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,030
Fire, don't go out.

116
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,310
The last one.

117
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,890
I can freeze to death

118
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,220
or starve to death.

119
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,960
But I miss Yin Zheng so much.

120
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,240
Can I

121
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,550
see him again?

122
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,310
Please.

123
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,830
I miss him so much.

124
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,590
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,020
I'm late.

126
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,470
Yin Zheng.

127
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,560
Yin Zheng.

128
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,870
Yin Zheng.

129
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,460
I was scared to death.

130
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,320
But when I thought of you,

131
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,830
I wasn't scared anymore.

132
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,770
Those bandits were stupid

133
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,730
to let me get the chance.

134
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,600
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,350
What are you sorry for?

136
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,590
As long as you are safe,

137
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
you don't have to feel sorry.

138
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,480
When Xiyuan told me that you were in danger,

139
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,170
I was so worried.

140
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,800
It's my fault.

141
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,290
I've never been so scared.

142
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,090
It's not your fault.

143
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,490
On the contrary,

144
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,130
I troubled you to save me.

145
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,910
Sorry.

146
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,380
Prince Zheng, Madam.

147
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,330
Why are they calling me Madam?

148
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,070
Put me down.

149
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:27,730
No.

150
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Sorry, everyone.

151
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,130
My wife is shy.

152
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Put me down.

153
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:32,910
No.

154
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,760
What are you waiting for?

155
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,360
Follow up.

156
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,070
Luckily, you're fine.

157
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,600
Otherwise, I would not live either.

158
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,080
Enough.

159
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,980
We don't do this in our family.

160
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,330
I'm back safely.

161
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,380
Your Ladyship,

162
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,490
Prince specially asked me to make this ginger soup

163
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,130
to remove your cold.

164
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,860
Thank you.

165
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,300
Luckily, you're fine.

166
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Otherwise, I would not live either.

167
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,900
I just comforted Ping and Zhan.

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,730
You're acting like this again.

169
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,960
Why are you coughing?

170
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,130
Did you catch a cold?

171
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,170
I'm fine.

172
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,830
Have some ginger soup first.

173
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,810
Here.

174
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,420
Didn't I write to you

175
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,980
that everything is fine here?

176
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,910
Why are you here?

177
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,950
I didn't receive the letter.

178
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,080
Xiyuan told me

179
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,450
you met bandits.

180
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,840
I was really worried,

181
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,700
so I came to you.

182
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,520
You didn't receive the letter?

183
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,060
Xiyuan used on me

184
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,880
the trick she used on Shangguan.

185
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,920
But I feel much relieved

186
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
to be with you now.

187
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:15,970
Zheng.

188
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,860
Is Li Wei all right?

189
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,780
Did the doctor come to see her?

190
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,050
I brought ginseng

191
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,060
for her.

192
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,280
Can I have a word with you?

193
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,370
Remember to take it.

194
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,910
What do you want to tell me?

195
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Do you think you can hide everything

196
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,470
after confiscating letters to the Garden of Tranquility?

197
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,620
I don't understand what you said.

198
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,960
Don't involve the inner courtyard with court affairs.

199
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,120
If you put your dirty hands in the Garden of Tranquility again,

200
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,780
you will die a terrible death.

201
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:33,980
Prince,

202
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,910
this was sent here urgently from Canghe Town.

203
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,210
[We have completed the relief in Canghe Town, but Brother Jun doesn't want to handle the documents.]

204
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,210
[Brother An, please help me check the disaster relief accounts of the Ministry of Revenue.]

205
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,210
[Yours, Zheng]

206
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,770
Zheng needs me now.

207
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,550
I have to help him.

208
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,090
Prince,

209
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,100
didn't you plan to be neutral?

210
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,960
I wanted to stay out of this.

211
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,510
But after all,

212
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,850
I have a better relationship with Zheng.

213
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,860
Jun has written so many official documents.

214
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,240
The articles are all claiming credits.

215
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,680
Those people in Wuxiang Town

216
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,210
are eager to praise him too.

217
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,910
It's obvious that there will be endless troubles.

218
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,420
Now it seems

219
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,030
Zheng has kept his composure.

220
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,800
My intuition tells me

221
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,370
I should support him.

222
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,510
It's not easy for Jun

223
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,440
in Wuxiang Town.

224
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,830
He still overcame so many difficulties.

225
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,860
Everyone praised him.

226
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,840
The magistrate of Wuxiang County also said he did a good job.

227
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,820
Jun blowed his own trumpet.

228
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,920
He's afraid that his merits will be forgotten.

229
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,360
It's nothing.

230
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,370
The disaster is over after all.

231
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,760
As for Zheng,

232
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,369
his official documents

233
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,260
are two short.

234
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,690
The accomplishments in his one wad

235
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,750
are less than those in Jun's one page.

236
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,560
I cleared the bandits' nest and collected all the gains.

237
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,520
In Canghhe Town, there are 1,800,000 kilograms of leftover grains

238
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,040
and 10,000 kilograms of charcoal.

239
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,740
It's enough for the time being.

240
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,070
The surplus will be sent to Xushan and Chongling for relief.

241
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,970
He really cherishes his words.

242
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,390
By the way,

243
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,280
have you checked the accounts of the Ministry of Revenue?

244
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,810
Please have a look, Father.

245
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,010
Zheng only used this much for the disaster relief.

246
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,810
He's quite frugal.

247
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,590
Canghe is remote.

248
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,620
Maybe he didn't spend much on maintaining relationships.

249
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,320
As for Zheng,

250
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,560
when you ask him to do something,

251
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,330
he will do it well.

252
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,860
But regarding civilities,

253
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,150
he is not as good as Jun.

254
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,480
Jun started from the Ministry of Rites.

255
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,140
Wuxiang is a big town.

256
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,380
It's inevitable for him

257
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,350
to have some social activities.

258
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,230
That's right.

259
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,440
There are a lot of social expenses.

260
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,260
But it's understandable.

261
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,640
He came to a new place.

262
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,350
He must show some courtesy

263
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,530
in order to do things smoothly.

264
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,410
Why won't Zheng do these?

265
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,380
Wuxiang Town values the way of the world,

266
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,890
so it might be difficult to get long-term development.

267
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,300
All your memorials for reporting

268
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,570
have been submitted.

269
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,350
You will be rewarded when you wait upon the Lord at bedtime.

270
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,870
Yes.

271
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,380
Prince is the most favored now.

272
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,290
Lady.

273
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,220
Madam He summoned you for a talk.

274
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,710
Why am I summoned by Madam He?

275
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,100
Your Ladyship.

276
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,070
Please.

277
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,770
Would you

278
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,120
copy all these scriptures

279
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,820
to calm down?

280
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,990
My Lady.

281
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,570
I'm pregnant

282
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,920
and my body is not agile.

283
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,040
I'm afraid it's inconvenient.

284
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,750
I know

285
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,940
your health is important.

286
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,700
I've asked them to stand by.

287
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,930
Stand by?

288
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,660
Are the four imperial physicians enough?

289
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,020
They'll keep eyes on everything.

290
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,140
Copying scriptures can make you concentrate,

291
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,160
then you'll have less delusions.

292
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,510
There is only a fine line between good and evil.

293
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,550
If the pregnant can't accumulate merits,

294
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,460
all good and bad will live together with your children.

295
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:56,980
Understand?

296
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,250
Yes.

297
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,230
Why aren't you writing?

298
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,590
[Be Humble and Study Hard]

299
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,880
Madam Xinchuan fell ill because of Yin Song.

300
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,910
Now a concubine is here to make decisions.

301
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,380
Lady,

302
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,480
walls have ears.

303
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,540
What am I afraid of?

304
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,720
They've stepped on my face.

305
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,650
Don't upset the baby.

306
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,160
Yes.

307
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,550
You're right.

308
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,370
I must do my best for my baby.

309
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,370
Prince Jun and I are both born of concubines.

310
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,760
We've been trampled on all our lives.

311
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,830
If we can't go on,

312
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,820
our children

313
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,630
will repeat our mistakes.

314
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,710
Go.

315
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,040
Bring me a brush and paper.

316
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,500
I am writing to Prince Jun.

317
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,090
At this time,

318
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,000
I can't be too soft-hearted.

319
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,160
Yes.

320
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,440
Noble Prince.

321
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,630
The snow is getting heavier.

322
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,760
If there is ice on the road,

323
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,840
we can't get out.

324
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,370
Sprinkle salt on the road.

325
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,700
The road won't freeze easily then.

326
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,760
We don't have that much salt.

327
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,390
Why do you look like a frozen persimmon?

328
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,430
A frozen persimmon?

329
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,610
Come on, warm up.

330
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,710
As if you've seen frozen persimmons before.

331
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,370
You haven't tried it, right?

332
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,300
It's delicious.

333
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,660
I told you this place is remote.

334
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,240
Isn't it good to stay in the county?

335
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,650
No.

336
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,620
You're sick.

337
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,610
I'm worried.

338
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,480
I just checked the mountain road.

339
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,560
The biggest problem is that the road is bad.

340
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,930
And the carts here are drawn by horses.

341
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,290
Replace them with mules.

342
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,200
The hooves of mules are bigger than those of horses.

343
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,920
They are more suitable for mountain roads than horses.

344
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,080
Even if the road is covered with ice,

345
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,940
they can get on the road with repaired hooves.

346
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,000
This is a good idea.

347
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,780
Really?

348
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,640
In my hometown, carts are often pulled by donkeys or mules.

349
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,970
They can run on any road.

350
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,370
Lady Wei, you're amazing.

351
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,880
Just like Noble Prince,

352
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,080
you know everything.

353
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,620
Yin Zheng.

354
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,440
Noble Prince!

355
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,240
Noble Prince!

356
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,120
Noble Prince!

357
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,520
Why is your head this hot?

358
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,380
This...

359
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,240
Have you got the plague?

360
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,270
Noble Prince.

361
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,500
Noble Prince.

362
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,800
Her Ladyship was punished to copy the scriptures for an hour.

363
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,600
It's not long.

364
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,890
But she felt bad.

365
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,900
The document I wrote was returned

366
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,600
without the Lord's remarks written in red.

367
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,220
We planned

368
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,240
to return in five days.

369
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,300
Go to Mr. Chu now

370
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,570
and tell him

371
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,140
the disaster is almost under control.

372
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,830
Ask him to handle the remaining problems.

373
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,760
Let's go back to the capital today.

374
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:49,980
Yes.

375
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,380
You know

376
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,550
what to do next.

377
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,440
Nothing can go wrong in the disaster relief.

378
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't worry, Prince.

379
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,830
I got it.

380
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
Prince Jun, wait.

381
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,540
Prince Jun.

382
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,920
Prince Zheng is seriously ill.

383
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,380
The doctors in Canghhe Town can't treat him.

384
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,870
Please find some good doctors.

385
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,570
Yes.

386
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,200
Please send doctors as soon as possible.

387
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Please calm down.

388
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,640
I'll go find someone.

389
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,240
Thank you.

390
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,440
Hurry up.

391
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,620
Make haste.

392
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,040
We should make a decision now.

393
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,440
Instead of regretting later,

394
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,750
I'd rather let others down

395
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,010
and put an end to it now.

396
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,770
Go to Magistrate Chu

397
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,090
and tell him.

398
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,680
At this time,

399
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,750
he can't let a single doctor out of the county.

400
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,060
Go.

401
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,480
Yes.

402
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,530
Lady Wei,

403
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,040
don't worry too much.

404
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,430
Lady Wei.

405
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:06,870
Look.

406
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,960
They are back.

407
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,510
Lady.

408
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,040
Where is the doctor?

409
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,080
The magistrate said

410
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,540
they're short of doctors.

411
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,120
What?

412
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,760
But the gazette clearly said

413
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,110
the refugees in Wuxiang County

414
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,640
have been placed properly.

415
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,800
How can they not let a single doctor out?

416
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,640
Where is Prince Jun?

417
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,560
He doesn't care either?

418
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,720
Prince Jun is leaving for Xinchuan today.

419
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,600
I knew something was wrong.

420
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,180
Yes.

421
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,940
Magistrate Chu promised to send someone.

422
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,740
But somehow he changed his mind.

423
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,160
He insisted that there is no doctor available.

424
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,010
I'm going to the county to kidnap.

425
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,240
I'll kidnap a doctor if I have to.

426
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,580
Stop!

427
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,680
I know you're loyal.

428
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,090
But you are registered in the military.

429
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,120
If you act without orders,

430
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,780
you'll only get into trouble.

431
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,970
Lady Wei.

432
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,850
Prince is awake.

433
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,650
I heard roughly

434
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,380
what you said outside.

435
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,080
Prince Jun went back to the capital first,

436
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,040
but I didn't go back.

437
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,640
His Majesty will surely ask.

438
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,850
If he wants to do something,

439
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,970
he'll only delay for a few days

440
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,280
until I die.

441
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
But don't worry.

442
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,300
I've read a few medical books.

443
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,780
I think it's a cold.

444
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,640
I'll be better if the fever is gone.

445
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,240
This matter can't be hidden.

446
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
People in the palace will find out sooner or later.

447
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,050
They will send someone.

448
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

449
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,910
Rise.

450
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,530
The disaster relief is not easy.

451
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,640
But when I thought I could share your burden,

452
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,440
I felt...

453
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,160
Thank you for your hard work.

454
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Why didn't Zheng come back with you?

455
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,190
Zheng caught a cold.

456
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,590
He's not feeling well.

457
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,170
He needs to rest for a few days.

458
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,990
How is he?

459
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,350
Canghe is far away.

460
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,650
Should we send imperial physicians from the palace?

461
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,120
He said he's fine.

462
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,500
He just needs to rest for a few more days.

463
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,360
Zheng doesn't like to make a fuss.

464
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,660
His concubine

465
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,370
has gone to take care of him.

466
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,270
She's an attentive person.

467
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,390
He must be fine.

468
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,280
You put so much Chinese thorowax.

469
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,680
Will this make him worse?

470
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,220
You're right.

471
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,620
Then remove some

472
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,450
or use Pinelliae Tuber Decoction.

473
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,920
Noble Prince has stomach problems.

474
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,720
Pinelliae Tuber Decoction can nurse his spleen and stomach.

475
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,680
It'll be good for him.

476
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,390
Yes.

477
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,900
It may not be a bad idea to follow the book.

478
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,120
Guys.

479
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,600
Time waits for no one.

480
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,760
If you have decided on a prescription,

481
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,080
I need to get the medicine.

482
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,680
Just wait.

483
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,360
How long have you been thinking about it?

484
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,110
The prescription often changes every three days at most.

485
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,770
Look at you.

486
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,040
You changed 72 times a day.

487
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
If you're so afraid of taking responsibility,

488
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,200
why did you choose to be a doctor?

489
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,160
The medicine he took

490
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,960
reduced his fever a bit.

491
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
But the fever came again at midnight.

492
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,050
When you figure out a way,

493
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,980
he'll be burned.

494
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,930
Step aside.

495
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,310
Lady Wei.

496
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,810
Those doctors have been sent away.

497
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,600
Following Prince Jun's order,

498
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,530
Magistrate Chu sent some doctors.

499
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,770
But none of those stupid doctors

500
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,310
dared to make a prescription.

501
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,770
Canghe Town is indeed far.

502
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,580
But it's been a few days, the imperial physicians should've arrived.

503
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,510
Unless he didn't send anyone here.

504
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,880
Prince Zheng was seriously ill when he was young.

505
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,920
I looked for imperial physicians in the palace all day.

506
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,190
It was difficult.

507
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,390
I thought now that

508
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,590
Prince did so much for Xinchuan.

509
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,000
His Highness should have him in his heart.

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,480
But...

511
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,590
Maybe they were delayed on the way.

512
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,700
Yuping.

513
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,490
Stop lying to yourself.

514
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,970
We lost our way and met bandits.

515
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,290
It only took us a while to get here.

516
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,670
It's like we're exiled now.

517
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,770
Stop talking nonsense.

518
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,090
God.

519
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,870
Open your eyes, God.

520
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,050
Look how nice our Prince is.

521
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,040
Don't let anything happen to him.

522
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,790
Don't panic.

523
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,710
Anyway,

524
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,610
let's reduce his fever first.

525
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,120
Medicine should not be eaten indiscriminately.

526
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,250
But food is OK, right?

527
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,380
You two come with me.

528
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,300
Prince.

529
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,290
The garlic porridge is not delicious.

530
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,150
Add some sugar.

531
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,120
OK.

532
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,230
Garlic can relieve coldness and clear the lungs.

533
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,430
Sugar can warm you up.

534
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:16,850
Salt.

535
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,930
Add some salt in the water every day.

536
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,470
It can replenish energy.

537
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,270
Yes, Lady Wei.

538
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,240
Lady.

539
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,900
We brought something here.

540
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,350
Lady.

541
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,850
Noble Prince is kind.

542
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,730
He gave me a chicken.

543
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,180
These are the eggs laid by the chicken.

544
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,380
I know a local recipe.

545
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,310
Break the egg in the yellow wine.

546
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,330
It can fend off the cold.

547
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,440
This is the yellow wine made by our villagers.

548
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,920
They're for the Noble Prince.

549
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,310
No.

550
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,440
I can't accept these.

551
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,790
Lady.

552
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,280
These cabbages are all delivered from outside.

553
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
The villagers hope the Noble Prince can recover soon.

554
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,310
Yes.

555
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,730
We hope the Noble Prince can recover soon.

556
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,930
Thank you, everyone.

557
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,050
But I can't accept these things.

558
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,570
Your Ladyship.

559
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,120
You can accept this, right?

560
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,360
This is the cloak the Noble Prince gave me.

561
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,220
I washed it, and now I return it to you.

562
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,320
Lady.

563
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,150
Thank you.

564
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,520
Thank you.

565
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,860
Thank you, everyone.

566
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,110
But the supplies are scarce.

567
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,210
Keep them for yourselves.

568
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,290
Thank you.

569
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:30,900
Sister.

570
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,170
Can you give this to the Noble Prince?

571
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,500
Noble Lady,

572
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,680
this is a little gift from a child.

573
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,910
Just accept it.

574
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,680
Yes, please accept it.

575
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,560
These are just some small gifts from the villagers.

576
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,520
Take them, Lady.

577
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,760
Thank you, everyone.

578
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,050
Great.

579
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,420
The fever is finally gone.

580
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,910
You know what?

581
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,120
Everyone you've helped here

582
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,430
sent you something.

583
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,790
We fed you salt water

584
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,590
and garlic porridge.

585
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,080
In the end, I used the local method from my hometown

586
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,240
and covered you with several layers of cotton blankets to make you sweat.

587
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
That's why you got rid of the plague.

588
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,260
You know I sleep soundly.

589
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,739
I'm afraid I won't know when you wake up.

590
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,960
It's better this way.

591
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,449
Thank you.

592
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,090
Not at all.

593
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,750
This is the first time

594
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,300
I've ever been so scared.

595
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,690
I was even more scared than

596
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,159
when I got lost in the forest alone.

597
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,929
Get well soon.

598
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,500
Yin Zheng.

599
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,050
We promised to live together forever.

600
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,570
We have to be

601
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,910
healthy, safe

602
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,720
and happy forever.

603
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,090
OK.

604
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
Prince is back from greeting the Lord and Madam this morning.

605
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,720
Here.

606
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,290
Have a seat.

607
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,400
Prince.

608
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,700
What's wrong?

609
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,630
Today, His Majesty asked me again

610
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,750
why Zheng hasn't come back yet.

611
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,780
He said he's worried

612
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,420
and wanted to send imperial physicians.

613
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,400
We haven't heard from him for days.

614
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,250
If the Lord wants to send imperial physicians,

615
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,340
send them there.

616
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,120
Canghhe Town is far away anyway.

617
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,340
When the imperial physicians arrive,

618
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,030
who knows if he's still alive?

619
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,700
Xiyuan.

620
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,990
Watch your mouth.

621
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,330
Prince, calm down.

622
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,850
You only told Magistrate Chu

623
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,800
to be extra careful at the later stage of the disaster relief

624
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,910
and keep all the doctors in the county

625
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,690
in case something happens.

626
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,410
As for

627
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,320
what Magistrate Chu did,

628
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,330
it's all based on his misunderstanding.

629
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,860
It's none of your business.

630
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,600
I never intended to harm him.

631
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,670
Prince.

632
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,200
I understand.

633
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,530
Your Majesty,

634
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,730
Her Ladyship is here to see you.

635
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,330
Let her in.

636
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,860
Yes.

637
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:32,750
My Lord.

638
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,550
What happened?

639
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,620
Get up.

640
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,240
Please forgive me for overstepping the bounds of propriety.

641
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,400
May I ask

642
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,480
if you are going to abandon Zheng?

643
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,870
What nonsense is that?

644
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,090
A rumor has been spreading for a while in the palace,

645
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,850
saying that Your Majesty ignored Zheng.

646
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,910
It's the same as exile.

647
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,560
You're leaving him in Canghe

648
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,560
to die.

649
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,870
Is there really such a rumor?

650
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,540
Your Highness,

651
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,880
there indeed are rumors in the palace,

652
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,320
but they're just nonsense.

653
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,570
How could the Lord abandon Prince Zheng?

654
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,860
This nonsense is ridiculous.

655
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,690
I dare not tell you.

656
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,820
Ridiculous!

657
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,110
Investigate!

658
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,670
You must trace the source.

659
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,360
Yes.

660
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,040
Since the rumor is false,

661
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,500
please send imperial physicians to Canghe.

662
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,520
I asked my mother's family.

663
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,560
They said that Zheng is seriously ill.

664
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,090
What?

665
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,330
Please

666
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,350
protect our son who I have wronged for many years.

667
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,880
My Lord.

668
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,370
My Lord.

669
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,360
My Lord.

670
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,350
Lady Wei, be careful.

671
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,260
This way.

672
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,360
The weather is so nice lately.

673
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,960
Yes.

674
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,890
Everything is getting better now.

675
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,600
Yin Zheng.

676
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,420
Why did you come out alone?

677
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,700
Why are you wearing so little?

678
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,960
You've recovered and forgot the pain?

679
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,290
I have good news for you.

680
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,000
His Majesty personally ordered

681
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,040
to summon you back to the palace.

682
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,970
He also sent imperial physicians.

683
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,490
Prince, Lady Wei.

684
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,030
Lady Wei took good care of you,

685
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,480
so you recovered quickly.

686
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,140
Physician Lin,

687
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,800
you came here for nothing.

688
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,710
You've recovered.

689
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,570
When are we going back to the palace?

690
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,640
Let's stay a few more days

691
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,700
and make things harder for the court.

692
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,190
You're indeed my Prince.

693
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,830
Don't you like snow?

694
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,400
This time, let's enjoy it to the fullest.

695
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,700
Prince Zheng is here.

696
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,420
Greetings, My Lord.

697
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,000
Zheng is back.

698
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,440
Are you all right?

699
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,160
Yes.

700
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Thank you for your concern, Father.

701
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,600
Yue.

702
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,660
Your brother went to the northwest for disaster relief.

703
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,590
He bore hardships, stood hard work

704
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,000
and was seriously ill.

705
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,570
He's back with glory today.

706
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,840
Why are you sneering?

707
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,020
Brothers should love and respect each other.

708
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,240
Even a three-year-old kid understands it.

709
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,870
What?

710
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,830
Do you need someone to teach you?

711
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:50,910
I dare not.

712
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:51,720
I...

713
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
I know I was wrong.

714
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,530
A fault confessed

715
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,620
is half redressed.

716
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,780
In this disaster relief,

717
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,520
Jun and Zheng did very well.

718
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,360
Zheng has recovered.

719
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,320
Come to court as soon as possible.

720
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:16,980
Yes.

721
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:22,200
Jun has worked especially hard this time.

722
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,860
I'll grant you a leave

723
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,800
for three months.

724
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,850
Go home and recuperate.

725
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,670
Have a good rest.

726
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,670
Father.

727
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,860
You're dismissed.

728
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,470
-Yes. -Father.

729
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,020
♫A star that hasn't slept♫

00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,160
♫I don't dare to get related♫

759
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,980
♫But you came to me♫

760
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,570
♫And lit up the stars in my sky♫
