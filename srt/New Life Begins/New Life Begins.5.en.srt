[Episode 05]

4
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,509
It hurts.

5
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,780
I taught them how to be a wife.

6
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,830
But they

7
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,660
put such a big cabbage in my mouth.

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,830
Nanny, you're framing me!

9
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,490
It's not...

10
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,600
It's not that big at all!

11
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,050
Look.

12
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,750
She admitted it.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,630
They just put the cabbage in my mouth.

14
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,730
It was I who did it.

15
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,180
It's despicable of you to get her punished.

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,910
You are all bitches!

17
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,729
Beat them!

18
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,140
Beat them at least 20 times!

19
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,650
What they did was way out of line.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,440
Enough.

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
It's enough to hit them 20 times.

22
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,090
The cabbage was put in my mouth, you know!

23
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,690
It's done.

24
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,190
How is it?

25
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,220
Does it hurt?

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,829
-It must hurt. -I'm fine.

27
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,310
You also got hit too, didn't you?

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,160
Does your back hurt?

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,370
I'm fine.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,700
Can you stand up?

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,850
Didn't Princess Shangguan get beaten?

32
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,390
Maybe this is bearable for a martial arts practitioner like her.

33
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,590
Prince Zheng is here.

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,780
Why is His Highness also called over here...

35
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,790
You should really discipline Mrs. Li.

36
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,470
If she keeps being arrogant,

37
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,040
and ignores Xinchuan's rules,

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,400
she will surely bring us great trouble in the future.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,950
You know it's hard for women in the inner courtyard.

40
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,350
Why must you make things difficult for her?

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,810
Shangguan.

42
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,590
How can you walk so fast after being beaten?

43
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,250
Wait for me.

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,740
Listen to me.

45
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,010
Let me carry you.

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,700
A good man will never let a weak woman walk alone.

47
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,230
Come!

48
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,710
No...

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,730
It's not because you're heavy...

50
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,680
The gun is too heavy.

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,490
Wait for me.

52
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,020
Hao Jia.

53
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:02,840
Come.

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,260
Here you go.

55
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,190
This is for you.

56
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,680
Are you okay?

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,970
Are you okay too?

58
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,340
Okay.

59
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,860
Never mind, I'm fine.

60
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,640
You should give it to Shangguan.

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,399
She looks tough,

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,760
but she must be feeling wronged.

63
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,930
It's okay. I have more.

64
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,010
I don’t need it.

65
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,010
Thank you, Your Highness.

66
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,540
Alright.

67
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,440
Take care on the way back.

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:26,890
Ouch!

69
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,990
Let's go.

70
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,760
I shall get some sunbathing.

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,940
My Lady, you've been in great trouble this time.

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,440
Nanny Yan reported it to the Ministry of Internal Affairs,

73
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,450
and even Prince Zheng will be punished together.

74
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,260
He's not only lost his monthly payment for this,

75
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,390
but also been punished to kneel in the ancestral temple.

76
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,580
Be careful.

77
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,840
Okay.

78
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,140
Yuping, Yuzhan.

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,780
Give me my brush and paper.

80
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,200
Okay.

81
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,950
Here you are, My Lady.

82
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,160
My Lady,

83
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,670
You want to write a letter home again?

84
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,040
I know the letter won't be able to arrive home.

85
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,700
You will all give it to Su Shen.

86
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,390
But it can at least leave me some hope.

87
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,590
It's not like that, My Lady.

88
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,650
No need to explain.

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,590
We're all under others' roof.

90
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,480
It's not easy for all of us.

91
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,360
I understand you.

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,890
It's not like that, My Lady.

93
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,540
We did hide the letter,

94
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,800
waiting for a chance to take it out.

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,690
If Her Ladyship knows

96
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,890
that her letters can't be sent out,

97
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,400
she'll surely be sad.

98
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
That's why I told you not to tell her the truth.

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,200
She's new to the mansion.

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,270
Just let her have more happy days.

101
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:49,430
But that day, Butler Su suddenly came to check the bedroom,

102
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,020
and confiscated all your letters.

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Yuping and I were scared,

104
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,370
so we didn't tell you.

105
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,409
Thank you.

106
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,340
I thought after I came to Xinchuan,

107
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,750
I would have no one to rely on

108
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,250
with no family by my side.

109
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,230
Thank you for being so nice to me.

110
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,670
I made a big mistake today.

111
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,210
I might have to pay with my life.

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
If letters can't be sent out,

113
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,150
then posthumous papers will do, right?

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,250
I've made a big mistake.

115
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,800
Perhaps... eight people will be needed to lift the coffin

116
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,300
so that my burial can be decent...

117
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,790
Are you a cat?

118
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,210
You're a cat.

119
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,430
Walking without sound...

120
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,410
If things go as what you write,

121
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,410
you need to be a cat with nine lives to pay off your debt.

122
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
I heard that you lost your monthly payment,

123
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,950
and were punished to kneel in the ancestral temple.

124
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,880
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
The money was indeed confiscated.

126
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,280
I did get punishment.

127
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,250
But it's not your fault.

128
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,100
Do you really think so?

129
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,570
When I was young,

130
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,630
I climbed trees in my private school to get sophora flowers.

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
My mother was called over to the school.

132
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,780
But my mother told the tutor

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,440
kids should be encouraged to do what they like.

134
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,830
What are you doing?

135
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,820
Don't move.

136
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,610
Actually, I didn't get any sophora flowers.

137
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,140
Instead, my leg got injured.

138
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,260
After I went back home,

139
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,640
my mother also treated me like this.

140
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,040
You really look like my mother.

141
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,810
I-I-I mean...

142
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,850
you treat me the same way my mother did...

143
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,230
It can just be sensed, you know...

144
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,760
You touched my feet with this hand!

145
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,370
Apply it yourself.

146
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,390
Your Highness.

147
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,350
I don't mind.

148
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,770
Your Highness.

149
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,310
I mind.

150
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,470
He is...

151
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,760
Your Highness,

152
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,760
may I ask

153
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,850
how you got hurt?

154
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,960
I got him...

155
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,490
Water!

156
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,370
She means she got a bucket of water.

157
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,290
I thought the water might be too heavy,

158
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,240
so I carried it for her,

159
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,810
but unfortunately fell.

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,210
This bruise doesn't look like a result of falling down...

161
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,540
It looks like you got kicked by a donkey...

162
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,170
No wonder you can be an imperial physician.

163
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,480
You really have keen eyes.

164
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
After I fell down,

165
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,300
a female donkey happened to come by,

166
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,220
and kicked me.

167
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:30,810
You...

168
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,700
Your Highness,

169
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,920
your bruise will recover in two days.

170
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,880
Well, I shall see myself out.

171
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
This way, please.

172
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,520
If there's nothing else, then I'm leaving.

173
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,040
Don't.

174
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,900
Shangguan,

175
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,950
listen to me.

176
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,680
Listen to me.

177
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,470
You haven't applied the ointment on your feet, have you?

178
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,330
I don't need it.

179
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,450
Alright.

180
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,320
No matter how good you are at fighting,

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,400
you still need ointment on your wounds.

182
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Come, sit down.

183
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,990
Sit down.

184
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,480
Give it to me.

185
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,610
You've given it to someone else, so you don't have to give it to me.

186
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,960
Who did I give it to?

187
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
You hit me like this.

188
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,480
And I'm still taking care of you.

189
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,610
Can't you be gentle?

190
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,450
Give it to me.

191
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,880
Hao Jia wouldn't be like this.

192
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,980
If you want to marry Hao Jia, marry her.

193
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
If you can't marry her, then shut up!

194
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,330
You want me to be like her?

195
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:32,990
Listen.

196
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,180
It's impossible even in the next life.

197
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,920
I didn't...

198
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,590
[Garden of Triumph]

199
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,920
Your Highness.

200
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
In the inner court study hall today,

201
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,380
the concubines of Prince Qi and Prince Zheng got punished.

202
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,840
Really?

203
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,040
I heard

204
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,380
they contradicted Nanny Yan

205
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,790
and even hit her.

206
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
Nanny Yan has been serving by Mother's side for a long time.

207
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,890
How can they be so unruly...

208
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,780
Hao Jia.

209
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,630
You always hang out with them.

210
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,090
Don't tell me that you're also behaving like them.

211
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,170
Hao Jia knows what to do.

212
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,350
Don't get close to them henceforth,

213
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,230
especially the one from Jichuan.

214
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,910
Yin Zheng is a scheming man.

215
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,930
This time, he made use of An's incident

216
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,850
to take credit in front of Father.

217
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,960
I believe she's not some good woman either.

218
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,690
Henceforth,

219
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
don't hang out with these guys.

220
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,360
Your Highness,

221
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,790
Li Wei is not an indecent person.

222
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,920
After staying with them for a long time,

223
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,040
you've learned to talk back to me?

224
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,550
I dare not.

225
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,260
Your Highness.

226
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,370
I went to see Mother today.

227
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,410
She's fully recovered.

228
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,360
I've sent her lots of tonics.

229
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,980
You should know

230
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,460
our Prince Song's mother is Madam.

231
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
What Yin Zheng is scheming

232
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,430
won't be of any use.

233
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,300
Well done.

234
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,960
By the way,

235
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,810
I asked the kitchen

236
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,380
to make some soothing white fungus soup.

237
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,710
After you're done with your work,

238
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,450
how about you come to my room and have some?

239
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,120
Okay.

240
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,750
My Lady, you can go to bed first.

241
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,550
Prince Song won't come tonight.

242
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,880
I thought I was here to work.

243
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,600
But actually I'm just a pet,

244
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,480
being petted when Prince Song's happy,

245
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,400
and kicked away when he's unhappy.

246
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,510
I really envy Li Wei and Shangguan Jing.

247
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,250
They can be so carefree.

248
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,740
I'm not like Shanggua Jing. She has a good family background.

249
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,350
And I'm not like Li Wei.

250
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,210
Her parents love her so much and support her in everything.

251
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,680
But my life now is better than before.

252
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,290
Marrying the Legitimate Eldest Prince

253
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,250
can make my mother's life easier

254
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,240
at home.

255
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,570
As long as I live through this life,

256
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,430
I can anyhow get something I want.

257
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,600
[Wenxin Hall]

258
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,450
Recently, there have been floods in Danchuan.

259
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,860
Our Lord has asked Lord Mochuan and Lord Daichuan to help.

260
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,050
But I'm afraid the rescue won't be in time.

261
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,630
I know what you mean, Sir.

262
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,600
Although Xinchuan issued the disaster-relief-edict,

263
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,400
Danchuan is in the flood season.

264
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,390
The disaster this year is more serious than the years before.

265
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,360
Let me take a look at this document and think of a way

266
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,020
so that I can write it in the article for the discourse on politics.

267
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,370
Your Highness,

268
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,820
if you can come up with a practical plan this time,

269
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,120
you will definitely be appreciated by Lord.

270
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,340
First of all, we need to deal with floods and take care of the refugees.

271
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,120
But the fertile fields are flooded and the refugees are lost...

272
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,920
What's important for now is how to recover farming and sericulture.

273
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,300
Was this dog sent by Concubine Wei?

274
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,420
Yes, Sir.

275
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,780
Forgive my overstepping.

276
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,050
I hope

277
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,010
you won't be trapped by love.

278
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,170
This is a rare opportunity.

279
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,550
If you can seize it,

280
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,490
you'll get a better legal wife

281
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,490
as you get promoted.

282
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,530
It won't last long to depend on others.

283
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,710
If I can get promoted

284
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,950
while well protecting my wife who's thought awful by others,

285
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,750
my life's gonna be more amazing!

286
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,410
I'll do my best.

287
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,360
But the future

288
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,990
depends on my ability.

289
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,420
My Lady,

290
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,900
what are you writing?

291
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,460
Prince Zheng is worth trusting.

292
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,800
I want to repay him

293
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,530
and help him get rid of his stomach trouble.

294
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,119
This is the recipe for him.

295
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,440
You finally thought it through!

296
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,950
What?

297
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,849
Nothing.

298
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,620
Fine...

299
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,410
Come, give me a hand.

300
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,030
Slowly.

301
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,630
Be careful.

302
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,040
Are you dissatisfied, Your Highness?

303
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,120
The floods in Danchuan are a matter of people's livelihood.

304
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,920
I feel there's something wrong.

305
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,740
Dear Zheng.

306
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,690
Aren't you tired?

307
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
Is there anything you want to eat?

308
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,970
I can make it for you.

309
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,660
I'm not hungry.

310
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,490
You can go out.

311
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
But I want to stay here with you.

312
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,180
What are you busy with?

313
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,640
-Recently, Danchuan has been... -Your Highness.

314
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,920
Your Highness.

315
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,840
This is the latest dessert I made for you. It's made of sophora flowers.

316
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,190
It's all made by Chef Liu?

317
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,320
It looks delicious.

318
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,420
When I was young,

319
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,530
I climbed trees in my private school to get sophora flowers.

320
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,860
Liu Baoquan,

321
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,520
It seems that

322
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,880
you're now getting very close to Concubine Wei.

323
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,360
Miss Song,

324
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,020
please don't say so.

325
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,980
Wait, Miss...

326
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,880
Your Highness, I...

327
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,040
Miss Song.

328
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,090
Miss...

329
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,490
There's a disaster in Danchuan again?

330
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,350
Your Ladyship.

331
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,830
What Prince Zheng is busy with is very serious.

332
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,280
Maybe you...

333
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,410
You know about the floods in Danchuan?

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,460
I've heard a little about it when I was young.

335
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,170
There were also floods in Jichuan during the flood season.

336
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,600
When it's really serious,

337
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,890
my family would hire refugees.

338
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,200
Because the price would be 30% cheaper

339
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,120
or even half cheaper.

340
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,540
What else?

341
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,040
Tell me more about it.

342
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,700
Once there was a flood,

343
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,990
my parents would make the fields,

344
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,250
the house and the granary all enclosed.

345
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,880
They would also keep dogs

346
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,270
to prevent the refugees from stealing grain,

347
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,670
hurting people, and destroying the house.

348
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,680
The refugees would escape because of the disaster.

349
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,000
After the natural disaster, less than 10% of the people would return.

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
The young people would settle down in other places.

351
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,360
If this goes on,

352
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,960
the loss of farmers will get more serious.

353
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,900
Danchuan is in its flood season.

354
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,320
You asked them to answer questions about the floods.

355
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,380
The idea's not bad.

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,260
The floods in Danchuan

357
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,000
have been haunting us year after year.

358
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,950
This is also what you've been worried about, My Lord.

359
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
Since the princes have been studying with me,

360
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,590
I should teach them to help share your burden.

361
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,600
But look, Qi's handwriting is really awful.

362
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,840
Even a crawling dog can write better than him.

363
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,040
Yin Song thinks to enlighten the people

364
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,200
should come before developing agriculture.

365
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
That's to say, to let the people learn farming skills.

366
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,260
Although it's right,

367
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,650
it's not easy to practice it.

368
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,280
But the article of the Legitimate Eldest Prince

369
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,010
has great parallel sentences.

370
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
It just looks great, but is actually unpractical.

371
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,660
The Fourth Prince also has interesting ideas.

372
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,810
He quoted the example of planting tangerines in Huainan

373
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,400
to show that the way of developing farming and sericulture can't be copied.

374
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,600
The local environment and population should be taken into consideration.

375
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,760
Jun has always been thoughtful.

376
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,650
Not bad.

377
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,690
I've also seen the Sixth Prince's article.

378
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,550
Zheng has indeed become more mature recently.

379
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,970
He's been sick before.

380
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,290
I didn't know he knew these.

381
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,130
Shennong created tilling tools

382
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,050
to benefit the people.

383
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,320
Emperor Yao asked four subjects to tell the people the proper time for farming.

384
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,110
Emperor Shun told Subject Hou Ji to prioritize grain production in politics.

385
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,320
Emperor Yu made the field system followed by all countries.

386
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,670
To make people live in peace and prosperity should come first, followed by enlightening them.

387
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,200
This is quoted from "Qimin Yaoshu"[China's first agricultural encyclopedia].

388
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,060
Zheng is really a doer.

389
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,190
He even mentioned the loss of farmers.

390
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,660
Without field visits,

391
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
he wouldn't have thought of so much.

392
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,330
Give these two articles to the Legitimate Eldest Prince

393
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,530
and let him read them.

394
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,960
And let Zheng come to see me here.

395
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,560
Yes, My Lord.

396
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,490
Greetings, Father.

397
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,150
I've read your article.

398
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,140
Good job.

399
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,640
Thank you, Father.

400
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,860
I have something to ask you.

401
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,420
The floods in Danchuan

402
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,580
made the transportation of supplies difficult there.

403
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,660
If it gets delayed on the way, it can easily rot.

404
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,860
What do you think?

405
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,860
It doesn't matter if you say something wrong.

406
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,430
Your Highness, you've finally come out.

407
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,680
Did Lord urgently summon you

408
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,130
because of your article?

409
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,270
Yep!

410
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,480
Father is very satisfied.

411
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,410
That's great.

412
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,850
But he also asked me another question.

413
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,520
I had an idea,

414
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
but I dared not say it.

415
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,300
If I tell him, it will prove

416
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,000
that he is wrong in building the Xindan Canal.

417
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
You can't say that.

418
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,040
How could Lord be wrong?

419
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,300
He's always right even if it's wrong.

420
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,880
Right.

421
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,390
Princess.

422
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,630
What are you waiting for?

423
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
Take all these out.

424
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Get all valuable things exchanged into gold and donated.

425
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,050
And this one.

426
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:35,740
Yes.

427
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,450
Hurry up.

428
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,420
Shangguan.

429
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,120
Why are you here?

430
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,990
We heard that there was a flood in Danchuan,

431
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,250
so we thought you'd send something home.

432
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,480
I have nothing good.

433
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,270
Just keep the jewelry.

434
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,800
And these.

435
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,790
These are from my friends and me.

436
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,390
Get them together sent away.

437
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,950
So much?

438
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,690
An has plenty of money.

439
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,460
The money shouldn't be wasted on him.

440
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,610
It should be used to help the people of Danchuan.

441
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,090
He's rewarded us a lot.

442
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,570
But we don't want to wear gold or silver for pleasing him.

443
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,160
I thank you on behalf of the people of Danchuan.

444
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
Don't worry too much.

445
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,210
I heard that Lord Xinchuan has sent more men

446
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,270
and allocated money.

447
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,530
Once the supplies arrive,

448
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,130
everything will get better.

449
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,260
Sisi?

450
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,800
I...

451
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,660
I want to donate some too.

452
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,100
Is this enough?

453
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,950
This is the newly made raw rib.

454
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,870
It can make your hair grow.

455
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,920
Baifu.

456
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,890
Please bless the people

457
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,900
to be happy and safe.

458
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,320
Baifu's lucky with you being able to enter the kitchen.

459
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,070
What kitchen?

460
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,440
What luck?

461
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,560
What Liu Baocquan can cook has always been the same.

462
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,090
How is he capable of making so many new dishes?

463
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,470
Sorry.

464
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:06,980
Look up.

465
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,790
No one will blame you.

466
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,180
It's not that easy to get along well with Liu Baoquan.

467
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,020
But you've managed to deal with him

468
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,030
in just a few days!

469
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,440
Nothing can't be broken.

470
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
I just adopted the suitable method.

471
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,860
How did you make everyone

472
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,600
like you?

473
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,250
People might think you like me too.

474
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,910
It's not impossible.

475
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,580
Are you a gong?

476
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,720
I'm sorry.

477
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,130
But you can't be so scary.

478
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,460
I find that

479
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,230
you always banter with me when having something on your mind.

480
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,760
I only bantered with you...

481
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,340
Tell me.

482
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,860
What happened?

483
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,860
As your concubine,

484
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,390
I should help share your burden.

485
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,350
I see.

486
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,520
You have an idea?

487
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,340
It doesn't need an idea.

488
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,370
Just be sincere.

489
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,820
Try not to see Lord just as Lord.

490
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,530
He is your family.

491
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,100
Just be honest with your family.

492
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,780
Family?

493
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,960
Family...

494
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,610
I can't stand this anymore!

495
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,930
She's even making use of a dog

496
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,210
to please dear Zheng.

497
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,560
I won't let her go.

498
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,730
Miss,

499
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,530
I've heard you say this eight times.

500
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,020
But you did nothing.

501
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,380
Wait, Miss.

502
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,310
What's wrong?

503
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,410
Our plan is...

504
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,970
You write a fake love letter and hide it here.

505
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,630
Then ask Butler Su to check it.

506
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,270
Tell him Li Wei committed adultery, right?

507
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,690
I've explained it to you in the room so many times.

508
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,090
Why are you still asking?

509
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,780
Just wait a little longer, Miss.

510
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,660
What now?

511
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,960
Have you ever thought that

512
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,350
Li Wei's handwriting is very awful,

513
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,560
but you were quite serious when you wrote this letter.

514
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,020
Prince Zheng can easily know this is not Li Wei's handwriting.

515
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,330
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

516
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,370
I saw that you were so ambitious

517
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,690
and bragged about your clever plan...

518
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,090
I dared not say anything.

519
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,420
How dare you say it now?

520
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,010
I'm afraid that you'll get me into trouble.

521
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,310
Retreat!

522
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,950
Don't shout, Baifu.

523
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,890
Don't shout.

524
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,210
Good boy, come here.

525
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,720
Come here.

526
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,790
Bai Fu.

527
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,160
Come on.

528
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,200
Don't shout.

529
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,000
Miss.

530
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,930
How about we teach Baifu a lesson?

531
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,970
Prince Zheng will think

532
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,360
Li Wei didn’t take good care of it

533
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,490
and will punish her.

534
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,310
Then let me get Baifu tortured

535
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,290
into a dog with no one able to recognize it.

536
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,850
Watch out, Your Highness.

537
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,270
What happened to you?

538
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,890
Does it hurt?

539
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:02,890
Here.

540
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,160
Your Ladyship...

541
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,130
Why did you make Baifu be like this?

542
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,600
It wasn't me.

543
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,440
Don't you know

544
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,620
who would do such childish things?

545
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,480
I was a little nervous about going to greet Father in the morning.

546
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,740
Seeing it be like this,

547
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,060
I feel much better.

548
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Don't be nervous.

549
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,050
It's just to talk with your own father.

550
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,080
If you're still nervous,

551
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,370
have a candy.

552
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,100
Why do you have everything on you?

553
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,690
I'll get going then.

554
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,040
What's wrong with you?

555
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,240
Why did you make Baifu

556
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,650
be like this?

557
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,750
It's beyond all recognition!

558
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,150
It's just

559
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,390
wearing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 90 flowers.

560
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,280
What are you holding?

561
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,480
What do you mean?

562
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,570
You mean I did it?

563
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
How could you say it was me?

564
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Do you have proof?

565
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,170
Who else in this yard

566
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,080
would play such a childish trick?

567
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,040
Fortunately, you accidentally

568
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,980
help calm His Highness's nerves.

569
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,640
Well done.

570
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,010
But don't do it again.

571
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,780
Get it back to what it was like.

572
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,510
Be good to it.

573
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,600
Stop pretending to be generous.

574
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,320
Just wait.

575
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,540
I'll make you suffer.

576
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,980
Lovely Baifu.

577
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,490
Greetings, My Lord.

578
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,410
You're here.

579
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,660
Do you have any idea?

580
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,210
How to get supplies transported from Xinchuan to Danchuan?

581
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,880
All right.

582
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,810
Just say it.

583
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,880
Since the door is closed,

584
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,030
I'd like to say something to you as your son.

585
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,850
Go ahead.

586
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,080
The supplies transported to Danchuan were damaged

587
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,480
because they were transported by water.

588
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,190
So you think the supplies should be transported by land?

589
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,060
Yes.

590
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,920
Back then, I ignored the opposition of the officials

591
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,510
to build the Xindan Canal

592
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,270
so that the supplies can be transported within a shorter time.

593
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,699
Now you also think it's wrong?

594
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,489
I don't think it's wrong.

595
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,679
The Xindan Canal has brought great benefits to both Xinchuan and Danchuan.

596
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,190
But water transport can be greatly affected by the weather.

597
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,040
The weather in Danchuan is fickle and unpredictable.

598
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,900
If this goes on,

599
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,670
it may be hard to solve such problems.

600
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,750
So my suggestion is that

601
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,440
we can carry out land transport at the same time.

602
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,900
It's a long-term solution to transport by both water and land.

603
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,000
Li Wei.

604
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,070
Look at your bad idea.

605
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,520
Dear Zheng is confining himself in his room!

606
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,320
That's right.

607
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,200
Your Ladyship.

608
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,330
I'm not blaming you.

609
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,850
Prince Zheng didn't grow up by Lord's side.

610
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,050
He has long been ignored.

611
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,980
Your suggestion

612
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,010
has made things more difficult for him.

613
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,650
Exactly.

614
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,960
What?

615
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,490
Exactly.

616
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,240
Your Highness, why are you here?

617
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,590
You're not in your room?

618
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,640
Your Highness.

619
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,360
Are you all right?

620
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,730
Did Lord punish you?

621
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,430
Let me hit Li Wei for you.

622
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,400
Lord...

623
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,620
was very pleased.

624
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,680
He asked me to hold the Mid-Autumn Palace Banquet.

625
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,440
Really?

626
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,400
Really?

627
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,020
Here, I bought you liquor.

628
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,600
Great.

629
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,600
Our Prince Zheng is finally appreciated by Lord.

630
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,210
Have a seat.

631
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,210
Let's drink.

632
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,470
Your Highness, you're unable to drink.

633
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,480
I'm treating you.

634
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,150
Okay.

635
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,620
Let's get drunk.

636
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,570
One,

637
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,730
two,

638
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,250
three...

639
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,990
Then you can just watch us drink.

640
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,090
Let's drink.

641
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,460
Fill it.

642
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,990
It's okay.

643
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,980
Your Ladyship.

644
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,550
Here's to you.

645
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,630
Miss Song

646
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,250
-Here's to you. -Can I also drink?

647
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,090
Sure.

648
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,600
Come on.

649
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,480
Let's congratulate our Prince.

650
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,920
Cheers, Your Highness.

651
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,650
Congratulations, dear Zheng.

652
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,360
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

653
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,470
I miss you so much.

654
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,040
I miss my mother's hand-made mooncakes.

655
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,350
For the Mid-Autumn Palace Banquet,

656
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,620
if I can help Prince Zheng manage it well,

657
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,530
I may be able to meet Lord Xinchuan

658
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
and ask him for a favor

659
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,790
to allow my family to reunite with me in the palace.

660
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,530
Prince Zheng treats me nicely,

661
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,890
so don't worry about me.

662
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,980
Father. Mother.

663
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,970
I can't send a letter to you.

664
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,730
I can only express my missing of you

665
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,260
in our hometown's way.

666
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,090
After Concubine Wei knew that she couldn't send the letters home,

667
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,690
she put her letter on the sill

668
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,700
with red beans covering it,

669
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,930
and expressed her missing her family

670
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,960
to the moon.

671
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,470
I specially copied the letter.

672
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,470
Please have a look

673
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,130
to know her intentions.

674
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,100
I told you not to peek.

675
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,900
I read it aboveboard.

676
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,820
I know it's not good.

677
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,820
But I just want to tell you that

678
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,520
Concubine Wei is no longer as mischievous as before.

679
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,400
She didn't write anything against the rules.

680
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,000
Just saying she misses home.

681
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,520
She said you treated her well

682
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,050
and reassured her parents.

683
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,840
Is she homesick?

684
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,870
Of course.

685
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,240
Everyone gets homesick when Mid-Autumn Festival's coming.

686
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,040
Concubine Wei is making mooncakes in the kitchen.

687
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,530
How about this?

688
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,340
Henceforth,

689
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,650
you can say her letters are written by me

690
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,450
and send the letters out for her.

691
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,630
Just don't let others know.

692
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,740
By the way, one more thing.

693
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,530
I will do as you say, Your Highness.

694
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,500
Your Ladyship,

695
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,770
we have to clean up quickly.

696
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,750
We'll be in trouble if Butler Su sees us.

697
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,290
But don't worry.

698
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,070
I won't betray you

699
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,270
even if we get caught.

700
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,690
What's going on?

701
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,050
Please don't blame me.

702
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,160
Concubine Wei did all these.

703
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,690
It has nothing to do with me.

704
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,880
Does it matter who did it?

705
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,610
Your Ladyship, are you okay?

706
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,610
Is everyone okay?

707
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,430
Let's clean up.

708
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,420
Okay.

709
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,260
Your Highness,

710
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,380
I have something to tell you.

711
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,560
Yesterday, you said

712
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,620
Lord Xinchuan asked you to hold the Mid-Autumn Festival Banquet.

713
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,960
That's true.

714
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,510
Can you leave this to me?

715
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,680
T-T-This was an accident.

716
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,280
Your Highness, don't worry.

717
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,600
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

718
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,470
I promise I'll do it well

719
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,020
and make it ingenious.

720
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,530
Here's what I think.

721
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,720
Is it OK?

722
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,200
Please.

723
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,260
Fine.

724
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,220
Really?

725
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,980
Your Highness, you are so nice.

726
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,280
You...

727
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,390
I'll get back to work.

728
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,290
Wait.

729
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,400
I'll arrange for you

730
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,590
the members needed for the banquet.

731
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,320
Don't worry.

732
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,460
Su Shen.

733
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

734
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,760
Your Ladyship.

735
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,990
Your Ladyship, I...

736
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,470
I was scared. I didn't mean it.

737
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,560
This...

738
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:29,960
It's good.

739
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,160
It's quite delicate.

740
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,050
Cuttie Yin.

741
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,020
Is the boat fun?

742
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,530
So cute.

743
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,480
The dishes are good.

744
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,100
Nice.

745
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,050
Brother.

746
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:44,750
Brother!

747
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,230
An.

748
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,550
-This... -Hai Tang.

749
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,610
Brother!

750
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,220
Zheng.

751
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,320
It's your first time holding the Mid-Autumn Festival Banquet.

752
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,680
I don't blame you for your lack of experience,

753
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,480
but you can't act so recklessly.

754
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,900
You want everyone to eat standing up?

755
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,020
Right, Zheng.

756
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,170
This is not thoughtful at all.

757
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,010
We're fine with this.

758
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,560
But do you want Lord Xinchuan, Madam Xinchuan,

759
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,160
and the Legitimate Eldest Prince and his wife to stand together?

760
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,060
Lord and Madam are here.

761
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,550
Father.

762
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,660
Rise.

763
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,410
It's lively.

764
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:39,270
Father.

765
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,610
Yin Zheng wants us to stand up

766
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,130
to experience plain folk's life?

767
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,990
He didn't even prepare a chair.

768
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,560
This is a running water banquet.

769
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,280
♫What's the finest delicacy in the world?♫

770
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:25,360
♫Heating up a pot of tea and feeling the time pass by silently♫

771
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:29,790
♫Apricot flowers flowing in the stream where fish is thriving♫

772
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:33,850
♫Just drink up the fine wine in our glass♫

773

♫What are you longing for in the passage of time?♫

♫Boiling morning dew that reflects the moon and starlight♫

♫Snow falling in winter, drunk in the spring breeze♫

♫Followed by poetic charm and pictorial splendor♫

777
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,900
♫Despite the various beautiful scenery all year round♫

778
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,510
♫The most fortunate thing is my encounter with you♫

779
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,890
♫Watching the myriad twinkling lights and dim candlelight of the city♫

780
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,660
♫One of them is waiting for me to come home♫

781
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,850
♫Ordinary meals can be so tasty and enjoyable♫

782
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,990
♫The most important thing is to be with you every day♫

783
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,410
♫It's the best time of harvesting red carps and green plums♫

784
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,440
♫The finest delicacy in the world♫

785
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,300
