[Episode 29]

4
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,390
Hurry up.

5
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,570
Hurry up.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,420
Place your bets.

7
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,820
What are you waiting for?

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
They are all mine.

9
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,910
Boss Xi,

10
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,950
aren't we here to seek refuge with Prince Song?

11
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,539
Why did he leave us here?

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,900
We should never talk behind the Legitimate Eldest Prince's back.

13
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,300
As long as we are loyal to the Second Prince,

14
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,680
he will promise us a bright future.

15
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Cheers.

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,980
Go on.

17
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,000
Place your bets.

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,130
Are you cheating?

19
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,950
Who cheated?

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,900
Where are you putting your hands?

21
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,560
Take them all.

22
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,690
Keep them alive.

23
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,620
Guards!

24
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,370
Yes.

25
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,040
Get him inquisited by torture.

26
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,610
Yes.

27
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,290
Yin Zheng.

28
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,210
Kill me if you dare.

29
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,430
If I get afraid a little bit,

30
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,790
you can humiliate me as you like!

31
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,860
I haven't told you my name yet,

32
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,790
and you already know I'm Yin Zheng.

33
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,590
It seems that the Legitimate Eldest Prince has talked about me a lot.

34
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,270
Bull shit.

35
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,980
I don't know him at all.

36
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,970
The rest of the guys have confessed it.

37
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,930
Don't trick me.

38
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,890
They have nothing in hands.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,560
They can't testify against anyone.

40
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,320
As for you,

41
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,210
you've forced me to confess by torturing me.

42
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,870
According to Xinchuan's law,

43
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,579
the testimony you gain in this way is illegal.

44
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,070
Really?

45
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,060
Boss Xi is so stubborn.

46
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,170
Looks like Brother has promised you a really great future.

47
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,770
But a fugitive like you

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,260
wouldn't want to be manipulated by Brother.

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,980
You must have something against him.

50
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,970
Maybe a letter he wrote to you?

51
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Prince Zheng.

52
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,510
So imaginative you are, huh!

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,570
What damn letter?

54
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,140
I don't have it at all.

55
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,610
I can search for it at all places

56
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,600
if you don't tell me.

57
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,220
After you entered the city, I sent someone to tail you.

58
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,450
You went to the courier station,

59
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,190
the restaurant,

60
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,630
the tea house,

61
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,060
and the pawnshop.

62
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,730
You don't lack money.

63
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,770
Why did you go to the pawnshop?

64
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,630
[Take a wide view]

65
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,770
Your handwriting is getting better, Your Highness.

66
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,830
You have no idea.

67
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,210
No, I don't.

68
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,300
But I know

69
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,400
you will feel aches in your arms

70
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,159
after writing for a long time.

71
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,620
So please listen to the imperial physician,

72
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
get more hot-compress therapy

73
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,340
when you have time.

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,990
Father always says

75
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,500
I have the best handwriting among my brothers.

76
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,940
[Gallop]

77
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,210
But only by practicing hard

78
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,490
[Fancy]

79
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,330
can I make him satisfied.

80
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,810
The handwriting is ready.

81
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,940
Go and frame it.

82
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,580
I'll show it to Father tomorrow.

83
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes.

84
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,580
Your Highness.

85
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,830
Prince Zheng has gone to get the evidence.

86
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,990
Let's send the guys to the Department of Penalty and Prisons as soon as possible.

87
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,650
-Yes. -Yes.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,310
Go.

89
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,680
You're back.

90
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,830
Are you hurt?

91
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,080
I'm fine.

92
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,870
Is everything going well?

93
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,650
I found the evidence.

94
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,280
We have the evidence now.

95
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,880
Why are you still unhappy?

96
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,580
If I report this to Lord,

97
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,679
the Legitimate Eldest Prince will have no chance to escape death.

98
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,610
I've thought about it countless times

99
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,350
to give an eye for eye.

100
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,880
But now, when it's really the time to do so,

101
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm kinda unable to make up my mind.

102
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,120
People in the countryside always store apples in the cellar.

103
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,910
If one of the apples in a basket is rotten,

104
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,180
the rest will also rot.

105
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,160
So there's no other way.

106
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,860
The only way is to pick out the rotten one.

107
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,490
One may have no chance

108
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,460
when reaching a certain position.

109
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,560
What if I also become like that?

110
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,800
You won't.

111
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,370
You are not a bad person.

112
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,370
Even if one day

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,490
you really make mistakes over something,

114
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,160
I still won't leave you.

115
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,890
I will beat you, scold you,

116
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,040
and wake you up.

117
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,000
Why are you still here?

118
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,140
Stand up.

119
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,260
Don't you listen to me?

120
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,480
If you insist on going against Brother,

121
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
how will you get along with Brother in the future?

122
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Father...

123
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,740
What will Father think of you?

124
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,580
Some things can be avoided from harm.

125
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,210
But if a prince breaks the law

126
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,460
regardless of right or wrong,

127
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,420
then what's the meaning of being an official?

128
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,610
You are not an official.

129
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,280
You've been suspended from your duties.

130
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,440
Actually I shouldn't be here right now.

131
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,880
But my sincere feelings for you

132
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,680
drove me here.

133
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,280
I'm really afraid that you'll go to a dead end.

134
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,700
You're enraging Lord.

135
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,370
An.

136
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,590
I'm not acting on impulse.

137
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,060
Lord is the lord of the people.

138
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,330
The law is also the law of the people.

139
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,890
As the governor of Xinchuan,

140
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,970
I believe Lord will have his own decision.

141
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,380
Please come in, Prince Zheng.

142
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,320
Zheng.

143
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,710
[Take a wide view and set free your fancy.]

144
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,320
I investigated the case without permission during my suspension.

145
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,180
I'm willing to be punished without any complaints.

146
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,440
But the case of counterfeit notes has been solved.

147
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,100
Please make a decision, Lord.

148
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,620
[One should never make counterfeit notes no matter how profitable it is; the right way to pursue promotion should be obeying Lord's summons and being a good official.]

149
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,640
According to Xinchuan's law,

150
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,470
your brother

151
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
should get the extreme penalty.

152
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,660
Princes should get punished

153
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,830
equally with the commoners.

154
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,070
But according to Article 236 of the Criminal Law,

155
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,820
if the prince is willing to confess his crime to the people,

156
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,450
it's allowed to exile him to the border,

157
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,810
and exempt him from the death penalty.

158
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:58,920
Lord.

159
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,430
Let me massage it for you.

160
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,180
The headache is a chronic disease.

161
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,670
Without strong medicine,

162
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,510
it can never be radically cured.

163
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,230
Zheng has thought of everything.

164
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,590
He investigated the case without permission and broke the law.

165
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,530
But since he found the evidence,

166
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,550
I can't punish him, or others may accuse him.

167
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,220
He even made the decision of how to punish Song

168
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,310
for me.

169
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,490
To exile Song to a desolate place

170
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,820
so that he can be exempted from death.

171
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,460
I can only

172
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,860
do as he said.

173
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,130
Lord.

174
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,970
Prince Zheng did so

175
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,220
not just for his own good.

176
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,890
It's also for saving your son's life.

177
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,150
He did not only do it for himself.

178
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,420
But why must he do this?

179
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,130
Everyone has eyes.

180
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,060
It can be seen clearly.

181
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,120
He has really put lots of efforts to it.

182
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,060
Song's skills in handwriting

183
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,400
were taught by me myself.

184
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,830
His handwriting is getting better.

185
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,640
It's like being written by a man of noble character.

186
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,240
But he himself is of no noble character.

187
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,580
I'm just an illegitimate child.

188
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Only I know

189
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,050
how much I've lost

190
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,490
for coming this far.

191
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,560
From then on, I've been thinking

192
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,329
I must make my Legitimate Eldest Prince well raised up.

193
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,619
Since he's the Legitimate Eldest Prince,

194
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,280
I wouldn't let him experience

195
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,790
what I experienced before.

196
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,069
I thought I should be strict with him,

197
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,890
and raise him up

198
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,630
so that he would have a smooth life.

199
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,250
But in the end...

200
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,860
Perhaps after this,

201
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,220
Prince Song will come to realize his error.

202
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,350
Greetings, Father.

203
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,650
Come here.

204
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,860
Father, you're in a great mood today?

205
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,320
Inviting me to the place where you taught me.

206
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,950
Your handwriting

207
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,780
reminds me of the past.

208
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,420
So I brought it here.

209
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,410
Back then,

210
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,280
you just practiced writing on that table.

211
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,600
You always couldn't write with firm strokes,

212
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,590
so you kept practicing.

213
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,730
That's how your handwriting becomes so good now.

214
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,600
Father, it was you who helped me

215
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,370
write down the first stroke in my life.

216
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,960
It took me half a month

217
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,740
to only teach you how to hold the brush.

218
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,000
Each time I corrected your wrong manner,

219
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,320
you would forget it the next day.

220
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,150
Yes.

221
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,320
About how the five fingers should be positioned for holding the brush,

222
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,720
I always

223
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,280
couldn't master it.

224
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,270
I'm dull.

225
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,180
Back then,

226
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,890
you only came up to my knees.

227
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,170
You wore an apricot coat,

228
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,610
and was even not able to sit steadily on a broad chair.

229
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,370
Then I taught you to sit upright.

230
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,470
But no matter how you struggled

231
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,570
to sit steadily,

232
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,260
you never leaned back.

233
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,140
You even didn't dare

234
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,280
to hold the arms of the chair.

235
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,120
When you were three,

236
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,330
you went to the Prince Study Hall for studying.

237
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,860
When you were ten years old,

238
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,960
the officials submitted a petition.

239
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,350
I hereby made a decree

240
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,550
to pick an auspicious day and announce your title to the officials.

241
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,250
I asked you to worship the ancestors, the Heaven and Earth, and Confucius.

242
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,140
Before that, you even asked the the Ministry of Rites to teach me

243
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,060
for half a month.

244
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,460
But on that day,

245
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,640
I couldn't remember at all

246
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,280
what saints I worshiped.

247
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,310
I scolded you harshly that day.

248
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,140
Yes.

249
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,760
After you punished me,

250
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,260
you told the others to leave.

251
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,040
You patted my head and said,

252
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,690
"I know you were scared,

253
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,460
but I was scared too."

254
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,760
You still remember that.

255
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,580
Of course I do.

256
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,530
That's because I hoped to protect the simplicity that you had as a child

257
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,500
when others expected too much from you.

258
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,690
But

259
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,360
I still had to leave the most important task to you.

260
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,570
So I could only be harsh on you.

261
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,500
I understand it.

262
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,970
No matter how harsh you are to me,

263
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,240
it's for my own good.

264
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,370
In a blink of an eye,

265
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,770
you've grown up.

266
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,890
The day you entered the study hall

267
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,030
seems to be yesterday.

268
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,710
Did you ask me here

269
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,400
for something important today?

270
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,290
Nothing.

271
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,530
Song.

272
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,160
Don't you have anything

273
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,820
to tell me?

274
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,620
I know Father's always busy.

275
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,560
I wish you

276
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,180
health.

277
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,050
I'm tired today.

278
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,620
Go back and rest.

279
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,710
Yes.

280
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,620
I'll take my leave.

281
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,640
Take it to the Department of Penalty and Prisons.

282
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,630
Let them do

283
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,240
according to what's suggested on this memorial.

284
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,440
Yes.

285
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,160
Father.

286
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,470
Father!

287
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,820
Father!

288
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,120
I have to see Father!

289
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,950
Step aside.

290
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm the Legitimate Eldest Prince!

291
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,050
How dare you!

292
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,000
Step aside!

293
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,100
Father.

294
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,850
Please think twice, Father.

295
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,080
It was Yin Zheng who covets the throne and slanders me.

296
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
Father, please don't listen to this treacherous guy,

297
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,310
and depose the Legitimate Eldest Prince due to a slander.

298
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,670
There has never been a precedent.

299
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,270
Please think twice, Father.

300
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,990
Father!

301
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,080
Father!

302
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,850
Father,

303
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,320
you've long been thinking about deposing me, right?

304
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,080
The Legitimate Eldest Prince has misbehaved

305
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,820
and should be deposed according to the law.

306
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,530
From now on,

307
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,400
just reflect on yourself.

308
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,190
You've made the decision

309
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,720
on the day you summoned me to the study hall, right?

310
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,410
Since you made up your mind,

311
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,400
why didn't you even dare to tell me face to face?

312
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,390
Feeling guilty?

313
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,300
Why would I feel guilty?

314
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,410
You keep saying that I'm the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

315
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,010
You said you would entrust me

316
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,250
with the future of the Nine Regions.

317
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,190
But you've been supporting Zheng.

318
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,740
You just want to set me up with him.

319
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,820
How dare you!

320
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,290
You used to break the rules.

321
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,300
I've spared you.

322
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,430
Now, you've made such a big mistake.

323
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,360
How can you still occupy this position?

324
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,870
At this point,

325
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,960
you're still accusing your brothers of scheming against you.

326
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,290
It's you who are the most scheming person.

327
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,240
You don't deserve the position.

328
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,730
I only regret not deposing you earlier.

329
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,850
I schemed against my brothers.

330
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,180
I don't deserve the position.

331
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,750
That's all learned from you.

332
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,130
As a father,

333
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,980
have you ever stopped scheming against your sons once?

334
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,670
You appointed me as the Legitimate Eldest Prince,

335
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,950
but have you ever trusted me?

336
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,810
Among my brothers,

337
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,520
you finally found Zheng might be useful.

338
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,170
So what?

339
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,700
Is he used for forcing me to work hard or as my backup?

340
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,400
You caused me trouble once and again.

341
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,250
You asked us to get practice in court.

342
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,600
But you would just punish us if we failed to do well,

343
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,980
or be suspicious of us if we did well.

344
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,790
What kind of father is this?

345
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,400
If you have any shame...

346
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,150
Father,

347
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,080
even if you schemed against us,

348
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,840
I still think it's just what you had to do

349
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,720
on the supreme position.

350
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,660
After all, you are a father.

351
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,160
But about the future you promised me and Mother,

352
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,630
you won't lie, right?

353
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,800
I was too naive.

354
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,080
But Father,

355
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,290
you should take the responsibility

356
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,220
for every mistake I made!

357
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,560
Prince Song, stop it.

358
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,930
Drag him out.

359
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,950
You don't deserve to be a father.

360
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
You don't deserve it.

361
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,870
You forced me to be like this!

362
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,660
It's all because of you!

363
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:34,220
[Garden of Triumph]

364
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,290
Are you so idle?

365
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,510
Coming specially to laugh at me?

366
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,200
Shouldn't you be busy with taking over my Ministry of Revenue?

367
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,060
The Ministry of Revenue is not yours.

368
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,380
It belongs to the people.

369
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,490
No need to say such high-sounding words to me.

370
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,840
You've overstepped the line and interfered with affairs in my Ministry of Revenue.

371
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,040
And you also secretly

372
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,090
drew ministers over to your side.

373
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,040
Do you really think I don't know what you want?

374
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,560
You want to strengthen your status with the Ministry of Revenue.

375
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,360
You gained profits from it to fill your own pocket.

376
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,370
But it doesn't mean everyone will be like you.

377
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,070
Only Father would believe your nonsense.

378
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,780
How would I believe that?

379
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,940
You did everything

380
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,550
just to get yourself promoted, didn't you?

381
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,000
That's right.

382
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,980
Only by getting the position can I fulfill more duties.

383
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,070
I know I can do better.

384
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,900
Why should I always let others have the upper hand?

385
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,750
But your suffering today

386
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,410
has nothing to do with me.

387
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,600
You deserve it.

388
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,330
You don't deserve the position.

389
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,020
I don't deserve the position.

390
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,700
The same excuse again.

391
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,110
When Father gave me the seal,

392
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,980
he told me,

393
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,630
"you're the Legitimate Eldest Prince,

394
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,170
you should take the responsibility."

395
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,140
Mother also told me

396
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,920
that everything would be mine in the future.

397
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,250
But after that,

398
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,640
Father never said that again.

399
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,570
As long as I did anything wrong,

400
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,260
he would say, "you don't deserve the position."

401
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,850
You are the son Father values the most.

402
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,340
All these years, he has never treated you badly.

403
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,320
If even you feel dissatisfied,

404
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,780
then how could his illegitimate sons like me

405
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,350
have a place to stand?

406
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,810
He valued me at the beginning,

407
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,240
so he suppressed me,

408
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,640
spied on me,

409
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,580
and got me tightly controlled.

410
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,780
You think you're the only one who suffered?

411
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,280
I was born as the Legitimate Eldest Prince.

412
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,820
Everyone wanted me to shoulder the responsibility of the Nine Regions.

413
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,170
I must learn everything I hated to do.

414
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,320
But Father

415
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,360
could never be satisfied.

416
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,670
All these years,

417
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,900
I've never had one night's good sleep.

418
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,690
With so many brothers,

419
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,430
I must beware

420
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,340
of your surpassing me one day,

421
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,450
or being more appreciated by Father.

422
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,610
I've been restless.

423
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,010
I was always afraid

424
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,860
of letting Father down.

425
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,330
But as a 30-year-old man,

426
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,410
I could only live by reading Father's face every day...

427
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,000
If he thinks I'm unworthy of the position,

428
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,770
then don't promise me that it's all mine.

429
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,360
As long as I do something wrong,

430
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,380
he would just get someone like you

431
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,780
to take away everything that belongs to me.

432
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,730
But let me tell you,

433
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,139
in this palace,

434
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,739
as long as you get a moment of joy,

435
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,790
there will be eternal sorrow following.

436
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,060
You

437
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,989
will also end up like me.

438
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,510
Those who climb up

439
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,260
should be prepared for a heavy fall.

440
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Lord granted liquor to Prince Song.

441
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,150
Since this is Father's order,

442
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,020
just do it then.

443
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,700
Be careful, Brother!

444
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,420
You must die for what I suffered!

445
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,650
Chen Xi.

446
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,930
I didn't betray you.

447
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,530
Why did you murder me?

448
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,400
If it weren't for you,

449
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,380
I wouldn't have lost everything.

450
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,620
I won't let you go even if I die!

451
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,640
Call the imperial physician!

452
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,490
Brother!

453
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,370
Brother!

454
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,560
Call the imperial physician!

455
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,110
Hurry!

456
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,670
How could you risk your life

457
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,930
for a bad guy, and even get yourself hurt?

458
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,010
Um...think about it.

459
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,840
If he had died when I was visiting him,

460
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,320
I would have been in trouble.

461
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,910
It's obviously because you're softhearted.

462
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,110
Now you know it hurts?

463
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,380
Your Highness.

464
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,530
New dishes you invented today?

465
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,440
Wanting me to be the poison-taster?

466
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Then how about I poison you to death?

467
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,330
Come on.

468
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,320
Is it good?

469
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,170
Not bad.

470
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,670
Though it's simply porridge and tofu,

471
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,040
this tofu has four flavors.

472
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,760
The signature blending type.

473
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,640
The classic smoky type.

474
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,710
The lemon pepper and buttered garlic types.

475
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,860
These four flavors

476
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,740
are made by Her Ladyship herself.

477
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,640
Thank you.

478
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,720
You're welcome.

479
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,580
Your Highness!

480
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,690
Your Highness!

481
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:03,880
Your Highness!

482
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,740
Your Ladyship.

483
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,300
Lord is here to see you.

484
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,960
We shall take our leave.

485
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,560
Yes.

486
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,240
Your Ladyship, please.

487
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,300
The dishes!

488
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,300
Hurry up.

489
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,160
Lord Xinchuan is here.

490
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,500
Father.

491
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
I heard from Song that

492
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,150
you suddenly noticed that the poisonous liquor

493
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,530
was not given by me?

494
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,950
Why would you be so sure?

495
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,790
Although you are the lord,

496
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,990
as a father, you would protect your own son.

497
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,590
If I hadn't known your personality,

498
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,200
I wouldn't have searched through the Criminal Law

499
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,870
to find an article

500
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:09,730
that can save the Legitimate Eldest Prince's life.

501
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,650
I didn't expect

502
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,410
you would think so.

503
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,080
Father.

504
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,610
I'm fine.

505
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,340
Never mind.

506
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,070
Prince Zheng.

507
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,400
You've done well for protecting your brother.

508
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,040
This is an act of benevolence and generosity.

509
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,310
I shall give you this jade token.

510
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,580
In the future,

511
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,660
if you want anything,

512
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,560
as long as it's lawful,

513
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,590
I will permit it.

514
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,880
Thank you, Father.

515
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,480
All right.

516
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,420
Just recuperate.

517
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,560
You can return to the court when you recover.

518
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:01,660
Yes.

519
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,110
Prince Zheng will soon go back to the court.

520
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,510
I believe our restaurant

521
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,960
can be reopened soon.

522
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,770
But we can't stay idle these days.

523
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,850
This is my new work plan.

524
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,600
In preparation for the reopening,

525
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,460
we need to raise some silver cash.

526
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,030
Now the inventory has almost been cleared.

527
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,720
We've kinda saved up enough money to reopen the restaurant.

528
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,860
Thanks for your hard work, Yuan Ying.

529
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,980
I also have a work plan.

530
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,260
It's about the dishes.

531
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,590
Any advice is welcomed.

532
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,490
Did you write this?

533
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,160
This is really a good job.

534
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,020
There are even pictures on it.

535
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,360
I thought only Yuan Ying could do this.

536
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,870
The handwriting is getting better.

537
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,410
Yes.

538
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,800
It's all because Ms. Yuan Ying teaches me well.

539
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,930
Show it to Yuan Ying.

540
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,980
Please have a look, Ms. Yuan Ying.

541
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,000
[Plan for Dishes]

542
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,730
It's very feasible.

543
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,960
If you have no objection,

544
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,640
then let's just do it.

545
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:22,980
Okay.

546
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,910
We have business to do now.

547
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,280
Have you seen Jing recently?

548
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,460
I haven't seen her for a long time.

549
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,320
No.

550
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,010
Where has she gone?

551
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,180
[Be honest and real]

552
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,660
We have to take away the chair.

553
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,940
Is everything ready?

554
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,010
What's wrong?

555
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,650
Nothing.

556
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,040
You pawned your weapons?

557
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,310
Yes.

558
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,560
I've given the money to the restaurant.

559
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,900
Let's go find a house to rent tomorrow.

560
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,930
A house to rent...

561
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,280
Rent...

562
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,730
We even have to find it ourselves?

563
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,340
Of course.

564
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,850
After we move out,

565
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,730
we have to find a place to stay.

566
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,100
Yes.

567
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,980
I've been a prince for too long,

568
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,360
and really have no idea about many things.

569
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,000
Don't worry.

570
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,060
I've asked around.

571
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,080
The houses in the north of the city

572
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,700
are cheap and quiet.

573
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,890
Let's go north.

574
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,610
North?

575
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,980
North?

576
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,980
Then we'll almost live near Mochuan, right?

577
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,180
So what?

578
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,710
There will be snow in winter.

579
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,650
Besides,

580
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,500
before we find a new way to make a living,

581
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,760
we should live a frugal life.

582
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,180
Look at you!

583
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,760
You're used to living a good life.

584
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,820
Of course you don't understand this.

585
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:34,930
Yes.

586
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,030
I don't understand it.

587
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,860
So I think

588
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,100
we may not be able to live through such a life.

589
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,330
How about we divorce?

590
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:31,540
♫The weather is cool, the clouds are light♫

591
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,760
♫Flowing waters greet people♫

592
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,800
♫In the breeze♫

593
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,590
♫Your gentle smile♫

594
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,970
♫It is remembered in my heart♫

595
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:54,750
♫The red cherry blossoms fall with the wind♫

596
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:01,110
♫Weapons run out, time passes♫

597
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,380
♫Everything goes with the wind♫

598
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,030
♫As I remember you♫

599
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,710
♫I will have a nice day♫

600
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:17,890
♫My life is related with you♫

601
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:23,480
♫The chance meeting made me fall in love at first sight♫

602
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,630
♫So many rains and winds♫

603
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,130
♫Wet the footprints♫

604
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:34,870
♫You're the reason I'm here♫

605
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:40,320
♫Mountains and rivers stretch for thousands of miles because of you♫

606
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,980
♫We enjoy at the grassy grass at the pavilion♫

607
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,650
♫My love♫

608
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,820
♫Won't change♫

609
00:45:52,520 --> 00:46:00,070
♫No matter the ends of the earth, I will wait for you♫

610
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,270
♫The red cherry blossoms fall with the wind♫

611
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:29,970
♫Weapons run out, time passes♫

612
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,530
♫Everything goes with the wind♫

613
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,370
♫As I remember you♫

614
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:42,050
♫I will have a nice day♫

615
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,930
♫I'll give you the rest of my life and we'll be together♫

616
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:52,810
♫We have fallen in love with each other as time goes♫

617
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,710
♫So many rains and winds♫
