through the selection.

12

not everyone is so lucky.

14
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
They didn't come here voluntarily.

15
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,590
So in private,

16

I also made a promise to Lord Danchuan.

If I have a say one day,

20
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,490
I will reform this unreasonable old system of peace-making marriage.

21

27
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,610
I hope

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,520
we can stop the selection through which

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,440
women are forced to marry into Xinchuan.

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,920
I suggest to let themget married freely,

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,220
with one husband only having one wife.

32
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,970
In this way,

33
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,540

I think the selection can continue,

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,070
but we don't select court ladies,

38
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,920
instead we select talents.

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,220
We gather talents from the nine regions.

40
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,820
Women can also be officials.

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,780
In this way,

42
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,730
we can maintain the harmony in the nine regions,

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,640

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,280
I didn't think it through.

194
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,970
But I couldn't think of a better way.

195
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
Now they're selecting female officials instead.

196
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,520
I shouldn't make the money.

197
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,240
Anyway,

198
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,730
you did something bad out of kindness.

199
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,180
But...

200
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,460
why didn't you explain to Her Ladyship just now?

201
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,120
I know Haitang best.

202
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,780
She's always patient.

203
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,210
But once she gets angry,

204
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,080
she won't listen to anything.

205
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,600
Forget it.

206
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,770
After all, that's who I am in her heart.

207
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,050
There's nothing to explain to her.

208
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,770
I think

209
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,870
Her Ladyship should no longer be angry now.

210
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,790
Go find her

211
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,010
and explain it to her.

212
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,180
Do you think she'll listen?

213
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,690
Please talk nicely.

214
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,990
I think she will.

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,530
You do it.

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
No, Prince.

217
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,560
Thank you.

218
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,600
Actually, Prince An’s not bad,

219
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,140
but he’s really stupid.

220
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,850
So-so.

221
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,420
It is just so-so.

222
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,960
Three points.

223
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,390
This one looks good,

224
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,220
but her eyebrows are tight and she looks fierce.

225
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,690
Five points.

226
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,900
Her face is so big.

227
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,160
This one looks good.

228
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,950
I can give her eight points for her looks.

229
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,400
What do you think, Zai?

230
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,430
What do you think?

231
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,310
Brother Yue, are you done?

232
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,130
How long do I have to sit here?

233
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,210
Can I have braised pork now?

234
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,280
Braised pork is greasy.

235
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,640
What's so good about it?

236
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,920
I don't know what these people are busy with lately.

237
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,120
They don't come to play with me anymore.

238
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,580
Stay with me for a while.

239
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:02,730
Here.

240
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,060
What do you think of her?

241
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,530
Is she worth eight points?

242
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,590
I think it's impolite

243
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,050
to give them points.

244
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,780
I don't want to play with you anymore.

245
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,060
No.

246
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:15,770
Zai.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,130
Not bad.

248
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,480
What are you doing?

249
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,210
Brother Han.

250
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,610
Where are you going?

251
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,870
I'm leaving Xinchuan.

252
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,620
Farewell.

253
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,860
I won't see you for the rest of my life.

254
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,080
Where are you going?

255
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
Do you still have to ask?

256
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,350
The selection date of the nine regions

257
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,150
is coming.

258
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,450
If you want to get married,

259
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,490
you do it yourself.

260
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,330
I don't want to.

261
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,010
I have to go.

262
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,260
Why don't you want to get married?

263
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,980
Besides,

264
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
I caught you.

265
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,520
How can I let you go?

266
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,980
If Father blames me,

267
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,330
can I still live?

268
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,830
Damn it.

269
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,560
Yue.

270
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,580
Take care of yourself.

271
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,940
Don't blame me.

272
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,120
Why?

273
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,610
Fine.

274
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,980
In this way,

275
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,810
you don’t have to hurt others.

276
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,990
Prince Han.

277
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,790
Actually,

278
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,400
I have to tell you

279
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,940
the selection of women in the nine regions

280
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,150
is cancelled.

281
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,820
But it's not completely cancelled.

282
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,560
Now it will select female officials.

283
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,500
-What? -What?

284
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,630
It's cancelled?

285
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,640
There's no such cruel nightmare

286
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,370
as an arranged marriage anymore.

287
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,680
There's no such good thing

288
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,540
as an arranged marriage anymore.

289
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,790
I made it.

290
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,540
I'm so lucky.

291
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,520
I'm not married yet.

292
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,970
Why am I always the one who gets hurt?

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,770
I want to get married.

294
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,380
There is no chance left for me.

295
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,840
[Danchuan Mochuan Jichuan]

296
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,290
[Zhang Zaoer, Jichuan]

297
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,700
Can't I not go?

298
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,630
I want to go home.

299
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,940
Finished reading?

300
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,320
The candidates for female officials from different regions

301
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,920
will enter the palace today.

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,760
Only one person is sent here from Jichuan this year.

303
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,510
Her father is in the...

304
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,360
The same position as my father.

305
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,870
Really?

306
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,640
It seems that this girl has the same fate as you.

307
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,880
All right.

308
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,370
Come in.

309
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,820
All right.

310
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,200
Nanny.

311
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,450
I brought these from my hometown.

312
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,170
Are you from Jichuan?

313
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,480
How did you know?

314
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,510
You're the same as the last one from Jichuan.

315
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,120
All right.

316
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,670
Take your bag.

317
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,390
Go in.

318
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,530
Thank you, Nanny.

319
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,180
Nanny.

320
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,540
I have a question.

321
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,470
Can I have a word with you?

322
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,980
Please check it.

323
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,710
Go ahead.

324
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,090
What can I do for you?

325
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,470
If I ran away today,

326
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,930
what would happen?

327
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
Nothing will happen.

328
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,600
Lady Wei.

329
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,560
Give her the bag.

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,650
Follow me.

331
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,740
Can I eat all of these?

332
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,550
Of course.

333
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,099
You're really nice.

334
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,810
Use another pair of chopsticks to pick up food.

335
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,250
Sit down and eat.

336
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,120
You didn't have enough lunch, right?

337
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,850
No, I didn't.

338
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,500
There are so many rules.

339
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:57,910
Besides,

340
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,280
if I didn't fail the selection,

341
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,760
it would be worse.

342
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,210
You want to fail the selection?

343
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,310
Who would come all the way here

344
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,010
to marry someone she doesn't even know?

345
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,390
So what if he is the Prince of Xinchuan?

346
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,370
You thought you came here

347
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,300
for the marriage selection?

348
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,420
Of course.

349
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,500
I ran out like this,

350
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,030
will they come to arrest me?

351
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,440
My father is just a small official in Jichuan.

352
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,520
I really don't want to hurt my family.

353
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,230
No.

354
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,500
Don't worry.

355
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,570
I'll protect you.

356
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,880
Really?

357
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,620
I can tell from your clothes that

358
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,400
you must be very important in the palace.

359
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,880
That nanny just now

360
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,550
was also respectful to you.

361
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,410
Well,

362
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,090
I'll let go of the formalities.

363
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,670
Where are you from in Jichuan?

364
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm from Yunxi Town, Langyue County.

365
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,250
My name is Zhang Zaoer.

366
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,170
Langyue County.

367
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,810
You know Langyue County?

368
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,810
You're also from Jichuan?

369
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,110
My father told me

370
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,190
the last girl from Jichuan

371
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,990
is now the wife of the Crown Prince.

372
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,250
She’s really a legend.

373
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,790
Other nannies called you Lady of the Sixth Prince.

374
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,940
Is it you?

375
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,030
It's really you.

376
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,990
Your legend is spreading all over Jichuan.

377
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,850
I really didn't expect to see you.

378
00:19:59,330 --> 00:19:59,730
You...

379
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,200
Can you take me away?

380
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,400
You'd better eat first.

381
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,210

00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,860
What else can I say?

572
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,570
Lady.

573
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,220
We lied to the Prince.

574
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,580
Will he really be angry?

575
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,280
No.

576
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,240
Why will he really be angry?

577
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,280
You're right.

578
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,400
Prince has such a good temper.

579
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,860
He treats you even better.

580
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,200
Prince.

581
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,500
Prince.

582
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,830
It's time.

583
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,560
It's time for you to attend the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet at the Palace of Peace.

584
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:16,880
OK.

585
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,990
[Contract of Sale]

586
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,140
After such a long trip,

587
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,730
we finally signed the branch.

588
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,600
I wonder how much dividends we can get next year.

589
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,040
What's wrong?

590
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,470
Lady.

591
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,460
The axle is broken.

592
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,520
We can't leave now.

593
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,200
It'll be too late if we don't hurry back now.

594
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,300
What took you so long?

595
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,100
Father.

596
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:08,920
Mother.

597
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,750
Zheng is here.

598
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,850
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

599
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,840
You're late.

600
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,150
Why are you so busy during the festival?

601
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,880
I was delayed by some business.

602
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,620
Where is Li Wei?

603
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,130
She was finishing her work in the restaurant just now.

604
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,260
She'll be here soon.

605
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,410
Just now, Qi...

606
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,010
All right.

607
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,960
Well...

608
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,340
Almost all are here.

609
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,820
Have a seat.

610
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,370
Here, Brother An.

611
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,910
Why don't we stop waiting?

612
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,330
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

613
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,040
Let's start the banquet first.

614
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,410
OK.

615
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,460
Let's start.

616
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,130
Here.

617
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,140
Let's eat.

618
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,210
OK.

619
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,750
Here.

620
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,450
Here, have some of this.

621
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,580
Here, big meatball.

622
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,630
Get me some beef.

623
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,760
It looks delicious.

624
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:04,940
Eat more.

625
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,600
Well...

626
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,760
The banquet has started.

627
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,560
Why isn't Her Ladyship here yet?

628
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,380
Did something happen?

629
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,730
It's a good day. Don't jinx it.

630
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,880
Listen.

631
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,490
Lady.

632
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,270
Have you prepared what we need for longevity noodles?

633
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,900
Yes.

634
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,860
OK, let's get to work.

635
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,450
Let's go.

636
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,740
Wait.

637
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:37,950
It's too high.

638
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,810
I can't get off.

639
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,250
Lady, take care.

640
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,900
Hurry up.

641
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,020
Eat more.

642
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,880
OK.

643
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:53,850
Here.

644
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,370
I'll get you another one.

645
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,490
What do you want to eat?

646
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,260
Chicken wings.

647
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,660
A piece of chicken wings.

648
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,660
This is good.

649
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,990
I'm sure you'll like it.

650
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,510
I'm going to Daichuan after Mid-Autumn Festival.

651
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,600
Daichuan is a good place.

652
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,840
Take me with you.

653
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,920
It depends on your performance.

654
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,750
What do you mean?

655
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,750
It's all from the bottom of my heart.

656
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,250
I heard that your rouge stall

657
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,650
is famous in the capital.

658
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,850
If you need money,

659
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,850
just let me know.

660
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,040
I won't take anyone's money.

661
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,330
I just want to see

662
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:28,889
how far I can go on myself.

663
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,560
Before, I only wanted to rely on others.

664
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,489
From now on, only I deserve to be my own boss.

665
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,420
If you want,

666
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,880
you can go anywhere.

667
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,530
You too, female official.

668
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,020
Here.

669
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:44,659
Today,

670
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,520
we don't have to make a toast, right?

671
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,600
No.

672
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,659
Everyone knows us.

673
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,090
Just eat quietly.

674
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:55,810
OK.

675
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,290
Haitang.

676
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,590
After staying up late and training these days,

677
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,680
I won't be wrong next time.

678
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,620
I'll tell the 16 of them apart

679
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,620
clearly.

680
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,070
Don't talk big.

681
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,240
You said the same thing

682
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,790
last time and the time before last time.

683
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,520
This time is really different.

684
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,860
Yao Man has

685
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,880
big double-fold eyelids and high-bridged nose.

686
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,480
Dai Chu has

687
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,830
an oval face and round eyes.

688
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,990
She also has one high eyebrow and one low eyebrow.

689
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,160
That's because she didn't do her makeup well.

690
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,530
You have one high eyebrow and one low eyebrow.

691
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,230
It's me.

692
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,760
It's bustling with activity today.

693
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,530
Why didn't Han and Yue come?

694
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,690
During the Mid-Autumn Festival,

695
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,560
it's busy at the Nine Regions Food Collection.

696
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,550
Han went to help.

697
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:32,690
Yue

698
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,880
heard that no one in Xinchuan

699
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,760
wants to go on a date with him.

700
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,190
So he went to other regions to try again.

701
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,200
Among my children,

702
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,640
everyone is troublesome.

703
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,250
I'm not troublesome.

704
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,870
You?

705
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,330
Why isn't Li Wei here yet?

706
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,730
I can't pretend anymore.

707
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,890
Hang in there.

708
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,480
It should be OK soon.

709
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,520
Don't waste your effort.

710
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,210
Eat.

711
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,470
OK.

712
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,920
She's here.

713
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,650
She's so beautiful today.

714
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,760
She's finally here.

715
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,440
[Happy Birthday to Yin Zheng]

716
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,950
As usual,

717
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,080
you have to unveil it yourself.

718
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,070
OK.

719
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:55,120
Good.

720
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,930
It almost killed me.

721
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,760
I thought you forgot.

722
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,840
I'm joking with you.

723
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,900
How could I forget?

724
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:01,800
Zheng,

725
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,000
your birthday is the same day as Mid-Autumn Festival.

726
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,330
Everyone remembers it.

727
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,530
Really?

728
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,680
Really.

729
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,570
Your wife asked us to keep it from you.

730
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,170
Don’t be angry.

731
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,080
Yes.

732
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,480
Li Wei has prepared for a long time

733
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,570
to surprise you.

734
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,580
We'll celebrate your birthday together

735
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,150
every year from now on.

736
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:20,570
OK.

737
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,550
Yes.

738
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,900
-Together. -Together.

739
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,850
Come on, everyone.

740
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,860
Li Wei is here.

741
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,920
Let’s fill the wine.

742
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,320
I brought this wine from Jinchuan

743
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,850
to liven things up.

744
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,840
I know this wine.

745
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,130
You may not buy it even if you have money.

746
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:35,460
Here.

747
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
Let's enjoy ourselves to the full today.

748
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,770
OK?

749
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,000
Let's have this toast

750
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,420
to wish Zheng

751
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,890
a happy birthday and good fortune.

752
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,660
Good.

753
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,700
Happy birthday and good fortune.

754
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,820
Thank you.

755
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,220
Eat.

756
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,010
Why aren't you drinking?

757
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,680
I may not be able to drink anymore.

758
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,220
Why?

759
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,980
The imperial physician has come.

760
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,900
He said

761
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,410
you're going to be a father.

762
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,320
Really?

763
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,840
I only told you.

764
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,370
I'll tell everyone when the baby is stable.

765
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:18,740
OK.

766
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I'll make a toast.

767
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,560
We gather here today.

768
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,500
Let's raise our glasses

769
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,140
to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.

770
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,810
OK.

771
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,730
Here.

772
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,280
Let's celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.

773
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,960
It is very sweet.

774
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,980
Brother An.

775
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,080
The moon cake is sweet.

776
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,700
I have to take some back

777
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,030
for my solar term girls.

778
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,000
What are you talking about?

779
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,490
I'll kick you out if you keep talking nonsense.

780
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:00,960
No.

781
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,330
Not mine.

782
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,380
Delicious.

783
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:07,810
Try it.

784
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:12,320
So sweet.

785
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,710
Sweet is the essence of life.

786
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,330
The old Yuan Ying

787
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,430
would say this is not in moderation.

788
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,740
Look at her now.

789
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,500
Right.

790
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,520
It's good to be like this now.

791
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:27,880
Here.

792
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,010
Actually,

793
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,050
I don't like sweet food now.

794
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,320
I just want to eat something spicy.

795
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,940
Come on.

796
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,180
Brother Qi.

797
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,820
What's your plan after the festival?

798
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,210
I've told Father.

799
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,280
We'll set off after the festival.

800
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,530
We'll go to Daichuan first,

801
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,600
and then

802
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,460
we'll see if there are places we haven't been to.

803
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:48,990
We'll try

804
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,150
to travel around the nine regions as soon as possible.

805
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,280
Prince Qi’s plan is very clear.

806
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,830
Just listen to him brag.

807
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,120
He gets lost as soon as he goes out.

808
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,630
Traveling around the nine regions?

809
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,800
It's good that you can distinguish the nine regions.

810
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
He's a lost cause.

811
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,270
What about Brother An?

812
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,890
Ask Haitang.

813
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,490
I'll do whatever she wants.

814
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,210
That's more like it.

815
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,750
I wonder where you all are

816
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,650
at this time next year.

817
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,680
Can we get together like today?

818
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,280
How about this?

819
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,070
We promise,

820
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,280
every Mid-Autumn Festival from now on,

821
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,300
no matter where we are

822
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,390
or what we are doing,

823
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,520
we gather together to enjoy the full moon.

824
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,020
OK?

825
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,600
OK.

826
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,040
What a beautiful moon.

827
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,260
Next year will be better than this year.

828
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,420
What about the year after?

829
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,960
The year after next year will be even better.

830
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,940
What about the year after that?

831
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,220
Even even better.

832
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,330
What about the year after that?

833
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,900
Even even even better.

834
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,380
What about the year after that?

835
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,600
♫The wind talks softly to me♫

836
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,420
Even even even even better.

837
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,090
♫Listen how the time sings lightly♫

838
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:17,900
♫Fireworks are in full bloom, scattering the sky with the past♫

839
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,920
♫The stars are climbing up my heart♫

840
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,760
So beautiful.

841
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,310
♫The eyes of the night shine with moonlight♫

842
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:31,380
♫Remembering your face at this time♫

843

855
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:58,150
♫Autumn leaves fall, waiting for you and me to write a new chapter♫

856
