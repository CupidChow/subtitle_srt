00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,410
A granted marriage?

5
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,490
I knew

6
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,380
you'd have a bright future, Lady of Prince Zheng's.

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,050
Lady of Prince Zheng's?

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,880
Prince Zheng's concubine?

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,900
That's right, Prince Zheng.

10
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,539
What?

11
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,280
Get into the palanquin so you don't miss the time.

12
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,240
Nanny.

13
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,320
I think you're mistaken.

14
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,190
I'm not.

15
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,100
I was surprised too.

16
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,500
How come you didn't lose?

17
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,680

23
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,380
Greetings to Your Ladyship.

24
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,860
Me?

25
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,050
Get up.

26
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,520
Yes, Your Ladyship.

27
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,790
I'd like to ask

28
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,720
why I was assigned to Prince Zheng?

29
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,390
Does Lord Xinchuan not like this son?

30
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,320
I heard Zheng asked for you.

31
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,360
The selection is over.

32
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,579
How will the women in each region be assigned?

33
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,780
I already have a plan.

34
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,070
But there is one left.

35
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,730
Will you two help me with my worries?

36
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,340
Father.

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm young and there is no hurry to have a family.

38
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
That's right.

39
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,340
My brother is still young.

40
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,140
But I'm older.

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,200
I can have several wives at the same time.

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,660
Father.

43
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,340
Good.

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,030
Then how about giving you Li Wei from Jichuan?

45
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,380
The one from Jichuan?

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,010
I mean...

47
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,760
She...

48
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,160
Forget about it.

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,700
She's not at all decent.

50
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,110
My Lord, you know

51
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,910
they all deserve much better

52
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,440
than the girl from Jichuan.

53
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,480
How about I give her to...

54
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,930
Prince Zheng is here.

55
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,100
My Lord.

56
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,550
There is only one girl from Jichuan in this election.

57
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,160
If she is not chosen, I'm afraid the balance will break.

58
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm almost 20 years old,

59
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,630
at the right age to marry.

60
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,530
Can you marry Miss Li from Jichuan to me?

61
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,530
In that case,

62
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,610
I'll let you have Li Wei.

63
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,400
But don't worry.

64
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,710
She will only be your concubine.

65
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,390
I will choose another good marriage for you later.

66
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,840
Your Highness.

It's time for Nymphoides Soup again.

00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,220
Come on.

69
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,850
Why did you pour it out again?

70
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,380
It can warm your stomach.

71
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,760
I've been drinking this for years.

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,020
It doesn't help at all.

73
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,020
It's all about persistence.

74
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,630
It's better to have it than to give up.

75
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,890
Come on, Your Highness, take it.

76
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,890
Be a good boy.

77
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,770
It's heartbreaking.

78
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,490
You're so sick.

79
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,450
And you still managed to ask for the marriage.

80
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,050
The marriage would be mine whether I did or not.

81
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,270
I'd rather give in to their wishes myself.

82
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,070
The Lord has never cared for you.

83
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,100
I feel bad when I think of this.

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,740
If the Lord

85
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,520
forgets to grant you a decent wife,

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
it can be a great loss.

87
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,409
What can the concubine from Jichuan do for you?

88
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,310
Forget it.

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,780
I've never thought of using my wife's family

90
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,260
after all.

91
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,159
What a righteous man you are, Your Highness.

92
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,620
You have such a good heart.

93
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,390
And you are so resourceful.

94
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,000
You've acted as if you were trying to relieve the Lord's worries

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,920
when you were seriously ill.

96
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,180
You've earned all the sympathy points.

97
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,420
Go and get a doctor.

98
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,920
Otherwise, I'd really die.

99
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,430
Go now.

100
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,070
I'm on my way.

101
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,820
Your Ladyship.

102
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,440
Although it's rumored that Prince Zheng is unfavorable,

103
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,950
I've made inquiries.

104
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,950
They don't scold the servants in the mansion.

105
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,170
It's a good place to go.

106
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,770
Don't worry, Your Ladyship.

107
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,870
No scolding of the servants

108
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,210
makes it a good place to go?

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,740
I know you are well-informed.

110
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,620
But you should keep your mouth shut.

111
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,490
Doctor Zhang, this way, please.

112
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,880
The prince can't hold it anymore.

113
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,400
You guys, be quick about it.

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,640
Quickly, send it in.

115
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,460
Don't follow.

116
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,750
Is the water hot enough?

117
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,280
Hurry up.

118
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,360

119
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,100
Your Highness.

120

Su.

121
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,000
How is he?

122
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,020
What did the doctor say?

123
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,600
The doctor said it's worse than expected.

124
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,270
What a tragic fate he has!

125
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,040
He's been sick and weak since he was a child.

126
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,340
Now he's getting worse.

127
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,270
What should we do?

128
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,560
He only has half a month to live.

129
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,460
I mean.

130
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,820
Why would he run around?

131
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,680
Only half a month to live?

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,080
I'll go check it out.

133
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,720
Right, go ahead.

134
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,530
Be quick about it.

135
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,570
Come on.

136
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
Do you know

137
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,810
that the Prince Zheng is dying

138
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,430
and has only half a month left?

139
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,470
Don't talk nonsense, Your Ladyship.

140
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,230
That's right.

141
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,850
You'd get executed

142
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,210
if it's heard.

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,880
In the palace, the health condition of the Lord and princes

144
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,600
is absolutely forbidden to talk about.

145
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,400
That's right.

146
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,640
Although everyone knows that Prince Zheng has stomach problems,

147
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,260
no one is allowed to talk about it

148
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,800
except for those who serve him personally.

149
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
Your Ladyship, don't ever say

150
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,270
such horrible things again.

151
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,070
That's right.

152
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,920
I see.

153
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,810
No wonder no one else wanted me

154
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,170
but him.

155
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,190
So it's for repelling misfortune.

156
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,050
-Your Ladyship! -Your Ladyship.

157
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,080
Okay, I get it.

158
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,600
This must not be told.

159
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,310
You may leave now.

160
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,490
Yes.

161
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,740
How can it be so serious this time?

162
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,760
Come on.

163
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,150

165
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,550
This way, please.

166
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,680
I think there's only half a month left before the Exam.

167
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,830
You don't have to take it.

168
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,630
Father will judge this Exam.

169
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,300
I can't miss it.

170
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
Don't worry, I won't die.

171
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,040
You won't?

172
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
Look how sick you are.

173
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,920
Your wedding has been made simple by decree.

174
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,580
The bride only had to pay her respect in the ancestral shrine.

175
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,040
Do you think you can still…

176
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,730
You can't even perform sexually, can you?

177
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,730
I need to rest now.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,600
All right.

179
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:39,970
Go to sleep.

180
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,600
-It's okay. I'll stay with you. -Bye

181
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560
I'll stay with you. It's okay.

182
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,690

186
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,840
I'm going to return home

My husband is dying.

190
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,240
When the flowers bloom,

191
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,840
I can soon return.

192
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,150
Remember to get the food and wine ready.

193
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,080
Beef on the fire is indispensable.

194
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,260
It's a pity you'll die young.

195
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,570
God bless.

196
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,240
Let him live long and prosperous

197
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,780
in the next life.

198
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,180
In the days to come,

199
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,910
I'll take good care of him

200
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,890
and be there for the rest of his life.

201
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,980
What does Yin Zheng look like?

202
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,360
I haven't seen him yet.

203
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,890
Why does it smell like medicine?

204
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,150
Li Wei from Jichuan

205
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,900
is here to pay my respects.

206
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,410
Why is there so much blood?

207
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,930
He's not dead, is he?

208
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,510
Your Highness.

209
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,460
Your Highness.

210
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,550
Your Highness.

211
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,430
Stop it.

212
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,330
So he's Zheng?

213
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,730
Oh my god.

214
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,600
Why are you so nervous?

215
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
This isn't the first time we've met.

216
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,560
Since you're in charge of prelibation in this mansion,

217
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,290
why don't you taste the wild mushroom soup for me?

218
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,460
What?

219
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,560
I know I'm wrong.

220
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,280
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

221
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,520
That's fine, My Lady.

222
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,880
I'm just bluffing.

223
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,670
Get up.

224
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,990
We haven't known each other long enough.

225
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,390
What's your family like?

226
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,130
My family has been farming for three generations.

227
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,800
My father was the only one who passed the exam.

228
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,480
But he's too minor to get into Jichuan Palace.

229
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,210
Tell me something I don't know.

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,460
Something you don't know…

231
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,980
My father is very good at cooking and loves my mother.

232
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,640
I have a brother named Li Cang.

233
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,500
He always fights with me.

234
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,870
Can you read and write?

235
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,430
Etiquette and rules,

236
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,590
the Four Books and Six Arts,

237
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,970
sewing and maid's work, I'm not so familiar with all of them.

238
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,490
I'm quite good at

239
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,030
food tasting though.

240
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,960
I can read a menu.

241
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,140
So you like to eat.

242
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,300
But my brother just fools along every day.

243
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
When I tell him what to do, he…

244
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,070
Do you have anything

245
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,820
you don't like?

246
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,790
Transcription.

247
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,090
My mother always punished me for transcription

248
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,500
when I did something wrong.

249
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,320
I can't write well.

250
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,200
Stealing food from the kitchen is not a big mistake.

251
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,760
But it's a rule.

252
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,420
You still have to be punished.

253
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,680
What should I be punished for?

254
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,610
Transcription.

255
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,100
You'll have to copy the menu of this mansion

256
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,860
for one hundred times.

257
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,500
I see.

258
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,640
It was the same when my grandfather died.

259
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,170
He was vomiting blood.

260
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,540
But he chose to hide it from us.

261
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,140
I didn't want us to worry about him.

262
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,400
Such a poor, kind person.

263
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,180
Why are you looking at me like that?

264
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,350
Your Highness,

265
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,420
Don't worry.

266
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,100
I will treat you well

267
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,810
for the rest of your life.

268
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,120
[Prince Qi's Mansion]

269
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,480
On this wedding night,

270
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,020
the other palaces are also

271
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,570
quiet and peaceful.

272
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,350
Help!

273
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,140
I'm getting killed!

274
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,940
Help!

275
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,520
Murder!

276
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,360
Your Highness.

277
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
Princess Danchuan wants to see you now.

278
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,660
I can't help with it.

279
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,010
She can see me anytime she wants?

280
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,040
I don't want to see her.

281
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,200
Lord Xinchuan has orders.

282
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,560
You must sacrifice yourself

283
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,000
for the sake of peace between the two regions.

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,640
I won't sacrifice myself!

285
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,840
Help!

286
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,180
[Keep loyal for justice]

287
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,090
Let me down!

288
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,370
What are you doing?

289
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,210
Untie me!

290
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,940
You!

291
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,000
Let go of me!

292
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,370
What are you doing?

293
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,500
Shangguan Qian, I'm warning you.

294
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,440
My father wouldn't let me marry my beloved.

295
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,200
I had no other choice but to marry you.

296
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,430
We both carry the alliance of the two regions.

297
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,840
And I'm the Prince of Xinchuan.

298
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,980
You can't use force against me.

299
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,780
Do you hear me?

300
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,370
Murder!

301
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,160
My name is Shangguan Jing.

302
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,040
Does it pronounce as Jing?

303
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,260
Forget it.

304
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,740
From today onwards,

305
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,410
you'll be my wife.

306
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,630
A wife should listen to her husband.

307
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,310
From now on,

308
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,700
you should treat me with respect.

309
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,850
What are you going to do?

310
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,330
If you're going to be my husband,

311
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,740
you must raise my spear.

312
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,140
If not,

313
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,400
we'll both have to call it quits.

314
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,520
You must have done something to it.

315
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,410
I won't fall for it.

316
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,010
All right.

317
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,720
We can compete on something else.

318
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,240
Good.

319
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,660
Like I'd be afraid of you.

320
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,090
We'll start when I say so.

321
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,770
Start.

322
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,690
I can hang in there.

323
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,020
See? I'm okay.

324
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,610
I'm okay.

325
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,470
I'm okay.

326
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,120
See?

327
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,070
You

328
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,730
are

329
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,380
not okay.

330
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,460
Meanwhile,

331
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,760
in the cozy mansion of the first eldest prince.

332
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,310
[Prince Song's Mansion, Jie Yuan]

333
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
Hao from Yanchuan

334
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
presents tea to you, Your Ladyship.

335
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,750
Now that you're married to our family,

336
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,050
you are a member of it.

337
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,790
From now on,

338
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,500
you can treat this as your own home.

339
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,330
Thank you for your kindness, Your Ladyship.

340
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,280
It's not filled at all.

341
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,550
I heard that you were promised to Yin Qi at first.

342
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,569
Then our prince

343
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,160
personally asked for you.

344
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,410
Good for you.

345
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,170
I dare not.

346
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,670
Don't you try to

347
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,010
play any tricks in front of me.

348
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,340
Understand?

349
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,170
Yes.

350
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,380
Get up.

351
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,000
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

352
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,600
Your Highness.

353
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,920
What happened to your hand?

354
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,930
Nothing.

355
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,830
She's not even good at offering tea.

356
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,000
It spilled over and burned her hand.

357
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,720
It's okay.

358
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,110
Your Highness, have some tea.

359
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,720
The tea has a good color

360
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,910
and pure aroma.

361
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,260
Could it be from Daichuan?

362
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,580
I've heard that the tea of Daichuan is world famous.

363
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,180
I've never tasted it before.

364
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,750
If you like it,

365
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,080
you can have it.

366
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

367
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,270
Like you can drink my tea!

368

Your Ladyship.

369
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,880
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,330
I don't know how I disobeyed you.

371
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,020
I've just never tasted Daichuan's tea before.

372
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,410
Your Ladyship, don't be angry,

373
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,610
in case you hurt your body because of me.

374
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,410
Hao Jia, get up.

375
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,640
Zhao Fangru.

376
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,800
This is not in Daichuan.

377
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,840
You'd better do something with your temper.

378
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,400
I've told you before.

379
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,760
I hate internal strife.

380
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,500
Fangru does have a bad temper.

381
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,420
But she's straightforward.

382
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,340
She says what she has to say

383
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
and won't hide it.

384
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,640
I know.

385
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,300
No woman is happy to see

386
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,680
her husband marrying someone new.

387
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,370
It's not easy for her.

388
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,380
I knew you were understanding.

389
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,450
Glad I went through all the trouble

390
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,360
to get you back from my brother.

391
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,290
But you can only be my concubine

392
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,690
if you're with me,

393
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,220
are you upset?

394
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,710
No, I'm not.

395
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,410
I know who I like.

396
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,580
Of course, I like myself.

397
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,890
Think about it.

398
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,440
Who is willing to be a concubine?

399
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,810
Do you think it's true love?

400
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,080
[Inner court study hall]

401
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,200
Ladies, I've met all of you before.

402
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,710
The Ministry of Internal Affairs sent me and several other nannies as instructors.

403
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,720
You can call me Nanny Yang.

404
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,470
Good day, Nanny Yang.

405
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,790
Have a seat.

406
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,260
In the inner court study hall,

407
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,470
me and the Ministry of Internal Affairs
will

408
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,790
evaluate you according to

409
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,210
your virtue, appearance, speech and merit.

410
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,340
If you don't do well,

411
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,010
not only will you be punished,

412
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,210
but your husband shall be involved too.

413
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,100
I thought you don't like classes.

414
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,630
No, I don't.

415
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,380
But Yin Zheng is already in such poor health.

416
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,040
I can't cause him any trouble.

417
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:38,860
So…

418
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,810
I ask you to behave yourselves

419
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,650
and be diligent in your studies.

420
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,050
Open the book, everyone.

421
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,880
Li Wei.

422
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,230
You've got the wrong book.

423
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,030
Today we're studying “The Rivers and Mountains”.

424
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,030
The world is divided into nine regions.

425
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,790
Seventy years ago, the regions were at war.

426
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,160
Lord Yuanfeng of Xinchuan appeared

427
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,590
and took over the world.

428
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,430
Since then, a 100-year peace alliance has been established between the nine regions.

429
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,760
Xinchuan has the largest area and population

430
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,430
among the nine regions.

431
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,660
It's vast

432
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,990
and prosperous

433
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,120
with a long cultural heritage.

434
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,490
School's out.

435
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,900
Li Wei from Jichuan.

436
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,300
You're nodding off in class and not thinking ahead.

437
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,880
After class, I'll report you to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

438
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,480
50 cents of your monthly salary will be docked.

439
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,820
How did you do in the inner court study hall today?

440
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,830
I'm sorry.

441
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,830
You got money docked?

442
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,090
All right.

443
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,590
I didn't expect you to do so well.

444
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,660
Let's eat.

445
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,460
You have to wait for the prince to start first

446
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,320
when eating with him.

447
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,680
You'll have to wait

448
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,940
before he starts.

449
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,010
Understand?

450
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,940
Recently the prince is not feeling well.

451
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,870
Tell Liu Baoquan

452
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,620
not to serve these oily meat dishes

453
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,580
these days.

454
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,860
You must wait until the prince

455
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,360
picks up the dishes

456
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,270
on the table.

457
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,070
You're not supposed to pick up the dishes more than three times.

458
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,670
I'm full.

459
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,000
Enjoy your meal.

460
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,320
Our prince doesn't care about the rules.

461
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,250
Feel free to eat.

462
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,220
You're done?

463
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,340
The medicine won't taste good if it's cold.

464
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,120
I don't think it tastes good even if it's hot.

465
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,150
You don't have many days left.

466
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,840
But you're still working so hard.

467
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,780
It's because I don't have many days left,

468
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,180
so I have to study harder.

469
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,150
What a diligent man!

470
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,890
Don't worry, Your Highness.

471
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,950
After you're gone,

472
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,870
I'll burn some books for you from time to time.

473
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,160
You don't have to bring me books.

474
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,360
I've memorized it.

475
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,860
Memorize it and take it with you.

476
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,060
You're so knowledgeable.

477
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,920
I'm impressed.

478
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,130
I've finished the transcription of

479
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,720
the menu a hundred times.

480
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,030
There are a lot of dishes on the menu.

481
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,280
But you're not in a good condition

482
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,340
and can't eat them.

483
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,070
But don't be discouraged.

484
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,010
Even if you don't have many days left,

485
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,280
you must make each meal

486
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,990
and each hour count.

487
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,760
We're not really a couple now.

488
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,470
I can't live here

489
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,910
without good cause.

490
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,540
How about this?

491
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,850
Tell me your wish.

492
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,990
I'll help you achieve it.

493
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,790
You can't make my wish come true.

494
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,680
Go back.

495
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,020
I have to read the book.

496
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,850
Name one.

497
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,030
I want you to leave.

498
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,350
I'll just go ask someone else.

499
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,250
Father, Mother.

500
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,580
My husband's death is approaching.

501
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,710
I can soon come back.

502
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,700
When making lotus root starch,

503
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,650
remember to add some acacia flowers.

504
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,380
Wait for me to share it with you.

505
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,980
Please send the letter for me.

506
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,380
Yes.

507
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,110
Your Ladyship.

508
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,570
The prince is not well enough to come to your room right now.

509
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,080
But you must find a way

510
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,120
to bond with the prince these days.

511
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,380
What if

512
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,610
he forgets about you?

513
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,980
Don't say that.

514
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,430
If he still thinks about me

515
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,660
in that world,

516
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,450
it'll be a ghost story.

517
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,670
I can only grant him

518
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,520
some small wishes now.

519
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,460
Your Highness.

520
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,650
[Wenxin Hall]

521
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,810
Your Ladyship has been acting strange lately.

522
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,980
She always asks around about your preferences.

523
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,760
It's fine for her to ask the Ninth Prince

524
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,530
She even went to the Eleventh Prince.

525
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,550
If she has other plans,

526
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,880
we should be wary of her.

527
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,490
She has the simplest mind among the girls elected.

528
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,970
What plan can she have?

529
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,840
But Mother doesn't really want

530
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,770
my brother to get involved with me.

531
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,330
I should remind her of that.

532
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,540
But you're blood-related.

533
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,140
Perhaps Your Ladyship wants you to be close.

534
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,880
As a country girl from Jichuan,

535
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,900
it's not easy for Your Ladyship to be alone in the palace.

536
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,570
I think

537
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,670
she arranged these flowers

538
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,490
to please you.

539
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,070
Are you sure she's trying to please me?

540
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,170
Your Ladyship is weird though.

541
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,720
The prince is back?

542
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,840
Your Ladyship.

543
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,890
Do you like the flowers?

544
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,990
Since no one knows

545
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,350
what you like,

546
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,800
I just arranged some ordinary flowers.

547
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,520
But chrysanthemums are independent and aloof.

548
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,330
They are interesting too.

549
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,530
It's a good match for your temperament.

550
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,870
That's true.

551
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,100
Li Wei.

552
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,710
Did I offend you in any way?

553
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,810
Or do you think

554
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,490
you deserve someone better than me?

555
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,760
I just want to make you happy.

556
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,880
But you don't seem so happy.

557
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,200
What about this?

558
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,720
Do you like this one?

559
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,720
You're a wise and resourceful man.

560
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,780
I want to keep you in everyone's mind.

561
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,760
This is a good drawing.

562
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,550
Can I have one, Your Ladyship?

563
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,340
No problem.

564
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,410
It's a good painting though.

565
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,280
That's right.

566
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,760
When Your Ladyship gives it to me,

567
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,130
can I hang it in my room?

568
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,950
Look where she's hanging it.

569
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,320
From now on, when people see this painting,

570
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,720
they'll be reminded of your voice and face.

571
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,900
Voice and face?

572
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,040
What kind of wording is that?

573
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,960
I don't think you like it either.

574
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,450
It's okay.

575
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,840
I have another gift.

576
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,990
-No, no, no. -Don't.

577
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,580
I see you have a good heart.

578
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,510
But you don't have to give me gifts.

579
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,620
God, help me!

580
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,150
Yuping.

581
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:30,810
Ugh…

582
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,740
I haven't seen the prince so happy for a long time.

583
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,010
I found out from his brother

584
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,330
that His Highness used to have a dog.

585
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,710
There's something else the Eleventh Prince doesn't know.

586
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,630
The eldest prince was allergic to dog hair

587
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,120
and sent away the dog.

588
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,750
The prince knelt in front of the palace and begged for a day.

589
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,890
But he didn't even get to see the Lord.

590
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,220
Whenever I think of this…

591
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,830
Your Highness, give him a name.

592
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:24,740
Don't worry.

593
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,200
He will not be sent away.

594
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,490
I'm very strong.

595
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,470
I can protect it.

596
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,580
You don't have to be so serious about

597
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
what Su Shen said.

598
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,660
What should we call it?

599
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,430
Let's call it

600
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,480
Baifu.

601
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,690
Li Baifu.

602
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,550
What a corny name!

603
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,180
And why does it take my last name?

604
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,630
You brought it home.

605
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,150
I won't argue with you.

606
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,960
Li Baifu.

607
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,500
Li Baifu.

608
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,100
Your Highness,

609
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,980
both yellow chrysanthemum and lily

610
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,070
signify stable and long-lasting love.

611
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,300
I hope you can understand Your Ladyship's feelings.

612
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,650
She went all the way to the Ministry of Internal Affairs

613
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,030
and asked for Baifu

614
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,350
to please you.

615
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,310
Although she doesn't say it,

616
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,170
she likes you very much.

617
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,980
Shangguan Jing is inhumane.

618
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,960
Your Ladyship Chuan summoned me several times,

619
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,420
asking me to be nice to her.

620
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,900
But when I went over there,

621
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,920
she broke one of my arms.

622
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,860
If I go near her again, I'm sure I'll die.

623
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,970
What are all these?

624
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,760
It's creepy.

625
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,160
It looks like my funeral.

626
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,650
What's wrong with you?

627
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,910
Li Wei is very concerned about me lately.

628
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,770
She's been urging me to take my medication

629
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,900
and giving me gifts.

630
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,470
What do you think

631
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,670
does she mean by that?

632
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,710
I can't believe this.

633
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,880
If you want to show off how well your wife treats you

634
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,680
and how much she likes you,

635
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,680
you don't have to do it in front me of.

636
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,150
Like I haven't had enough?

637
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,420
I'm out of here.

638
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,160
She likes me?

639
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,590
Hao Jia.

640
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,310
I heard from Yuzhan

641
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,580
that the Prince Song's wife doesn't treat you well.

642
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,470
She always asks me to kneel.

643
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,900
I was also made to kneel down

644
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,730
when I was at home.

645
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,500
It's okay.

646
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,980
Besides, Yin Song is my master.

647
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,530
Life will always get better

648
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,660
if he treats me well.

649
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,840
And you?

650
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
How are you doing?

651
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,610
I'm okay.

652
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,190
I just want to be nice to him,

653
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,390
so I can send him away with dignity.

654
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,370
Send him away?

655
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,440
Where to?

656
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,010
It's okay.

657
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,440
You'll know after 10 days.

658
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,820
I'll be able to go home then.

659
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,800
Can you go home?

660
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,860
Yes, definitely.

661
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,240
I wonder if my father and mother

662
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,700
have received my letters,

663
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,340
Yin Zheng allows you to send letters home?

664
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,590
It's a rule in Xinchuan

665
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,590
that concubines are not allowed to send letters home.

666
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,810
There are such rules?

667
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,320
I didn't even know that.

668
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,050
I guess Yin Zheng is really a good guy.

669
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,250
Take a look.

670
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,390
Your Highness.

671
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,290
Take a look.

672
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,580
These are Your Ladyship's letters.

673
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,220
Didn't you tell her that it can't be sent out?

674
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,330
Send it out?

675
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,420
What's written in the letters

676
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,270
is horrible.

677
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,110
You can say it's outrageous.

678
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,150
Let me read it to you.

679
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,220
Come on.

680
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,540
Father, Mother.

681
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,070
My husband is dying.

682
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,650
When the flowers bloom,

683
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,320
I can soon return.

684
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,440
Here, here's another one.

685
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,710
Father, Mother.

686
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,810
My husband's death is approaching.

687
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,280
I can soon come back.

688
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,440
What's all this?

689
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,030
It seems somehow

690
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,560
she thinks the day of the Exam will be your time of death.

691
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,190
She's waiting for you to die,

692
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,490
so she can be a widow

693
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,450
and go back to Jichuan

694
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,040
with the pension.

695
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,040
Your Highness.

696
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,130
Don't worry.

697
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,590
I will treat you well

698
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,210
for the rest of your life.

699
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,610
After you're gone,

700
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,650
I will burn some books for you from time to time.

701
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,570
From now on, when people see this painting,

702
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,460
they'll be reminded of

703
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,930
your voice and face.

704
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,900
♫ The wind talks softly to me ♫

705
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,390
♫ Listen how the time sings lightly ♫

706
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:52,350
♫ Fireworks are in full bloom, scattering the sky with the past ♫

707
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,220
♫ The stars are climbing up my heart ♫

708
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,610
♫ The eyes of the night shine with moonlight ♫

709
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:05,680
♫ Remembering your face at this time ♫

710
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:12,270
♫ We stumbled through yesterday ♫

711
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:18,770
♫ Tonight's dream slowly flows through your fingers ♫

712
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:25,820
♫ We're about to stay together for years and years ♫

713
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,340
♫ We'll travel together for years and years ♫

714
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,680
♫ The clouds are quietly looking up ♫

715
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,190
♫ The sky is light and the wind is cool and here comes a secret fragrance ♫

716
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:58,940
♫ The paper kite flutters and bids farewell to the wanderings of the past ♫

717
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,100
♫ The road ahead looks far away ♫

718
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,450
♫ The world is wide ♫

719
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:12,550
♫ Cold or warm, you're by my side ♫

720
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:18,920
♫ Spring flowers are fearless and love grows among the thorns ♫

721
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:25,510
♫ The summer breeze is dying, the sun is burning, it's all but ordinary ♫

722
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:32,550
♫ Autumn leaves fall, waiting for you and me to write a new chapter ♫

723
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,200
♫ After the winter snow comes the warm sunshine ♫

724
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:45,620
♫ We stumbled through yesterday ♫

725
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:52,150
♫ Tonight's dream slowly flows through your fingers ♫

726
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,400
♫ We're about to stay together for years and years ♫

727
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:05,290
♫ We'll travel together for years and years ♫
