[Episode 38]

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,850
Greetings, My Lord.

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,080
I didn't expect you to come in person, My Lord,

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
so I got here late.

7
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,110
Please punish me.

8
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,710
All right.

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,220
You didn't know I was coming.

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,180
I came here

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,720
to ask you something.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I plan to patrol the whole region.

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
What's your plan?

14
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,330
I will do

15
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,300
whatever you ask me to do, My Lord.

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,720
Okay.

17
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,340
Then go on patrol with me.

18
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,540
Well...

19
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,680
What?

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
You don't want to?

21
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,770
I dare not.

22
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,270
It's just that

23
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,000
An and I are in charge of the Ministry of Revenue together.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,060
Work has been busy these days.

25
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,750
I'm afraid...

26
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,590
Zheng will provide An with guidance.

27
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,880
Nothing will go wrong.

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,290
Guidance...

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,540
Jun.

30
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,630
I'll be frank with you.

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,820
You are a great official.

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,840
But now you have too many distractions.

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,050
To become a good man of mine,

34
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,930
you need to cultivate yourself.

35
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,220
If you are willing,

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,530
you can come on patrol with me.

37
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,060
If you don't want to,

38
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,990
I'll make other plans for you.

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,030
Thank you

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,850
for your guidance, Father.

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,840
I clearly remember

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,460
you were timid and quiet when you were young,

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,300
and you always stayed by Song's side

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,800
with no other intention.

45
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,860
But why

46
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,670
did you become like this?

47
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,240
When did you get on the wrong track?

48
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,780
Was it when I insisted on letting you take over the Ministry of Revenue,

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,510
or was it when

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,900
your wife An got pregnant?

51
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,150
The midwife has confessed that

52
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,180
An asked for labor induction.

53
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,380
I can't let such a Helen of Troy stay by your side.

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,480
Maybe I need to

55
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,940
get you a new legal wife.

56
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,850
Father.

57
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,720
It's all my misconduct and malicious ambition.

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
What does it have to do with the woman in the inner courtyard?

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,480
Punish me if you want.

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
How can you blame Xiyuan?

61
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,140
If you think I'm incompetent,

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,620
then punish me as you did to Song.

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,210
But Xiyuan has nothing to do with this.

64
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,530
Father.

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,190
She is my wife.

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,590
To me,

67
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,460
a wife is a person who I can rely on for life,

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,240
not a tribute that can be sacrificed at will.

69
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,650
Father.

70
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,120
Forget it.

71
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,960
If you can

72
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,850
put this kind of sincerity to good use

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,300
on other people and things in the future,

74
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,540
you can live a good life.

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,850
Yes, Father.

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,250
The first name of my eldest grandson will be Che.

77
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,650
Che means clear and transparent.

78
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,480
I hope he can be alert

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,600
and be an upright and honest person in the future,

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,250
who will never make the same mistake as you did.

81
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,130
Thank you, Father.

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,810
Why did you do that, Your Highness?

83
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,350
If you were willing to give me up,

84
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,120
maybe things could still be turned around.

85
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,710
Back when no one cared about me,

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,090
you chose me.

87
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,680
I only have you.

88
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,100
But I broke my promise.

89
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,080
The future I promised you

90
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,340
has turned into an illusion.

91
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,480
Actually,

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,140
only you

93
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,070
were willing to promise an illegitimate child like me

94
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,060
a future.

95
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,920
Father is still willing to take me on patrol.

96
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,050
That means he's giving me a chance to turn over a new leaf.

97
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,900
Xiyuan.

98
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,850
From now on,

99
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,530
let's live a peaceful life as a family,

100
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,800
shall we?

101
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,270
At least our child

102
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
is no longer an illegitimate child.

103
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,540
As the generation changes,

104
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,260
he can go further.

105
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,320

108
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,730
I agreed that you could turn Li into your legal wife.

109
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,980
Before I leave,

110
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,710
hold the conferral ceremony.

111
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,860
I'll be watching you get officially married.

112
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,260
Thank you, Father.

113
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,809
But could you please

114
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,950
allow me to take Li Wei to Jichuan

115
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,570
to meet my father-in-law before that?

116
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,390
Fine.

117
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,840
By the way,

118
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,220
there's someone from Jichuan in the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

119
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,280
Remember to ask him

120
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,470
what a son-in-law should do visiting the wife's original family.

121

Don't lose your manners.

122
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,480
Understood.

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,900
It's settled then.

124

00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,420
during this period?

130

If you need my company,

131
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,870
I'll make plans with different ministries in advance.

132
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,170
If you need me to stay,

133
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,870
I'll do my job

134
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,710
and manage the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

135
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,720
What if

136
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,340
I let you

137
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,820
take care of the imperial court affairs?

138
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,120
Then, of course, I'll first ask you about

139
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,480
the division of power and responsibilities.

140
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,880
I'll supervise the princes and officials to do their duties.

141
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,600
I'll handle everything, big or small, prudently.

142

If there is something that I can't decide,

143

I'll report it to you immediately no matter how far away you are, My Lord.

144

Good.

145
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,820
It's settled then.

146
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,380
This crown prince seal was given to me

147
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,840
by the late lord.

148

Yin Zheng.

149
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,760
I'll give it

150
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,280
to you now.

151
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,320

153
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,220
Don't bow to me.

154
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,740
Now you're the Crown Prince.

155
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,250
According to the rules,

156
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,440
you shouldn't bow to a subordinate official like me.

157
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,930
I received a bow from you when I entered the court.

158
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,480
Now,

159
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,970
please accept my bow to you.

Congratulations, Your Highness.

163
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,860
Xinchuan has been handed over to the most capable hands.

164
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,530
To be honest,

165
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,630
I'm not thrilled at all, Sir.

166
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,830
It's heavy responsibility.

167
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,160
Every step will be hard.

168
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,950
If you think so,

169
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,730
it means Lord

170
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,420
is right about you.

171
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,450
I'm here today to ask what your plan is, Sir.

172
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,650
With your talent,

173
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,880
you can choose any ministry you are interested in working at.

for your appreciation, Your Highness.

176
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,100
But you know me.

177
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,900
Compared to the imperial court,

178
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,630
I prefer to stay in my study.

179
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,490
Okay.

180
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,570
I understand what you mean.

181
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,140
Got it.

It's no easy task visiting your wife's original family.

I have to give you a hard time.

188
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,030
Give me a hard time?

189
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,100
I know what to do.

190
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,830
It's been a long time since I left.

191
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,500
The night market has become lively.

192
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,470
And I see

193
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,000
more and more women are coming out at night.

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,880
They used to wear veils to cover their faces.

195
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,680
Now it looks more like Danchuan,

196
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,310
where women can do whatever they want.

197
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,690
That stall is...

198
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,140
I didn't know Hao Jia has this side of her.

199
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,060
The way you look at me.

200
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,420
Look.

201
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:21,850
Yes.

202
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,950
I admit that I used to

203
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,370
be attracted by your good friend's appearance.

204
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,710
But there were no real feelings.

205
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,840
My love for you is like real gold, not even afraid of fire.

206
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,000
Hao Jia.

207
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,600
Shangguan.

208
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,550
Long time no see.

209
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,360
It's really been a long time.

210
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,850
You are finally back.

211
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,120
Where is Changle?

212
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,400
Your stall is named Changle,

213
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,120
but why isn't the inheritor here?

214
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,650
Exactly.

215
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,210
Since my business has grown fast,

216
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,810
I hired four or five nannies to take care of her.

217
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,210
Look over there.

218
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,950
All the stalls with the name of Changle

219
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,640
are mine.

220
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,310
You can take whatever you want.

221
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,800
Really?

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,280
Of course.

223
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,040
Thank you.

224
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,130
You're welcome.

225
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,210
Your Highness.

226
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,670
Although you seldom use rouge,

227
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,560
if you apply it once in a while,

228
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,820
Prince Qi will definitely lose his mind.

229
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,990
What are you waiting for?

230
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,400
Pay.

231
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,800
How can I pay?

232
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,680
You have all the money.

233
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,080
You don't even give me any allowance.

234
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,130
Stop it.

235
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,960
How could I ask you to pay?

236
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:27,920
Here.

237
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,320
Shangguan, take this too.

238
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,180
This suits you.

239
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,840
Thank you.

240
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,520
But I don't have anything suitable for you.

241
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,550
The kneel-easy over there suits you quite well.

242
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:38,910
This?

243
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,940
You two are ganging up to bully me.

244
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,200
Birds of a father.

245
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,090
Uncivilized.

246
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,400
It should be "birds of a fether".

247
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,800
Right?

248
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,860
It should be "birds of a feather".

249
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Sometimes she doesn't know either.

250
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,670
You two are such a perfect match,

251
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,880
fooling around together.

252
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,540
But after you have a child,

253
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,970
you need to teach him well.

254
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,090
You're right.

255
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,260
We must educate our child well.

256
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,730
But the key

257
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,680
is to have a child first.

258
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,700
Right?

259
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,480
Who wants to have a child with you?

260
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,470
Prince Zheng is in charge now.

261
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,330
There's no longer criticism on

262
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,090
girls running a stall, right?

263
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,570
Yes.

264
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,110
I've always wanted to change back into women's clothes.

265
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,040
But look at me.

266
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,440
Aren't I a bit handsome?

267
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,160
And many girls come to me every day,

268
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,690
saying they want to be Changle's stepmother.

269
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,420
So,

270
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,400
let me stay like this for a couple more days.

271
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,890
I also think you look great like this.

272
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,280
And seeing you like this,

273
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,670
I'm so happy for you.

274
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,200
Me too.

275
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,570
I'm very happy too.

276
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,300
Great.

277
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,990
I'm very happy too.

All set.

This is pure grain wine. Don't break it.

282
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,530
Be cautious.

283
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,530
You may break it.

284
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,240
Here.

285
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,080
Take it.

286
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,280
Put these two away from each other.

287
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,720
Be gentle.

288

-Aren't we going on a trip? -Don't break it.

289

Here's the thing.

292
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,890
Isn't this the first time Prince Zheng visited your family?

293
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,319
He stayed up all night,

294
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,270
thinking about what to bring.

295
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,010
Look.

296
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,170
These are for his parents-in-law,

00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,200
these for his brother-in-law,

298
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
and these are for the relatives and neighbors.

299

He did a lot of work.

It's a long journey.

What if you get in danger?

311

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,640
Wei.

380
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
-Wei, I missed you so much. -Li Cang.

381
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,300
Wei.

382
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:08,890
Mother.

383
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,440
I dreamed of you yesterday.

384
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,880
Wei.

385
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,800
Father.

386
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,600
Wei.

387
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,250
Why is he here?

388
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,870
Father-in-law.

389
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,360
Son-in-law, you are here.

390
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,350
Come on in.

391
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,690
You brought so many things.

392
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,520
Let me help you.

393
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,440
No, let me.

394
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,660
Slowly.

395
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,690
Come inside and have some tea.

396
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:33,910
Give me one.

397
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,270
You mean

398
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,530
you're willing to officially marry Wei as your legal wife?

399
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,020
Yes.

400
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,340
You came all the way here to the countryside

401
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,740
to propose marriage according to the etiquette.

402
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,720
You must love and cherish Wei a lot.

403
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,380
Yes.

404
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,840
You know the rules of Jichuan, Your Highness.

405
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,980
Monogamy.

406
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,220
But you're here again.

407
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,110
Do you think you can do it?

408
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,680
Yes.

409
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,550
Wei is willing to take you home.

410
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,610
It shows that she loves you.

411
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,860
Wei has grown up.

412
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,900
We can't stand in her way.

413
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,110
As Wei's father,

414
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,610
I'd like to say,

415
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,480
I don't agree.

416
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,890
Why?

417
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,280
No.

418
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,310
You...

419
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,330
Didn't you check?

420
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,160
Xinchuan has so many rules.

421
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,180
It's not solely up to me.

422
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Let's discuss it.

423
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,850
Raise your hand if you disagree.

424
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,340
It doesn't count.

425
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:46,740
Again.

426
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,810
Raise your hand if you agree to this marriage.

427
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,160
What are you doing?

428
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
Do you want Wei to be his legal wife

429
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,560
and stay in Xinchuan forever?

430
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,000
Of course we hope Wei can stay in Jichuan

431
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,480
and stay with us.

432
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,390
You know me.

433
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,120
But it's obvious that

434
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,880
Wei loves Prince Zheng.

435
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
Do you know how hard it is

436
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,320
to find someone you like?

437
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,550
Are you going to separate them?

438
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,150
You think so too?

439
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,290
If Wei comes back,

440
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,920
she'll steal my food again.

441
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,380
I think it's good for her to stay in Xinchuan.

442
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,780
Wei, what about you?

443
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,830
No need to ask me.

444
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,470
I disagree.

445
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,530
You don't agree?

446
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,950
Let's eat if you don't agree.

447
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,550
Okay.

448
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,310
I've made a lot of dishes.

449
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,840
Let's go.

450
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,200
Let's eat.

451
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,040
Son-in-law, let's go.

452
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,700
Time to eat.

453
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,690
These dishes today

454
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,380
are all specialities here.

455
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,750
Try them.

456
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,020
So many dishes.

457
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,850
You are so lucky.

458
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,480
Sit next to your son-in-law.

459
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,590
Talk to your son-in-law.

460
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,520
Talk about what?

461
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,240
What can we talk about with a prince of Xinchuan?

462
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,280
Come on.

463
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:12,930
Come on.

464
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,340
Son-in-law.

465
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,140
Have a seat.

466
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,370
Time to eat.

467
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,060
Here.

468
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,650
It still tastes familiar.

469
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,050
I've been dreaming about having the dishes cooked by you, Father.

470
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,020
If you like it,

471
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,860
stay in Jichuan.

472
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,560
I'll cook for you every day.

473
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,280
Why did you step on me?

474
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,920
Right, let's eat.

475
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,080
Well, Son-in-law.

476
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,720
Eat more.

477
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,160
Okay.

478
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,020
These are all our specialities.

479
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,050
Yes, and this.

480
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,980
Try this too.

481
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,740
But these are only a taste of the countryside.

482
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,540
I don't know if you'll like them.

483
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:49,850
So delicious.

484
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,800
Then eat more.

485
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,510
Give it to me if you can't eat it.

486
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,770
It's okay. I can eat it.

487
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,790
Wei told me in Xinchuan that

488
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
you're a picky eater, Prince Zheng.

489
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,040
Don't force yourself if you can't eat it, Prince Zheng.

490
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,160
Just call me Yin Zheng.

491
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,220
Prince Zheng is a prince of Xinchuan.

492
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,500
You live in clover,

493
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,920
and your health is more important than ordinary people's.

494
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,120
If you eat something bad,

495
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,720
or have a stomachache again,

496
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,280
we can't afford it.

497
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,020
Father.

498
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,560
Don't talk like that.

499
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,000
He's not like what you said.

500
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,770
Like what?

501
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,440
Did I say anything wrong?

502
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,400
Actually, my stomachache

503
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,820
has been cured by Li Wei.

504
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,550
Besides, these dishes are really delicious.

505
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,350
Like the meat.

506
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,510
Yes.

507
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,250
Son-in-law has such a good appetite.

508
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:30,810
What?

509
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,760
Are you unhappy about this too?

510
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,020
I...

511
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,950
Gosh.

512
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,810
Let's eat.

513
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,340
Li Cang.

514
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,570
Why do you only eat meat but not vegetables?

515
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,410
Who spoiled you to be such a picky eater?

516
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,930
I didn't get to eat it yet.

517
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,910
I hate picky eaters the most.

518
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,430
I'm done eating.

519
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,650
Father.

520
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:52,970
Father.

521
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,790
Li Wenbi.

522
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,240
This guy...

523
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,670
Don't mind him.

524
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,410
Father is always like this.

525
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,320
I'll talk to him later.

526
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Yes, Son-in-law.

527
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,750
Leave him alone.

528
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,520
This guy is always so stubborn.

529
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,080
Later,

530
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,200
Wei and I will talk to him.

531
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,400
I should talk to Father-in-law myself.

532
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,220
Alright.

533
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,290
That's good too.

534
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,520
Let's eat.

535
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,970
If he doesn't eat,

536
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,110
we can all eat more.

537
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,260
Come on.

538
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,240
Let him starve.

539
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,760
Have some more of this.

540
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,360
Okay.

541
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,530
Let's eat.

542
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,470
And beef.

543
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,290
Eat more beef.

544
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,650
You have to sleep with me

545
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,680
for a few days.

546
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,480
This is the rule of Jichuan.

547
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,360
Even a married couple should sleep in separate rooms back in the wife's original family.

548
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,170
No.

549
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,740
I'm very happy to.

550
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,940
This way I can have a chat with you.

551
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,980
You're eloquent,

552
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,410
and you're born with a good look.

553
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,280
You can find any girl you want.

554
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,120
The girls from Jichuan are pure in nature.

555
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,650
They're easy to be deceived

556
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,970
and tricked.

557
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,990
Originally,

558
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,800
I wanted Wei

559
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,320
to stay in Jichuan forever,

560
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,850
and find someone who can take good care of her.

561
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,340
Who can protect her

562
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,150
if she's with you in Xinchuan?

563
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,880
Actually, I understand your concerns.

564
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
From the moment I came in,

565
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,290
you've been emphasizing that I'm a prince.

566
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
You're just worried that I'm someone who lives in clover

567
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,240
and doesn't know how to take care of others.

568
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
But I promise you,

569
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,520
I'll keep her safe for the rest of my life

570
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,180
in Xinchuan.

571
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,130
All bark and no bite.

572
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,240
You can make a request.

573
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,570
Anything.

574
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
I will do anything

575
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,150
until you trust me.

576
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,040
You can ask for anything.

577
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,760
Anything.

578
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,860
I need to think about it.

579
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,110
Go to bed.

580
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,850
I'm so tired.

581
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,160
Brother-in-law,

582
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,080
I'll do it if you can't.

583
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,720
It's okay.

584
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,760
It's not okay.

585
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,970
Jichuan's chickens are fierce.

586
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,570
It's not an easy task.

587
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,210
Even Li Cang can't do it.

588
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,610
I'm the only one in the family who can do it.

589
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,270
Learn to back off in face of difficulties.

590
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,010
I'll boil water first.

591
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:56,940
I'll do it later.

592
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,600
I can do it.

593
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:58,610
Let me.

594
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Brother-in-law.

595
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,800
Why is there no sound?

596
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,420
Was he eaten by a chicken?

597
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,180
I got them.

598
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,480
So noisy.

599
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,470
So clumsy.

600
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,310
Brother-in-law,

601
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,170
you are so good.

602
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,660
Right?

603
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,140
There's more.

604
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,890
You really want to learn it?

605
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,260
It's hard.

606
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,520
If you can learn it,

607
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,520
I really admire you.

608
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,010
Only Wei's mother is good at chopping in our family.

609
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,950
I've just been doing my best.

610
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,190
Learn from me.

611
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,970
The aim is important.

612
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,750
You have to be quick and precise.

613
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,520
Look.

614
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:25,950
You failed.

615
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,540
It's hard, right?

616
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,200
Indeed.

617
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,540
Lucky.

618
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,290
Lucky.

619
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,040
Again.

620
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:52,980
Again.

621
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,540
Again.

622
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,690
Lucky.

623
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,000
Go on.

624
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,490
Go on.

625
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,190
Go on.

626
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,040
No.

627
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,170
I have to criticize you.

628
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,680
Your pace of chopping is wrong.

629
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,170
We are all like this.

630
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,120
Your pace is messed up.

631
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,520
It's not pleasant at all.

632
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,880
I'll...

633
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,970
I'll try my best.

634
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,580
You can't even chop wood properly.

635
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,900
How can you take good care of my daughter?

636
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
Brother-in-law,

637
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,280
you chopped the wood so well.

638
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,930
We've got enough firewood for the next month.

639
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,830
You look weak,

640
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,330
but you are actually quite strong.

641
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,570
Much better than my father.

642
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,500
Why are you here?

643
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,280
Shouldn't you be doing your homework?

644
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,410
Go back to your room.

645
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,150
Naughty.

646
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,340
Go back.

647
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,280
Go back.

648
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,060
Come on.

649
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,220
Dinner is ready.

650
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,190
Top-quality straw.

651
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,290
And some dessert.

652
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,740
San'er, why don't you eat?

653
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
It only eats mine.

654
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,850
It's eating so happily.

655
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,650
Father-in-law.

656
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,080
I've fed San'er and Si'er.

657
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,810
Then run another errand for me.

658
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,170
Carry this.

659
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,860
This is the map of Wolf Hunting Mountain.

660
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
Wei's favourite dessert is made of sophora flowers.

661
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,560
Wolf Hunting Mountain has the best sophora flowers nearby.

662
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,000
As long as you come back with enough sophora flowers,

663
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,200
you'll pass the test.

664
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,290
OK.

665
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,020
Wait.

666
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,960
Have you thought it through?

667
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,640
The mountain is high and dangerous.

668
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,170
There are wolves at night.

669
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,070
You have to come back before dusk.

670
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,550
If you can't, forget it.

671
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,800
I can.

672
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,010
Brother-in-law.

673
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,680
Be careful.

674
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,700
Father.

675
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,230
Aren't you being too cruel?

676
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,210
Have you forgotten

677
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,770
how badly my sister fell last time when she went picking sophora flowers?

678
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,170
You always take his side.

679
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,420
And you.

680
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,200
Eating food from whoever gives it to you.

681
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,560
You saw how a prince like him

682
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,440
worked so hard with no complaint,

683
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,290
and you got softhearted?

684
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,440
You have no guts.

685
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,930
Where did my son-in-law go?

686
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,040
I didn't expect it.

687
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,530
Nothing has ever happened to those who go to the Wolf Hunting Mountain in the daytime.

688
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,880
It's already night. Why hasn't he come back?

689
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,340
Wei.

690
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,720
Didn't you say he knows martial arts?

691
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,970
Li Wenbi.

692
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,010
You said you wanted to test him today,

693
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,000
and I didn't stop you, right?

694
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,800
You asked me to take Wei out for a day.

695
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,970
I listened to you.

696
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,790
But you've gone too far.

697
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,690
You asked Xinchuan's prince to go somewhere

698
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,560
you don't dare to go?

699
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,510
You...

700
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:58,690
Calm down.

701
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,670
Exactly.

702
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,090
I told you

703
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,050
you shouldn't have let my brother-in-law go to Wolf Hunting Mountain.

704
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,560
Wei.

705
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,040
Don't worry.

706
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,120
I've asked Uncle Zhang and Uncle Wang to look for him.

707
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,280
They are all hunters.

708
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,620
They will find him.

709
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,160
Mother.

710
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,320
Let's report this to the local government

711
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,100
and send more people to look for him.

712
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,320
I'll inform Magistrate Zhu

713
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,040
and let him search the mountain.

714
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,000
Go.

715
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,790
We found him.

716
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,780
We're back.

717
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
Brother-in-law.

718
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,350
Son-in-law, you are back.

719
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,520
What happened?

720
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,880
Nothing. Just some skin lesions.

721
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,490
Let me see.

722
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,370
I'm fine.

723
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,280
No need to look.

724
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,650
What happened?

725
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,720
Nothing happened at first.

726
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,290
It's just it was hard to find sophora flowers.

727
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,410
He went too far and got delayed on the way.

728
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,810
But after we found him,

729
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,340
we really saw wolves on our way back.

730
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,240
Wolves?

731
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,640
Don't worry.

732
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,770
We are experienced.

733
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,330
We drove the wolves away with a torch of fire.

734
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,580
Your son-in-law is a really good man.

735
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,680
I almost got scratched by the alpha wolf.

736
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
He covered for me

737
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,080
and got injured himself.

738
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,480
Fortunately, the wound is not deep.

739
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,210
I've taken care of it on the way.

740
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:55,950
Don't worry.

741
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,200
Hunter Zhang.

742
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,430
Thank you.

743
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,090
No need.

744
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,520
-Thank you, Zhang. -No big deal.

745
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,070
Thank you.

746
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,000
Thank you, Wang.

747
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:02,870
Thank you.

748
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,660
He's alright.

749
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,480
We'll leave now.

750
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,030
Okay.

751
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,170
Thank you.

752
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,050
But the basket is broken.

753
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,080
And many sophora flowers were lost.

754
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,940
Only a few left.

755
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,610
But it should be enough to make dessert.

756
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,790
Still talking about sophora flowers.

757
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,719
You're injured.

758
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,800
It's just a minor injury.

759
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,600
I can still walk.

760
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:21,929
Look.

761
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,550
Let's go inside.

762
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,889
Slowly.

763
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:28,900
Go.

764
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,750
Father-in-law.

765
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:43,820
Let me see.

766
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,050
Here.

767
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
This is the special herb in Jichuan.

768
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,040
Don't mind the smell.

769
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,560
It's very effective for scratches.

770
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,850
I... I...

771
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:57,770
It's okay.

772
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,020
-I can do it myself. -Let me.

773
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,130
Let him do it.

774
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,030
He will feel better.

775
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,590
Your Highness.

776
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,720
I made you some soup.

777
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Drink some later.

778
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,130
Okay.

779
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,840
Thank you.

780
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,070
Wei and I

781
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,980
went out for a whole day today.

782
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,960
We only found out

783
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,000
how he tortured you after we got back.

784
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,080
He wouldn't let me and Wei get involved.

785
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,940
He is

786
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,020
actually a good man.

787
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,050
It's just that he can't control himself when it comes to our daughter.

788
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,860
Your Highness,

789
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,000
please forgive us.

790
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,090
As a father-in-law, he doesn't need to control himself.

791
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,770
Besides,

792
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,020
I'm only Yin Zheng, not a prince here.

793
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm still sorry for what happened today.

794
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,640
Actually, Father-in-law warned me about it before I left

795
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,390
that I can't spend the night on Wolf Hunting Mountain.

796
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,120
I've spend too much time there.

797
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,790
Next time,

798
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,050
I'll go earlier.

799
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,620
I might be able to get more sophora flowers.

800
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,380
Actually, he has already approved of you

801
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,680
since you were willing to do so much for Wei.

802
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,700
We know

803
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,360
how well you treat Wei.

804
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,910
It's just that

805
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,030
he has all sorts of worries.

806
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,940
Actually, I always have an idea.

807
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,160
I want to buy a house for you two in Xinchuan.

808
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,930
This way, you can come and stay in Xinchuan whenever you want,

809
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,330
and you can supervise me.

810
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,330
Are you serious?

811
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,610
I'm not talking about the house.

812
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,000
You mean you are willing to let us go visit you at any time?

813
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,490
It's my duty to buy a house for you.

814
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,960
I hope you don't mind

815
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,750
or refuse.

816
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,790
Don't blame me for overstepping.

817
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,420
I'm afraid that

818
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,100
you only treat Li Wei like this for now,

819
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,260
being willing to do anything.

820
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,740
But the selection of nine regions is every three years.

821
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,300
Newcomers keep coming in.

822
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,560
How should Wei suit herself then?

823
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,900
We raised Wei.

824
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,760
If her marriage changes in the future,

825
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,560
won't she make her own decision?

826
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,910
You should have more faith in her.

827
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,460
Father-in-law,

828
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,260
Li Wei is really competent.

829
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,640
Women's Chamber of Commerce has branches

830
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,960
everywhere in Xinchuan.

831
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,690
She also earns a lot through it.

832
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,580
It's even more money than

833
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,840
what we princes earn in the imperial court.

834
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,390
So,

835
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,090
she has the confidence to not compromise.

836
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,930
Don't worry.

837
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,540
Wei also mentioned in her letter

838
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,690
about doing business.

839
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,430
We know about that.

840
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,490
Women in Xinchuan are not allowed to do business,

841
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
but Li Wei managed to do it.

842
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,530
You must have helped a lot.

843
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,900
But it's still her efforts that matter the most.

844
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,250
Wei wants to run her own business outside the palace,

845
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,010
and you've got no problem with that?

846
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,090
Li Wei only belongs to herself.

847
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,640
She wants to do business outside.

848
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,170
I'm in no position to say no.

849
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,690
She's a pure girl, but she's very thoughtful.

850
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,920
I know

851
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,940
you still need time to gain trust in me.

852
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,270
But you can trust Li Wei.

853
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,530
She won't let herself be mistreated.

854
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,730
Slowly.

855
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,330
I can do it.

856
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,620
Your Highness, what are you...

857
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,110
I, Yin Zheng,

858
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,670
would like to marry your daughter as my legal wife.

859
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,020
I want to register at the county government as a new family

860
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,030
according to Jichuan's convention.

861
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,470
And we'll burn incense sticks at the God of Matchmaking Temple.

862
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,000
I will never change my mind.

863
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,320
As a prince,

864
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,810
you're willing to follow the rules of the remote countryside?

865
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,000
The God of Matchmaking Temple is very efficacious.

866
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,080
Anyone who breaks the vow they make at the God of Matchmaking Temple

867
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,340
will end up miserable.

868

870
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,960
Aren't you afraid of that?

871
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Since I made a vow,

872
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,360
I won't go back on my word.

873
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,130

938
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
I will be struck by lightning and...

939
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,250
Stop talking nonsense.

940
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,890
The God of Matchmaking is very efficacious.

941
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,690
That's why we are making our vows here.

942
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,400
Anyway, don't say that.

943
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,190
Okay.

944
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,400
This tree is very efficacious.

945
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,060
We can write down some wishes.

946
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,050
There's no pen here.

947
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,120
Wait.

948
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,640
Here it is.

949
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,880
There's no inkstone either.

950
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,390
Just wait.

951
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,040
Got it.

952
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,770
What else do you have?

953
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,620
I must figure it out some time.

954
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:43,400
Yuan Ying's, Shangguan's, Hao Jia's,

955
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,920
my parents', Li Cang's, grandparents',

956
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:46,920
Haitang's,

957
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:47,770
and Sisi's.

958
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,000
All done.

959
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,130
Alright.

960
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,740
Hang it higher.

961
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,840
Okay.

962
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,540
Hang it higher.

963
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,850
Successfully fail...

964
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,340
You can't read it.

965
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,860
-Find my true love. -You can't read it.

966
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,640
You can't read it.

967
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,130
I wrote it before I left.

968
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,450
Looks like this tree is quite efficacious.

969
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,250
Half of the wish would come true.

970
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,520
Write your own.

971
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,010
Successfully fail the selection

972
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,210
and find my true love.

973
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,940
Three meals every day,

974
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,260
and a peaceful world.

975
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,570
Travel through time idly,

976
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,180
and good weather for the crops.

977
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,580
The country flourishes,

978
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,300
and the people live in peace.

979
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,810
♫The south wind meets the clouds♫

980
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,480

981
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,260
♫As far as the eye can see, it's just a regular sight♫

982
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,740
♫Why am I being absent-minded? And why am I hesitating?♫

983

♫I've got some affection towards you♫

♫Who should I tell about the one I love?♫

988

♫By now, my words have turned into wind, and my thoughts of you has melted into fog♫

989
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,060
♫I wrote about the past into a letter♫

990

♫I love you deeply and there's nothing else I ask for♫

993
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:33,170
♫I only wish the two of us could love each other as one soul, eat three meals together and spend the four seasons together♫
