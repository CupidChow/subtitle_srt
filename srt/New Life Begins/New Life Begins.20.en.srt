00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,150
but ended with a bookshop owner.

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,740
This bookshop is Mr Song's family property.

7
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,070
His parents died.

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,050
He relied on the bookshop to raise his sister,

9
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,380
earned enough tuition,

10
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,220
and hired a teacher to prepare for the imperial exam.

11
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,950
I've met him.

12
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,840
He's a trustworthy person.

13
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,440
But with his background,

14
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,500
what if he wants to take advantage of Song Wu?

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,780
Madam He, don't worry.

16
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,060
We've checked his character these days.

17
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,370
He's not someone who curries favor with those in power.

18
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,740
Madam,

19
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,080
we will tell you what happened these days.

20
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,590
You'll understand.

21
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,420
We went to the night market with Song Wu that day.

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,140
But we were separated by the crowd.

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,700
Who owes you money?

27
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,230
No one owes me money.

28
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,290
Come here. Let me talk to you.

29
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,670
Madam Xinchuan knew about

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,770
me helping Song Wu chase Song Wu.

31
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,329
She called Song Wu over

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,340
and scolded her.

33
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,470
I was there.

34
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,430
I was thinking...

35
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,880
I'll say something for Song Wu.

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,340
But they laughed at me.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,730
What did you say?

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,770
I said

39
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,840
Song Wu's foolish move was just a one time thing.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,240
As long as she's willing to rain in at the brink,

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,370
it's forgivable.

42
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,110
But Song Wu said...

43
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,570
it's not rain.

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,290
It's rein.

45
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,680
It's rein in at the brink.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,550
She said that

47
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,210
leaving the horse in rain is animal abuse.

48
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,370
Then Madam Xinchuan punished me to come back to copy books.

49
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,120
I was too embarrassed to correct them.

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,440
Those ignorant people.

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,750
It should be rain.

52
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,900
That's right.

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,970
It's rain.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Rain in at the brink.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,310
Yes, that's what it is.

56
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,290
You should use rein.

57
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,160
It's not good for you to correct Madam Xinchuan

58
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,300
and embarrass her.

59
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,940
Right.

60
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,350
When I think about it, my head hurts.

61
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,730
No. Speaking of which,

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,660
my head starts to hurt.

63
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,480
I can't take it anymore.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,740
What are you doing?

65
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,870
I haven't asked you what you're doing.

66
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,579
I'm tired.

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,240
I just want to lean on you.

Okay.

Go ahead.

Your handwriting is so scribbled.

74
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,280
What's wrong with my handwriting?

75
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,600
What's wrong with my handwriting?

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Copy yourself.

77

I don't care.

78
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,890
No, Shangguan.

79
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,620
I didn't mean that, Shangguan.

80
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,730
I was wrong.

81
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,550
I'll take another step back, let's each copy half.

82
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,370
It is a rare occasion today.

83
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,590
Zheng finally came to the palace

84
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,420
to have a meal with your mother.

85
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:43,550
Yes.

86
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,990
He's been busy with Mochuan lately.

87
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,100
Zheng did a good job

88
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,750
with Mochuan.

89
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,400
I haven't asked you

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,230
what reward do you want.

91
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,300
I do want one thing.

92
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:00,940
Go ahead.

93
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,230
Mother and I have found a suitable candidate

94
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,990
to marry Princess Kening.

95
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,580
I beg your permission, Your Majesty.

96
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,330
What kind of person is he?

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,250
A student.

98
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,320
A civilian?

99
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,450
Their backgrounds really do not match.

100
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,970
But Zheng brought the article he wrote.

101
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,660
I think it's good.

102
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,670
Really?

103
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,350
He is indeed talented.

104
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,409
Song Wu is reckless.

105
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,530
If we can find an upright person to discipline her,

106
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,940
I think

107
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,260
it's quite good.

108
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,020
But she is your adopted daughter after all.

109
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,980
I also conferred her the title.

110
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,400
Think about it.

111
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,930
Is it appropriate for a princess

112
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,610
to marry a civilian?

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,380
Although he comes from a poor family,

114
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,130
he is talented.

115
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,320
If he can pass the imperial exam...

116
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,570
Even if he did,

117
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,670
Song Wu can't really marry him.

118
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,700
Otherwise,

119
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,950
all the Princes and Princesses in Xinchuan

120
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,040
will want to get married following their hearts.

121
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,170
How inappropriate!

122
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,750
For the children of Xinchuan Palace,

123
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,750
marriage is also a responsibility.

124
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,500
We can't leave them to their own devices.

125
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,360
Not to mention breaking the rules

126
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,040
because of her.

127
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,490
My Lord.

128
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,440
I understand your concerns.

129
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,490
Xinchuan's rules shouldn't be broken

130
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,490
because of me.

131
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,760
So I earnestly request that

132
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,070
you abolish my title as Princess.

133
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,200
Shut up!

134
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,880
Godmother,

135
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,570
I thought this through.

136
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,350
This is the perfect way.

137
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,280
I've already decided on this marriage.

138
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,770
I will never regret.

139
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,970
Expelling me from the palace

140
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,990
can also warn the court ladies.

141
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,530
If they break the rules,

142
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,010
they will end up like me.

143

145
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,760
I just want to be a civilian.

146

Please grant my wish.

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,280
Song Wu.

148
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,520
Are you sure you won't regret

149
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,450
what you just said?

150
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:50,100
I won't regret it.

Song Wu.

152
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,790
They said if I were the princess,

153
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,510
I wouldn't be able to be with you.

154
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,080
So I'm not a Princess anymore.

155
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm no longer Princess Kening of Xinchuan Palace,

nor goddaughter of Madam He.

160

I'm a civilian who has nothing.

161

Will you still be with me?

162
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,710
I don't care about that.

163
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,290

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,310
But now,

192
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,010
I really don't want to leave you.

193
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,200
If he treats you badly

194
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,270
or bullies you,

195
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,550
we won't let him go.

196
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,930
Jinzhan.

197
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,190
Jinping.

198
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,550
I'll set aside some money from my personal savings.

199
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,010
When you leave the palace,

200
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,700
I'll give it to you as your dowry.

201
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,760
Miss.

202
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,350
I'm leaving.

203
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,150
You don't have to see me off.

204
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,540
Thank you

205
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,910
for taking care of me these days.

206
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,010
Song Wu.

207
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,150
Farewell.

208
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,810
I really envy her.

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,730
She can live the life she wants.

210
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,570
In the future,

211
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,250
she will only follow her heart.

212
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,230
Today, the sugar cake is made with half sugar.

213
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,160
It's summer now.

214
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,770
We should eat less sugar.

215
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,910
It's delicious.

216
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,990
Thank you, Chef Liu.

217
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,800
It's my duty.

218
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,860
Your Highness are officially a member of the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

219
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,260
According to the previous rules,

220
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,540
we must hold a Renbin Banquet.

221
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,880
Yes.

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,930
Renbin Banquet?

223
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,760
The other eight regions sent envoys

224
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,930
here to stay for communication.

225
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
When the person in charge of the Nine Regions Affairs Division takes office,

226
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,740
he always hosts a banquet for the envoys from the other eight regions.

227
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,460
It's called the Renbin Banquet.

228
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,590
You don't know that?

229
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,070
I added a note for you on this.

230
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,470
You haven't finished reading the Ritual Records of the Nine Regions, have you?

231
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,590
Go back and copy the books.

232
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,460
Prince Zheng is busy.

233
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,570
Leave it to Li Wei and me.

234
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,140
If she wants to be the lady of the house,

235
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,470
she must be able to hold the banquet alone.

236
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,240
This is a good opportunity.

237
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,080
After the Renbin Banquet, I'll find a chance

238
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,360
to persuade father to let women do business.

239
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,770
You want to open a restaurant.

240
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,010
You have to do it legitimately.

241
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,280
Or there will be more trouble.

242
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,010
Don't worry.

243
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,690
Yuan Ying and I

244
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,890
will do a good job on the Renbin Banquet.

245
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,340
Thank you for your understanding.

246
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,140
We will do our best.

247
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,230
Thank you.

248
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,310
Here, eat.

249
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,940
According to Ms. Yuan Ying's teaching

250
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,760
and the experience of the last banquet,

251
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,400
I tried to make the procedure

252
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,000
for Renbin Banquet as simple as possible.

253
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,050
For seating,

254
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,600
I separated the envoys

255
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,150
from Danchuan and Mochuan.

256
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,400
They don't get along in private.

257
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,570
The further, the better.

258
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,640
As for the menu,

259
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,500
I discussed with Liu Baoquan.

260
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,010
We chose some light dishes.

261
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,380
That way,

262
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,170
people won't have digestion problems

263
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,160
after eating.

264
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,220
On the wine list,

265
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,270
I prepared water for Prince Zheng.

266
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,690
The wine from different regions will be placed accordingly.

267
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,770
As for the rest,

268
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,870
Ms. Yuan Ying can check later.

269
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:46,730
Madam,

270
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,060
Concubine Wei worked very hard this time.

271
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,120
She stayed up for several nights to come up with it.

272
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,780
Aren't you going to praise me?

273
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,130
This time,

274
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,980
I can give you eight points.

275
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,460
You've improved a lot.

276
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,740
After I leave,

277
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,480
you will be a good wife.

278
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,990
I'm not asking you to praise me like that.

279
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,870
I really want to hold this banquet well

280
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,640
so that Lord Xinchuan would

281
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,970
let the girls do business outside.

282
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,760
Then we can open a restaurant

283
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,590
with Haitang.

284
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,590
Our small step

285
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,520
is a big step for Xinchuan women.

286
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,040
I'll continue to prepare according to this.

287
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,530
Go.

288
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,020
[Examine Oneself]

289
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,040
Is this really pretty?

290
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,820
-Should I change into plain-color ones? -No.

291
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,410
This one.

292
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,960
Concubine looks the best in this.

293
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,060
Yes, Your Ladyship.

294
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,200
You need to wear bright colors.

295
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,300
They make your skin look like jade.

296
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,300
Really?

297
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,270
I'm almost shy. You...

298
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,079
Concubine is so strong.

299
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,940
Come, sit down.

300
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,099
Concubine

301
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,290
looks so different from usual.

302
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,890
Yes.

303
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,180
But Concubine

304
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,280
is naturally beautiful and pretty.

305
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,040
As the saying goes,

306
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,680
a broken boat also has three pounds of nails.

307
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:37,950
Look.

308
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,350
This banquet,

309
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,630
from the menu to the procedures,

310
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,360
was all decided by Concubine.

311
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,650
Concubine is a worthy mistress.

312
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,170
Stop talking nonsense.

313
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,040
It's not good if others hear it.

314
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,770
But it's the truth.

315
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,620
No.

316
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,580
No matter how close I am with Princess Yuan Ying,

317
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,640
you can't say that.

318
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,830
Understand?

319
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,960
-Yes. -Yes.

320
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,430
Concubine is so beautiful.

321
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,630
[Garden of Tranquility]

322
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,320
Princess.

323
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,820
Please get in the car.

324
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,410
Your Ladyship, may I have a word with you?

325
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,980
Your Ladyship.

326
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,450
Well,

327
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,620
Lady Ying is the only one who can attend this banquet.

328
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,330
Why?

329
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,780
Madam Xinchuan

330
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,300
ordered it just now.

331
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,060
But Li Wei was there

332
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,690
for the opening banquet.

333
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,690
The opening banquet is held at home.

334
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,120
This banquet is for business.

335
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,760
And it's held in the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

336
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,960
Madam Xinchuan asked about it herself.

337
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,600
I have no choice.

338
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,100
Don't worry about that.

339
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,980
Just get in the car.

340
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,850
No.

341
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,940
It's okay.

342
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,000
It's just a banquet.

343
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,320
At the banquet,

344
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,990
a bunch of Prince Zheng's colleagues will be there.

345
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,050
They are all strangers.

346
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,910
I'm so nervous.

347
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,220
It's OK not to go.

348
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,820
There are

349
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,400
a lot of things to do at home.

350
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,240
For the visit to Mochuan last time,

351
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,290
we left you alone at home.

352
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,640
This time, Baifu and I will stay.

353
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,880
Don't worry.

354
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,610
But Li Wei...

355
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,710
What's wrong?

356
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,540
Let's go.

357
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,580
Baifu is sick.

358
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,550
I have to stay and take care of Baifu.

359
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,700
So you go.

360
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,700
Yes.

361
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,390
Yes.

362
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,730
Prince, look.

363
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,920
It's getting late.

364
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,990
This is official business.

365
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,790
Don't be late.

366
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,150
Don't miss the auspicious time.

367
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,680
Let's go.

368
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,490
Remember to bring me

369
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
two packs of Chen's green bean cake.

370
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,810
I won't forget.

371
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,770
Prince Zheng won't forget.

372
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,880
Please get in the car.

373
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,230
Listen.

374
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,880
Concubine must want these when she comes back.

375
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,250
Your Ladyship, why are you back?

376
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,280
Where are Prince and the others?

377
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,550
I just feel a little tired.

378
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,220
I don't want to go anymore.

379
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
I just let them go.

380
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,930
Are you tired?

381
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,740
No.

382
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
But you really wanted to go just now.

383
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,740
No.

384
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,970
It's just a banquet.

385
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,490
I made the menu.

386
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,750
I know what to eat.

387
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,770
There's nothing delicious.

388
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,460
There are many rules.

389
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,220
I'll still be hungry after the banquet.

390
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,680
Forget it.

391
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,760
She's crying.

392
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,990
What happened?

393
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm just fishing for the moon in the water.

394
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,190
Why does Xinchuan

395
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,020
have so many stupid rules?

396
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
It's said to be the head of the nine regions.

397
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,000
I think any other region is better than Xinchuan.

398
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,290
I wonder who made these rules.

399
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,860
That man is really...

400
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,940
The chili in the gutter

401
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,140
is sinister and vicious.

402
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,850
A turtle eats coal.

403
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,510
Black-hearted little bastard.

404
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,820
Your Ladyship,

405
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,450
please be careful with your words.

406
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,360
You're scolding the former Lord Xinchuan.

407
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,370
Yes, Your Ladyship.

408
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,620
Why don't you keep it down?

409
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,250
If Prince Zheng hears you when he's back,

410
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,930
you'll be in trouble.

411
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,240
Yes.

412
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,190
He...

413
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,960
According to my procedures,

414
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,360
he's...

415
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,210
He's having a good time at the table.

416
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,790
Then I wish him drunk

417
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:23,560
and show the real him in front of everyone.

418
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,950
What real him?

419
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,060
I don't know.

420
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,370
Your Ladyship, be careful.

421
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,300
What do you mean?

422
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Even you bully me.

423
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,930
-Prince. -Prince.

424
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,140
Prince.

425
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,180
Are you alright?

426
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,480
Prince.

427
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,730
Get up.

428
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,890
Who is it?

429
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,260
Hang in there.

430
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,930
I'm worried so I came back early.

431
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,000
But you...

432
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
You threw it well.

433
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,270
Sorry.

434
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,500
I didn't mean it.

435
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,430
Sorry for what happened today.

436
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:13,890
It's my fault.

437
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,990
If you are unhappy in the future,

438
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,050
just tell me.

439
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,130
Don't hold it in.

440
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,360
There are so many stupid rules in Xinchuan.

441
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,550
Every one

442
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,130
seems to be used to make things difficult for others.

443
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,310
I've tried my best

444
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,360
for the Renbin Banquet.

445
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,770
I worked so hard

446
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,100
and thought of many ideas.

447
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,630
I thought I would see the results soon.

448
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,910
But they stopped me from going.

449
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,660
You didn't do anything wrong.

450
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,320
I did nothing wrong.

451
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,120
And Yuan Ying did nothing wrong.

452
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,120
But everyone is unhappy.

453
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,060
What can I do?

454
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,700
I'll tell you now.

455
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,710
Don't worry about me.

456
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,870
Let me calm down for a few days.

457
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,990
Baifu.

458
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,950
Am I too much?

459
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,430
But I'm really unhappy.

460
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,180
You're Xinchuan's puppy.

461
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,000
Do you like this place?

462
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,640
I'll take you to Jichuan sometime.

463
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,960
It's a beautiful place.

464
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,190
And it's free there.

465
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,420
You will like it.

466
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,640
Anyway, it's 100 times better than this place.

467
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,380
Are you torturing Baifu by staying up so late?

468
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,650
You didn't sleep either.

469
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,570
Go play by yourself.

470
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,020
I

471
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,450
came to apologize to you.

472
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,410
Why?

473
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,320
Madam Xinchuan made this rule

474
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,620
for me, the Princess of Jinchuan.

475
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,480
Rumor has it that Prince Zheng adores you more.

476
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,040
She didn't let you go because she didn't want to hurt me.

477
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,670
You worked so hard but didn't get to go.

478
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,500
It's my fault.

479
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,830
It's not your fault.

480
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,660
What's worth blaming is that

481
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,790
Xinchuan has too many bullshit rules.

482
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,090
Maybe one day,

483
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,270
we can all become someone

484
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
who can change the old rules.

485
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,870
You did everything perfectly.

486
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,100
I thought you are the one

487
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,280
who can adapt to the rules the most.

488
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
Adaptation does not mean identification.

489
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,140
It's just that I can't change it for the time being.

490
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,800
I always think

491
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,920
I'm better than my brothers.

492
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,950
I'm more suitable to work in the palace.

493
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,880
Unfortunately, Jinchuan has never had a female official.

494
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,390
I can only follow the rules

495
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,750
to marry here.

496
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,860
The wish to be a female official

497
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,750
might never come true.

498
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,190
No.

499
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,210
As long as you want to do something,

500
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,950
you will get it done.

501
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,620
I trust you.

502
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,030
Thank you.

503
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,990
Maybe one day,

504
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,320
I'll become strong enough

505
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,750
to change the rules

506
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,580
and stop being subjected to secular prejudice.

507
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,860
By then,

508
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,470
I hope I can protect more women

509
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,150
so that they can travel around

510
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,550
freely.

511
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,080
I don't seem to have such a noble dream.

512
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,740
I just want to

513
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,100
live freely

514
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,480
and protect the people I want to protect.

515
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,110
Now I also hope that all the women in the world

516
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,500
can live the life they want.

517
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,900
In this way,

518
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,250
all the hard work now will be meaningful.

519
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,120
Zheng.

520
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,510
Did you get beaten at home?

521
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,930
When I see you like this,

522
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,050
I'll think of when Shangguan hit me.

523
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
Exactly the same.

524
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,310
So shameful.

525
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,470
What do you mean?

526
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,800
I'm saying you're ugly.

527
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,720
You're ugly.

528
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,800
Come, Zheng.

529
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,660
A toast to you.

530
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,920
This Renbin Banquet is very good.

531
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,810
These old men from the Nine Regions Affairs Division

532
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,410
couldn't stop praising you.

533
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,970
It's all thanks to them.

534
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,340
Who?

535
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,830
The two of them.

536
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,480
You three are getting along well.

537
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,010
What are you talking about?

538
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,910
You're in a good mood.

539
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,080
Zheng.

540
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,430
You don't know.

541
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,610
Jing

542
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,550
is getting along well with me recently.

543
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,220
She has changed.

544
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,530
Madam Xinchuan punish me to copy books.

545
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,420
She copied half of it for me.

546
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,510
Do you think

547
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,430
she owes you money?

548
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,560
Is she running away?

549
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,210
What are you talking about?

550
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,860
You two

551
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,800
are not only ugly,

552
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,810
but also evil.

553
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,830
You can do whatever you want.

554
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,460
An, why don't you seem unhappy

555
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,660
since the beginning?

556
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,750
I just don't understand.

557
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,120
I treated them so well.

558
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,810
Why are they doing this to me?

559
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,800
Help yourself.

560
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,830
Thank you.

561
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,130
Is what Prince Zheng said true?

562
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,050
Is he really willing to support us to open a restaurant?

563
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,230
He did say that.

564
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,200
But I don't know if Lord Xinchuan will agree.

565
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,330
We'll talk about it later.

566
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,850
Since Prince Zheng said so,

567
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,090
it's very touching.

568
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,480
He's really a good man.

569
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,690
He's much better than An.

570
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,360
That's right.

571
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,070
I finally escaped from there.

572
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,810
I hope I will never see him in my life.

573
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,510
It's a risky move to inform Lord Xinchuan.

574
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,340
But due to our special identities,

575
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,780
we need to let the palace know.

576
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,430
Otherwise, there will be endless troubles.

577
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,230
But if it's rejected,

578
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,200
it will never work again.

579
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,540
Don't worry.

580
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,170
All of us understand.

581
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,760
We are partners now.

582
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,000
Even if there is any risk,

583
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
we will bear it together.

584

If we fail,

585
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,740
it's not the end either.

586
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,420
There must be another way.

587
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,460
I've thought about it.

588

But in the future,

we may be able to help more women.

591

But it's too early to say this now.

This is the plan Li Wei and I made.

600

We can start from the restaurant address.

601
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,980
Let's take the 48 alleys in the east market as an example.

602
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,350
There are twenty owners that are transferring their shops.

603
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,190
We can split up to check on site

604
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,070
before making a conclusion.

605
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,610

754
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,140
Okay.

755
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,100
I think

756
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,790
we don't know about management anyway.

757
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,000
Why don't we leave it to Yuan Ying and Li Wei?

758
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,540
We

759
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,910
will be your assistants.

760
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,640
Just call us if you need help.

761
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,350
Okay.

762
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:17,960
By the way,

763
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,260
how's the rent going?

764
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Don't mention it.

765
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,820
No one wants to rent the shop to women

766
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,450
in the entire Xinchuan.

767
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,570
Are they crazy?

768
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,060
I'll go with you next time.

769
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,390
How dare they discriminate against women?

770
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,250
I'll stab them.

771
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,860
When Xinchuan girls want to do business,

772
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,260
renting shops is the smallest trouble.

773
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,790
I'm afraid there will be more difficulties in the future.

774
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,450
We can't solve it all by force.

775
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,480
We have to think of other ways.

776
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,690
Please enjoy.

777
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,230
OK.

778
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:53,920
Perfect.

779
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,820
Okay.

780
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,020
See you next time.

781
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,070
The owner is so stingy.

782
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,330
The business is booming.

783
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,340
Why doesn't he recruit more people?

784
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,780
Is he really going to use us as donkeys?

785
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,440
You won't even be able to be a donkey in a few days.

786
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,410
I heard that the owner is going to transfer the shop.

787
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,130
Is that true?

788
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,980
The night market is booming recently.

789
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,010
We have to open at night.

790
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,500
But the owner thinks it's too much work,

791
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,620
so he wants to go back to his hometown Jichuan to take care of his child.

792
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,460
If he does transfer the shop,

793
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,250
I don't even know where to go.

794
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,350
Your owner and I are from the same hometown.

795
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,510
Since he wants to transfer the shop,

796
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,910
why not transfer it to me?

797
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,510
Yes.

798
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,120
We like this shop.

799
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,260
Ask your owner to name the price.

800
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,150
You two are...

801
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,700
We need a long-term plan to transfer the shop.

802
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,470
The owner just talked about it once.

803
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,200
He didn't really want to transfer the shop.

804
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,620
You just said he wanted to transfer the shop.

805
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,880
Now you suddenly changed your mind.

806
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,320
What?

807
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,610
Did you change your mind because we are women?

808
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,590
Of course not.

809
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,480
Ladies.

810
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,290
Ladies,

811
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,940
it's not that we don't want to rent it to you.

812
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,030
We just...

813
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,660
We understand your concern.

814
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,420
Xinchuan has never had a precedent for women to do business.

815
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,350
But since we are both businessmen,

816
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,510
we should start from each other's interests.

817
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,130
Each other's interests?

818
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,050
Can you give our owner

819
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,120
more benefits than others?

820
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,460
We're not talking about this with your owner.

821
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,270
We are talking with you.

822
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,010
Me?

823
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,430
Talk to me?

824
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,680
Tuanyuan Restaurant is located in the main street.

825
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,540
The merchant who can get this shop

826
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,180
must have a strong foundation in the city.

827
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,040
He must know every shopkeeper in Xinchuan.

828
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,760
In that case,

829
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,850
he won't keep you here.

830
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,510
If Mr. Zhou can help us with this business,

831
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,750
I promise

832
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,880
as long as you want to stay,

833
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,260
we will not let you go.

834
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,990
I don't know much about you.

835
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,350
As you know, in Xinchuan,

836
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,620
there is no precedent for women to do business.

837
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,310
If the restaurant is not well managed

838
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,200
and it goes bankrupt...

839
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,640
Once it closes,

840
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,400
you have to find a new job.

841
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,240
But we can sign a pledge.

842
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,690
If the restaurant is not well managed,

843
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,380
when you go find another job,

844
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,960
we will definitely give you

845
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,250
half a year's salary.

846
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,480
Besides,

847
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,220
if you help us with the transfer of the shop,

848
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,750
you can get the commission.

849
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,600
No matter what,

850
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,820
you won't suffer losses.

851
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,540
I'm not afraid to tell you.

852
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,440
We want to run this restaurant

853
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,230
to make all cuisines in the nine regions.

854
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,890
It can attract local people with foreign dishes

855
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,060
and allow friends from other regions eat hometown food.

856
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,590
Xinchuan has people from different regions.

857
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,360
Many friends miss the taste of their hometown.

858
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,980
Mr. Zhou, judging from your accent,

859
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,810
you are not from here, right?

860
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,130
Yes.

861
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,080
You can't go home since you work outside.

862
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,140
It's good to have some hometown food.

863
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,330
We will also welcome female guests.

864
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,550
Xinchuan has no place to entertain women.

865
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,080
It is a big market.

866
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,190
Mr. Zhou,

867
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,640
you are experienced and knowledgeable.

868
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,390
You know the benefits.

869
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,200
Only if you dare to do it first can you taste the sweetness.

870
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,000
Got it.

871
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,890
[Zhuanyuan Restaurant]

872
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,690
We're here.

873
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,490
Should we just sit here like fools?

874
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,260
Only you're sitting here like a fool.

875
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,590
Fine, you're sitting here like a wise man.

876
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,870
Aren't we going in to help them?

877
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,050
They said they will do it on their own.

878
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,660
We need to learn to let go.

879
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,460
Believe them.

880
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,020
Believe? It's easy for you to say.

881
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,660
Do you believe them?

882
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,340
If you do, why did you come here?

883
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
I don't trust you.

884
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,300
I found that you started to care about Princess Shangguan.

885
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,280
Who cares about her?

886
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,750
I...

887
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,280
I was bored at home alone,

888
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,300
so I came out to relieve my boredom.

889
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,210
You...

890
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,640
I just miss her.

891
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,640
So what?

892
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,900
She is my wife.

893
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,510
I miss her.

894
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,080
It's right and proper that I miss her.

895
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,980
Fair and square.

896
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,730
No problem.

897
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,590
Don't you miss Li Wei?

898
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,300
They're out.

899
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,760
Let's go, Yuan Ying.

900
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:04,720
Come.

901
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,410
Be careful.

902
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,830
Here.

903
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,000
They look happy.

904
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,150
Things must have gone well.

905
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,070
Smile if you want.

906
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,080
Don't hold it in.

907
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,360
Don't pretend to be too understood to be profound.

908
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,090
Too profound to be understood.

909
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:22,710
Let's go home.
