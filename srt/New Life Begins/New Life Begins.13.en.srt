[Episode 13]

4
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,330
The document has been torn apart.

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,370
An apology can't make it restored.

6
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,539
But Li Wei

7
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,890
still has to read it.

8
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,030
So,

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,710
Miss Song,

10
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,060
you may need

11
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,420
to get the pieces

12
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,640
stuck together.

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,630
Since you nearly have no basic knowledge,

14
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,630
and are poor in it,

15
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,380
I'm afraid the training plan

16
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,690
will last long.

17
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,690
However,

18
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,329
you must not slack off.

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
I've written an example.

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
Please follow this example.

21
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,700
Actually, in Xinchuan, I...

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
Thank you, Princess.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,940
Not bad.

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Three points!

25
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,770
Go on.

26
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,970
Your Highness,

27
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,600
before the plan is completed,

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,810
please be diligent.

29
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,950
Don't just think about love.

30
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,950
What? I...

31
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,120
I-I-I'm looking for you.

32
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,200
I just thought of an idea

33
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,100
to pay back Jinchuan's debt.

34
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,660
If it's really like that,

35
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,160
then why are you standing here?

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,480
Hurry up and write a memorial.

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,750
Yes.

38
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,070
One wrong number.

39
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,829
Only one.

40
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,370
[Blessed with Yuan Ying's intelligence]

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,579
No one can get a full mark.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,900
Let me show you.

43
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,480
I've never made a mistake.

44
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,960
I admire you, Miss Yuan Ying.

45
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,760
Three locks.

46
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,570
I told you.

47
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,480
For your health,

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,390
late snacks are forbidden henceforth.

49
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,190
You must sleep before midnight.

50
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,500
Late snacks?

51
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,400
I don't need that.

52
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,780
It's for the dog.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,370
It's for Baifu,

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,440
so I came to have a look.

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,240
Late snacks are not allowed for anyone in the mansion,

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
and Baifu is no exception.

57
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,370
Go back to sleep.

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,170
Alright.

59
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,200
Jiang Yue, Lady of the Eldest Prince, is from Yingchuan.

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,560
She likes making soup because it's nutritious.

61
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
Zhao Fangru, Lady of the Second Prince, is from Daichuan.

62
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,640
She loves river snails rice noodle and stinky tofu.

63
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,600
Dong Haitang, Lady of the Third Prince, is from Cangchuan.

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,120
She got her name, for Cangchuan abounds with crabapples.

65
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,040
She has no need for any special diet.

66
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,040
An Xiyuan, Lady of the Fourth Prince, is from Mochuan.

67
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,090
She loves sweets.

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,670
You memorized it this time.

69
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,280
Princess,

70
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,100
I think it's better to let her recite it after meals.

71
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,960
Your Highness,

72
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,950
before moving out of the palace,

73
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,920
it's better for you not to breach the decorum.

74
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,540
I'm Li Wei's teacher now,

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,040
and your assistant.

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,370
I hope you can support me

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,930
in my decision.

78
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,160
Let's eat first.

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,360
Have you read recent years' materials regarding the economic exchanges

80
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,200
between Xinchuan and Jinchuan?

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,590
Yes.

82
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,990
Let's eat.

83
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,520
After you move out of the palace,

84
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,050
it'll be more convenient for me to come to you.

85
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,480
After moving here,

86
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,040
the main yard is for Princess Jinchuan, right?

87
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Where do you live?

88
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,670
I'll live in the Eastern Courtyard.

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,450
Did she bully you?

90
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,460
Yuan Ying...

91
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,990
is very strict with me.

92
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,700
But I know

93
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,270
it's all because that

94
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,840
she wanted to train me

95
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,050
and make me a good partner.

96
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,710
She hopes that I can have the ability

97
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,900
to manage the household affairs with her.

98
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,150
And she is sensible.

99
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,510
She is kinda

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,560
a good leader.

101
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,760
But it's hard for us

102
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,010
to find someone trustworthy

103
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,970
no matter for work or for marriage.

104
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,280
As concubines,

105
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,340
we'll anyhow suffer a little.

106
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,260
Just bear it.

107
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,160
Only by making the princes happy

108
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,690
can we live a peaceful life.

109
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,550
I still don't understand

110
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,450
why it's a must to make the princes happy.

111
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,360
Why can women in Xinchuan

112
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,230
only rely on their husbands

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,330
and live for pleasing their husbands?

114
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,200
If it were not for being confined in the courtyards by men,

115
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,730
women could also be able to make great achievements.

116
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,630
Like Yuan Ying,

117
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,920
she should have her own world.

118
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,150
How dare you eavesdrop on masters?

119
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,510
What kind of master is she?

120
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,530
She's talking behind my master's back.

121
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,130
You have no right to prevent me from eavesdropping.

122
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,920
Nonsense!

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,470
My master never gossips behind others' back.

124
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,760
If you have time,

125
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,740
why don't you go back and improve your level?

126
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,720
My lady is decisive

127
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,220
and as clever as Zhuge Liang.

128
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,290
Your master doesn't deserve to gossip about her.

129
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,820
You think you're good, huh?

130
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,590
Yuping!

131
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,590
Don't.

132
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,310
My Lady,

133
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,540
she badmouthed you.

134
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,710
How can you slander Lady Wei?

135
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,580
My master is the best lady in the world.

136
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,470
My master is the best.

137
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,670
My master is the best!

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,650
Enough.

139
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,040
You eavesdropped on others,

140
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,370
quarreled with others,

141
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,700
and even made a scene in front of the concubines.

142
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,430
Your Ladyship.

143
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,490
I know I was wrong.

144
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,440
But I really can't stand them talking behind your back.

145
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,100
What you did for protecting me

146
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,560
can be scarier than those smears targeting me.

147
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,890
You have your own tasks.

148
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,330
Besides,

149
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,620
you should also have your own life.

150
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,010
You can study more.

151
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,440
Don't put your minds

152
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,970
on the meaningless things.

153
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,830
I know I was wrong.

154
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,860
I know.

155
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,940
You did this

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,539
because you sincerely care about me.

157
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,070
But I originally never interfered with them.

158
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
After your messing with them,

159
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,960
it can be embarrassing for me to meet them.

160
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,039
And it'll be troublesome

161
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,400
for me to get along with them in the future.

162
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,170
In the future,

163
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,700
don't do such things again.

164
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,500
Yes, My Lady.

165
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,250
Don't cry.

166
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,050
Get up.

167
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's go apologize to Concubine Wei.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,260
Yes.

169
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,510
We should apologize.

170
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,920
I was wrong.

171
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,330
I shouldn't have eavesdropped on Concubine Wei

172
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,460
and fought with you.

173
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,910
I won't do it again.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,660
Never mind.

175
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,670
I was wrong too.

176
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,030
Princess did everything for my good.

177
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,990
I shouldn't have blamed her for being harsh.

178
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,920
I was also wrong.

179
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,840
Please punish me, Your Ladyship.

180
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,440
Forget it.

181
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,140
I've already criticized her.

182
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,890
You two,

183
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,730
don't do this again.

184
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,360
-Yes. -Yes.

185
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,480
My Lord.

186
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,350
There's only half a year left to the due date for payments to Jinchuan.

187
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,610
But we gave Danchuan three more years of repayment period.

188
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,210
It's really not easy to raise the money

189
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
for the payments to Jinchuan.

190
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,330
The Legitimate Eldest Prince.

191
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,030
I've made it clear.

192
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,770
Danchuan shouldn't be blamed

193
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,070
for the debts Xinchuan owes.

194
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,170
My Lord.

195
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,910
The Legitimate Eldest Prince

196
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,770
is not blaming Danchuan.

197
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,230
He's just thinking for Xinchuan's good

198
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,160
and worrying about the difficulty in raising money.

199
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,920
I ordered you to come up with a solution,

200
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,020
not to talk nonsense.

201
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,080
In other words,

202
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,310
even a three-year-old kid on the street

203
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,850
can do line drawing.

204
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,980
There's no need for you to gather here

205
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,210
having empty talks.

206
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,940
The Sixth Prince.

207
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,060
You haven't said a word since you came to the court.

208
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,320
Why don't you tell us your opinion?

209
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,210
Don't be afraid of being wrong.

210
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,850
Let me know what you think.

211
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,130
Yes.

212
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,030
My Lord,

213
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,630
I think

214
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,820
since we've promised Jinchuan to pay the debt by installment,

215
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,070
we should keep our promises

216
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,600
to establish our prestige.

217
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,360
You just married the princess of Jinchuan

218
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,020
and now you're already on the same side with her?

219
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,290
It has nothing to do with that.

220
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,980
I do have a suggestion.

221
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,810
We should encourage business.

222
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,290
Prince Zheng, how could you want Xinchuan to encourage business?

223
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,440
Please mind your words, Prince Zheng!

224
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,970
To prioritize businessmen over scholars will bring disaster.

225
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,060
Silence!

226
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,170
I didn't mean to prioritize businessmen over scholars.

227
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,510
But if the precinct-market system can be relaxed a little bit,

228
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,440
it can help us raise money in a shorter time.

229
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,170
Ridiculous!

230
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,400
Separating markets from precincts

231
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,280
has ensured the safety of the people.

232
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,490
Once the boundary is broken,

233
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,410
who can ensure

234
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,520
the social order within the city?

235
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,310
It can only benefit the merchants,

236
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,720
misleading people to go after money

237
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,180
while ignoring morality.

238
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,570
Isn't that just how Jinchuan is like?

239
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,730
Only putting profit first.

240
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,290
In my view,

241
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,200
to encourage business is just an adoptable method.

242
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,640
When relaxing the control over the market,

243
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,030
we should also educate the people

244
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,140
never to lose their backbone for vanity.

245
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,690
My Lord.

246
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,420
It seems that the Sixth Prince

247
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,080
has already thought of a plan.

248
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,150
Make it complete after you go back,

249
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,250
and write a memorial to me.

250
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes.

251
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,350
Miss Yuan Ying.

252
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,680
I'm really tired.

253
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,420
My back hurts and I feel dizzy.

254
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,160
I can't learn anymore.

255
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,360
To get some rest during learning

256
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,780
should be the proper way.

257
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,330
Don't even think about it.

258
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,100
Miss Yuan Ying.

259
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,060
I feel like being a top,

260
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,180
forced to spin ceaselessly.

261
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,910
Please.

262
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,490
Let me take a rest.

263
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,300
I want to go eat something.

264
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,700
You smiled.

265
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,620
So you agreed?

266
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,380
Wait.

267
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,700
Let me see the answers you just wrote.

268
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,330
Only five correct answers.

269
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,530
You can get five points.

270
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,640
Well,

271
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,500
have a rest.

272
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,880
Yuan Ying, you are so nice.

273
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,320
Have you told Lord your idea

274
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,380
in the court today?

275
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,710
Yes.

276
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,810
It must have been refuted by the Legitimate Eldest Prince and his men.

277
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,050
If my guess is right,

278
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,010
they targeted at you with your marrying Princess Jinchuan.

279
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,260
If this happens again,

280
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,610
you can say...

281
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,790
I'm capable

282
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,520
of handing these things.

283
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,240
Princess is more like my teacher than Mr. Dai now.

284
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,970
Since you've chosen to be my assistant,

285
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,260
then please try to trust your partner.

286
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,550
Actually, I think Li Wei is reliable.

287
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,540
Why don’t you reflect on yourself?

288
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,480
Have you ever thought about why I wouldn't trust you?

289
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,890
Please work hard

290
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,170
to become a qualified partner.

291
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,440
Yes.

292
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,040
I understand.

293
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,330
Your confidence

294
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,760
is really unbeatable.

295
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,580
Same to you.

296
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,860
How about we...

297
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,750
Your Highness,

298
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,120
please read the memorials before you go for dinner.

299
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,990
Don't delay it.

300
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,370
Yes.

301
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,010
Yuan Ying is meticulous.

302
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,720
I put Baifu's food pot in the pavilion.

303
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,750
When Yuan Ying passes by,

304
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,320
she will definitely take it back.

305
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,960
I've been training Baifu for three days.

306
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,680
It has learned how to protect its food.

307
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,040
As long as Yuan Ying passes by,

308
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,100
it will attack her.

309
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,160
She's coming.

310
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,040
Give it to me.

311
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,410
Baifu.

312
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,300
Here you go!

313
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,020
Miss.

314
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,440
Will Her Lady really get hurt?

315
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,920
So cute.

316
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,770
Baifu, you traitor!

317
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,530
Have you eaten too much lately?

318
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,370
Li Wei.

319
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,260
Stop it.

320
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,770
Your tricks won't work on her.

321
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,370
Let's go.

322
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,600
You just watch this person

323
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,700
occupy our family?

324
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,990
If things keep being like this,

325
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,710
she'll completely make dear Zheng belong to her

326
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,810
and kick us out.

327
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,650
She won't.

328
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,650
Yuan Ying...

329
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,710
She's not the kind of woman willing to be trapped in the backyard.

330
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,990
Are you hungry too?

331
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,350
You scared me.

332
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,300
You also scared me.

333
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,410
I thought it was Yuan Ying.

334
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,640
I searched everywhere.

335
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,880
There's nothing else left

336
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,610
except this.

337
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,550
I don't like steamed buns.

338
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,410
It's not tasty.

339
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,950
It tastes good if you add something.

340
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,470
Try it.

341
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,240
Is it good?

342
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,140
I knew it.

343
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,170
This is the only honey left.

344
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,810
I won't give it away if it's someone else.

345
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,720
Then why did you give it to me?

346
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,120
Don't flirt with me

347
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,930
in such a difficult time.

348
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,310
We are fellow sufferers.

349
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,060
I sympathize with you.

350
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,340
-Do you... -I think...

351
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,420
You go first.

352
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,000
You...

353
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,050
Do you still want to leave?

354
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,770
I've made up my mind.

355
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,640
In this place,

356
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,750
Yuan Ying is your legal wife.

357
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,520
Before she gets away,

358
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,140
let's stay out of each other's business.

359
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,370
For the future, we'll talk about it later.

360
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,270
If you're not full,

361
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,750
eat more.

362
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,590
You should eat more.

363
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,310
You should eat more, since you have stomach problems.

364
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,080
I'm already full, you can eat more.

365
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,830
Me too.

366
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,330
Has she left?

367
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,010
No.

368
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,650
She's coming.

369
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:45,950
Father.

370
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,270
Please let me go back to my mansion.

371
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,000
I promise I'll come to the palace every day

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,130
to greet you in the morning and at dusk.

373
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,990
Please don't detain me in the palace.

374
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,270
I know you.

375
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,600
You'll indulge in debauchery as soon as you leave the palace.

376
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,730
I've received countless memorials for impeaching you.

377
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,200
Father.

378
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,520
Xinchuan has been putting scholars, farmers before merchants over the past century.

379
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,600
The previous dynasties dared not break it to establish new policies.

380
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,060
Now the debts owed to Jinchuan has created a good opportunity.

381
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,000
If we can relax the precinct-market system,

382
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,330
it will help us raise money in a short time.

383
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,270
It's not hard to raise the money we owe to Jinchuan.

384
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,870
But now is the best time

385
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
to break the boundary between precincts and markets.

386
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,870
This is a great issue,

387
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,130
and can't be accomplished overnight.

388
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,960
It should be gradually relaxed

389
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,760
with imperceptible influence.

390
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,500
In your opinion,

391
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,460
what should we do first?

392
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,200
Remove the curfew and allow night markets.

393
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,340
From New Year's Eve,

394
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,700
there will be no curfew in Xinchuan anymore.

395
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,180
This first step

396
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,720
is not reckless.

397
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,670
The previous dynasties dared not open night markets

398
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,400
because it was hard to manage it during war time.

399
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,280
But now our country is in peace and prosperity,

400
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,040
and it's a good time to recruit talents to serve Xinchuan

401
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,280
and manage the economy.

402
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,680
Great!

403
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,890
I'll leave the night market business to you.

404
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,500
Be sure to carry it forward

405
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,570
step by step.

406
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,550
Don't rush it.

407
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,690
Thank you, Father.

408
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,870
I have another request.

409
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,120
An has a lot of business outside the palace.

410
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
If he can guide me,

411
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,700
things will be much easier for me.

412
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,120
That's right.

413
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,860
Father,

414
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,160
I want to leave the palace, for I also have important business to do.

415
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,860
-I promise I won't... -Fine.

416
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,940
Just let him help you.

417
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,500
Yes.

418
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,430
I will do my best.

419
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,530
From now on, I...

420
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,440
Fine.

421
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,520
I didn’t expect you to be so thoughtful.

422
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,370
Granduncle.

423
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,650
What did you call me?

424
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,000
Princess Yuan Ying is my grandaunt.

425
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,870
You know that.

426
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,010
So from now on,

427
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,320
we should separately follow the seniority.

428
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,270
I call you Granduncle.

429
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,400
You call me Brother.

430
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,690
Granduncle.

431
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,250
I’m going home.

432
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,060
As for visiting the precincts and markets, I'll leave it to you.

433
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,840
Everyone,

434
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,980
from now on,

435
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,540
we are free.

436
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,130
You've suffered in the palace.

437
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,830
But suffering makes us better.

438
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,350
Next, it'll be

439
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,450
"We've been through the clouds of blood and fire."

440
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,540
We've been through the clouds of blood and fire.

441
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,340
It was a journey of hardships.

442
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,930
To recall the past,

443
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,220
things have changed a lot over time.

444
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,000
He's gonna make an antithesis.

445
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,330
The next sentence will be

446
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,100
"We've been under the baptism of frost and snow."

447
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,960
We've been under the baptism of frost and snow.

448
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,650
It will be the start of a new journey.

449
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,910
To look at the present,

450
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,500
the way ahead is with great mission.

451
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,490
He's run out of words.

452
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,220
It's time for a summary speech.

453
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,960
The six of us

454
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,010
can finally reunite with the rest of our family.

455
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,200
It's always like that.

456
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,210
Idiot!

457
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,040
I've been thinking these days

458
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,690
whether you guys

459
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,780
feel a little lonely?

460
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,710
Does he mean...

461
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,230
No way.

462
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,000
So I decided

463
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,020
to bring more girls home to be your friends.

464
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,230
What do you think?

465
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,240
We want to bring you a coffin!

466
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,440
Your Highness.

467
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,300
Look.

468
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,520
How's your business?

469
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,650
Does it look good?

470
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,160
I didn't expect Prince Zheng can be so thoughtful.

471
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,240
He knows you're bored,

472
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,000
so he takes this surveying opportunity

473
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,240
to take you out of the palace.

474
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,600
He himself also wants to play.

475
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,130
Boss.

476
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,400
How's your business?

477
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,290
Thanks to you,

478
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,920
it's good.

479
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,670
Not bad.

480
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,630
Good luck with your business.

481
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,430
Are you still not happy with him?

482
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,840
It was Lord Xinchuan who granted the marriage.

483
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,780
It was not up to Prince Zheng.

484
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,560
Besides, Princess Yuan Ying said

485
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,090
this marriage is not valid.

486
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,630
I'm not unhappy with him.

487
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,360
I just have the feeling of being helpless.

488
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,280
No one is wrong in this.

489
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,280
It's Xinchuan's bullshit rule that is wrong.

490
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,800
Our Jichuan is much better.

491
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,210
Boss.

492
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,730
How's your business?

493
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,530
Not bad.

494
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,790
If there will be night markets,

495
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,920
will you still come out?

496
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,300
Yes.

497
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,140
Of course.

498
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,560
Okay.

499
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,920
Good luck with your business.

500
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,520
Take care.

501
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,750
This mask is interesting.

502
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,750
Miss, take a look.

503
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,690
How much is this?

504
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,600
I just smelled a stink of copper,

505
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,840
wondering who he is.

506
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,590
Brother.

507
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,140
I heard that you were planning to make An help you

508
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,240
remove the curfew.

509
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,260
How dare you break

510
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,580
the rules established by our ancestors?

511
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,260
I dare not.

512
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,590
I'm just following orders.

513
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,050
How dare you!

514
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,410
Now, you even dare refute me by Father's name?

515
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,740
You just married a princess of Jinchuan.

516
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,120
Do you really think you are a great man?

517
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,540
Who's a great man

518
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,540
depends on who can really help the people.

519
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,600
What does it have to do with marriage?

520
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,030
A man with Lord's will in mind

521
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,070
can also make great achievements

522
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,690
even being low-born.

523
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,390
Your Highness,

524
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,490
I am inexperienced.

525
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,000
I think you won't bother yourself arguing with me.

526
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,010
Zheng.

527
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,280
I have no interest in disciplining your woman.

528
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,480
But if something goes wrong with revitalizing business,

529
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,040
you may need to think about how to get punished.

530
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,040
Let's go.

531
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,960
My Lady,

532
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,630
-Cool! -Cool!

533
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,960
You've got some nerve, huh!

534
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,080
Even having the courage to challenge the Legitimate Eldest Prince!

535
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,960
He bullied you.

536
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,180
Luckily, Miss Yuan Ying let me read many books.

537
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to say such literary words.

538
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,840
You're much better than him.

539
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,640
I support you.

540
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,530
Fresh crabs.

541
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,930
Do you want some?

542
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,490
Let's go.

543
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,060
Yuping.

544
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,920
Take this back to the mansion.

545
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
Get a carriage to pick us up later.

546
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,530
Okay?

547
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,270
Okay.

548
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,130
Thank you.

549
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,610
OK.

550
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,230
Big crabs.

551
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,500
We're home so soon.

552
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,540
How about we

553
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,010
go have a drink?

554
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,320
Sure.

555
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,080
No, you can't drink.

556
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,980
In fact, Miss Yuan Ying is not that scary.

557
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,800
Her being strict is for our own good.

558
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,200
Right.

559
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,640
Capable disciples are always those trained by strict teachers.

560
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,510
I understand, but I still want to sit her for a little longer.

561
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,040
Let's wait a little longer.

562
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:26,840
No need.

563
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,040
I like dealing with crabs by myself.

564
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,170
Give it to Yuan Ying.

565
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,980
These are the crabs we bought in the market today.

566
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,160
Crabs are rarely available during spring,

567
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,220
especially such fatty female crabs.

568
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,730
Try it.

569
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,360
Is it good?

570
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,840
Jinchuan is alongside the ocean.

571
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,110
You used to eat crabs a lot, right?

572
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,660
Indeed.

573
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,240
I used to eat crabs when I was young.

574
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,140
I was young at that time,

575
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,030
and always felt unsatisfied no matter how many I've eaten.

576
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,630
My father and mother knew it.

577
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,820
So they gave all the crabs to me.

578
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,240
They are always strict with me.

579
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,570
Only over little things like eating crabs

580
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,840
would they be soft-hearted and grant me permission.

581
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:33,650
Yuan Ying.

582
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,470
However,

583
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,250
crabs are cold in nature.

584
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,310
Don't eat too much.

585
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,150
You can only eat half, Your Highness.

586
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,360
Otherwise, you will have a relapse of stomach problems.

587
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:43,840
Yes.

588
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,560
Let me eat the rest for you.

589
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,040
You can't eat too much, either.

590
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,370
You always eat too much.

591
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,000
If you are too indulgent,

592
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,790
it'll be easy for others to know your favorites.

593
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,440
It's not good.

594
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,150
Should I...

595
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,780
What do you think, Miss Song?

596
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,890
Food is just for filling the stomach.

597
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,890
Only by restraining the greed

598
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,480
can you have stronger will.

599
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,180
Just a few crabs.

600
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,940
You like them too.

601
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,350
Just eat as much as you want for once.

602
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,560
It's okay, right?

603
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,500
Don't repress yourself so hard.

604
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,960
It's not about a few crabs.

605
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,340
It's about self-control.

606
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,030
I'm full.

607
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,270
Enjoy your meal.

608
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,740
[Simple and unworldly]

609
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,790
Your handwriting is getting better.

610
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,090
Greetings, Father.

611
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,630
Rise.

612
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,190
How's everything going in your mansion?

613
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,520
How are you doing with Princess Yuan Ying?

614
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,040
Thanks for your caring, Father.

615
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,170
Everything is fine.

616
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,940
I know you care about Concubine Wei from Jichuan.

617
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,630
But she's low-born and won't be helpful to you.

618
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,230
Since last year's Danchuan issue,

619
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,940
I've been counting on you.

620
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,219
In the future, you'll surely be a major minister helpful to the court.

621
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:31,969
So,

622
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,760
a capable wife

623
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,929
can help you a lot.

624
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:37,940
Yes.

625
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,600
Except for your Second Brother,

626
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,949
I've never attended anyone else's banquet for moving into their own mansions.

627
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,670
So, I can't either be partial to you.

628
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,610
Take this painting

629
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,310
as my gift for your moving

630
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,840
into your own mansion.

631
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,830
Thank you, Father.

632
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,430
By the way, one more thing.

633
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,570
Your Fifth Brother has reached the age.

634
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,470
And your Seventh Brother has been diligent since young.

635
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,580
I plan to grant them their mansions next month.

636
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,200
You should always help them.

637
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,720
This should also be the most important business of you.

638
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,120
Yes.

639
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,220
He's just an illegitimate child, ranking sixth.

640
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,220
How dare he dip his finger into my Ministry of Revenue?

641
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,750
He's just using the excuse of repaying Jinchuan's debt

642
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,880
to ask Father to give him the proposal.

643
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,670
[Invitation to the banquet in Garden of Tranquility]

644
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:38,140
Brother, are you going to Zheng's banquet for his moving into his own mansion?

645
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,980
Does he deserve it?

646
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,440
Right.

647
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,270
It's just an illegitimate son's banquet.

648
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,070
He's not worthy of having the Legitimate Eldest Prince as his guest.

649
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,890
Brother.

650
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,460
I'm afraid Zheng will drum up support on his banquet

651
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,690
to run night markets together.

652
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,060
Spread the news

653
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,470
that I won't attend his banquet.

654
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,040
If the Legitimate Eldest Prince doesn't go,

655
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,300
no one will dare to step into his mansion.

656
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,220
Otherwise,

657
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,450
it'll be going against you.

658
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:26,870
Remember,

659
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,150
you must arrange seats

660
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,600
according to the order on the list.

661
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,500
No mistake is allowed.

662
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,360
-Yes. -Yes.

663
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,610
So many people are invited!

664
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,160
This is the latest guest list.

665
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,350
There are four tables in total.

666
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,040
Just arrange them in this room.

667
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Two for all princes and their wives.

668
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,810
And the other two for womenfolk of officials from all ministries.

669
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,280
You must be familiar with the process

670
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,540
and the guests' seats.

671
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,270
You can invite the womenfolk to enjoy the flowers in the garden.

672
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,360
I'm good at that.

673
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,160

Tell your men

676

to guard the mansion during the banquet,

677
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,360
especially the area between the front yard and the backyard.

678
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,940
If anyone gets drunk and trespasses,

679
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,350
just give him two bowls of sober-up soup

680
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,280
and let him sleep it off.

681
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,120
Okay.

682
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,210
Now,

683
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,470
you can set off firecrackers now.

00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,110
Don't worry, Princess.

686
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,080
Put them away.

687
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,520
Go set off firecrackers!

691
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,290
Yes.

692
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:29,820
Good.

693
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,610
Write down everything I said

694
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,730
and do as I said.

695
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,170
When you become a legal wife later,

696
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,420
and need to hold a family banquet,

697
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,070
you won't have to be in a mess.

698
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,160
Thank you, Miss Yuan Ying.

699
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,650

Okay.

707

To work together with one heart! Good words!

716

Don't put the chairs too far.

717
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,160
Or it won't be convenient for the guests to talk.

718
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,300
Nor too close.

719
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,600
Otherwise, it'll be hard for customers to walk around.

720
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,160
Yes.

721
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,680

739
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,100
I'll go check the kitchen.

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,800
you're the head chef now.

753
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,350
You don't have to do everything yourself.

754
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,750
Just leave such little things to the cooks.

755
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,240
Xiaoqi.

756
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,600
Here.

757
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,860
Help me stir-fry it.

758
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,310
Okay.

759
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,070
Master.

760
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,650
Chef Liu.

761
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,190
Can we cook the edible amaranth?

762
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,820
Amaranth?

763
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,480
It was originally lettuce ordered on the list.

764
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,350
But we don't have enough of it now.

765
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,810
Her Ladyship said we can change it to lettuce.

766
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,320
Fine.

767
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,160
As long as Her Ladyship agrees.

768
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,150
Go prepare the dishes.

769
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,950
Master, look.

770
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,850
It's nutritious turtle soup.

771
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,600
It was bought early in this morning.

772
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,240
Very fresh.

773
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,040
Nothing can be more nutritious.

774
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,850
Not bad.

775
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,010
Everyone, busy now?

776
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,760
Thank you for your hard work!

777
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,530
Butler Su.

778
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,570
Baoquan,

779
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,920
the banquet is very important.

780
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,200
The guests will be here soon.

781
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,080
Be sure not to make any mistake here in the kitchen.

782
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,720
Don't worry.

783
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,210
Our kitchen will make it.

784
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,600
Really?

785
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:05,890
Yes.

786
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,640
Come here, look!

787
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,240
Great.

788
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,290
Hurry up.

789
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,050
Hurry up.

790
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,920
Go back to work.

791
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,310
It's been so long.

792
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,240
Why isn't anyone here yet?

793
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,830
Brother has a complicated relationship.

794
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:29,890
If he refuses to come,

795
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,150
who else dares to come?

796
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,550
Even so,

797
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,640
why aren't the other princes and ladies here yet?

798
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,800
Don't you always hang out with them?

799
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,430
I thought you were close.

800
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,050
It seems that it's nothing.

801
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,870
Maybe they're still on the way here.

802
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,910
Let's wait.

803
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,250
We can go out now!

804
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,370
The sunshine is so nice.

805
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,490
Do I look good with my makeup today?

806
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,250
Where are you going?

807
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,050
Where are you going?

808
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,800
Although my grandaunt

809
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,600
sent an invitation personally,

810
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,410
Brother clearly refused to go,

811
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,840
and as a vital member of the Ministry of Revenue,

812
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,790
I absolutely can't go.

813
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,020
It doesn't matter.

814
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,720
We're not members of the Ministry of Revenue.

815
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,690
Why can't we go?

816
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,570
You're wrong.

817
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,930
I work for the Ministry of Revenue.

818
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,930
You are my people.

819
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,620
So,

820
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,990
you can't go either.

821
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,370
I really want him to take some medicine.

822
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,800
Didn't he go to work?

823
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,390
Why is he back now?

824
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,890
Almost.

825
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,230
Otherwise, we already have left.

826
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,100
It's not easy for us to go out.

827
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,570
Will it go down the drain?

828
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,690
Then my makeup will be wasted.

829
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,570
I know.

830
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:44,850
You guys

831
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
want to have a party with the ladies.

832
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,370
I also want to go

833
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,320
for the sake of Princess Yuan Ying.

834
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,220
But Brother has made his statement.

835
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,290
I have no choice.

836
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:55,830
Coward!

837
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,280
Coward!

838
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,200
You scared me.

839
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,680
Hey.

840
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,500
You'd better veil yourself.

841
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,900
Brother is really scary.

842
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,220
Don't throw it away.

843
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,760
Sometimes I really don't want to hit you.

844
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,040
But sometimes I really can't stand it.

845
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Even if you hit me,

846
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,320
I have to consider your safety.

847
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,560
If Brother really murders you later,

848
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,820
I have to fight for you.

849
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,880
Of course.

850
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,200
It's not a big deal to fight for you.

851
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
I just don't want you to get injured.

852
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,690
You need to stay away from trouble.

853
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,690
Don't go.

854
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,530
But Wei has been very friendly to me.

855
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,860
I should go.

856
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,890
You can't go alone.

857
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,670
There are so many people.

858
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,070
You're not able to manage the social engagement alone.

859
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,060
How about

860
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,180
we don't go?

861
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,360
We can just send them a gift to express our gratitude.

862
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
What do you think?

863
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,680
No one went to Zheng's banquet, right?

864
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,800
Of course.

865
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,010
In the court,

866
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,160
who dares to disobey you?

867
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,530
I'd like to see

868
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,570
how well his own banquet can be held!

869
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,860
♫Longing for softness♫

870
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,390
♫Harvesting what was planted♫

871
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:48,680

♫Gone in a twinkling♫

♫With being a moth, flying to the flames♫

882
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:35,700
