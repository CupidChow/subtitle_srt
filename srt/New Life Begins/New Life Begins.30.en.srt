Let's get an amicable divorce.

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,550
What did you just say?

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,660
Amicable divorce.

7
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,530
Look.

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
You don't like me.

9
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,160
Neither do I like...

10
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,010
Right?

11
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,840
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

12
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,090

13

It's better for both of us.

No way.

Why do you seem unwilling?

21

Don't you dislike me the most?

No way you like me now, do you?

And over here.

29
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,160
Is this what you call "doing well"? There's nothing here.

We only got together because of the arranged marriage.

Now that I'm no longer a prince,

34
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,640
it's meaningless.

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,740
The arranged marriage has no meaning now.

Since you insist on asking, I'll tell you.

There's someone else that I like.

Hao Jia has broken up with Brother.

I'm not good at restaurant management,

If it wasn't her, who else could it be?

Shangguan is not a person who only cares about herself.

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,650
At such a critical moment,

Well, it actually can make a difference.

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,250
but he let you down,

191
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,170
I will ask someone to kill him.

192
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:55,710
No.

193
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,530
I don't, Sis.

194
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,110
How is that possible?

195
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,420
Not at all.

196
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,840
Not possible even in the next life.

197
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,360
Jing.

198
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,690
You're afraid I'll take revenge on him,

199
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,140
right?

200
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,810
I know what you're thinking.

201
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,460
I'm not.

202
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:25,990
Forget it.

203
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,400
I'll ask someone to find you some matrilocal husbands

204
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,200
and put an end to this ill-fated relationship.

205
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,510
No.

206
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,730
I don't need that.

207
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,700
You'll have to sleep in the guest room

208
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,070
for the next few days, Qi.

209
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,270
I won't say thank you for now.

210
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,170
I can live anywhere.

211
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,050
I'm all by myself now.

212
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,160
It's okay.

213
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,850
I'm incompetent.

214
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm sorry, Qi.

215
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,360
In the future, I'll definitely...

216
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
Why are you saying this?

217
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,230
Sit down.

218
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,020
Isn't it natural

219
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,770
to protect my younger brother?

220
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,160
Besides,

221
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,060
I think the result is not bad.

222
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,490
At least I saved you.

223
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,050
Right?

224
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,820
I think I did quite a good job.

225
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,960
You also defeated the initiator.

226
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,170
Take it as your revenge for me.

227
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,180
I'll help you after Father stops being mad at you.

228
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,780
Forget it.

229
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,160
Father won't take back

230
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,730
his order.

231
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,990
You're quite good at being an imperial official.

232
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,450
You've been doing it well.

233
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,620
While I

234
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,030
have no ambitions.

235
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,930
I'm not suitable for the imperial court in the first place.

236
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,260
I'm happy that I'm free now.

237
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,070
The officialdom

238
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:13,960
is so boring.

239
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,030
You want to become colleagues,

240
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,150
but I only want us to remain brothers.

241
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,130
You may look carefree,

242
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,970
but actually you are the one who's thought it through.

243
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,130
I've sent a letter to Lord Danchuan

244
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,730
to explain why you wanted an amicable divorce.

245
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,990
This is her reply.

246
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,150
[Only Prince Zheng shall open the envelop]

247
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,180
Forget it.

248
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,600
What's the point of this after what happened?

249
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,810
They must be cursing me in the letter.

250
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,410
An.

251
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,960
What's the rush?

252
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,560
He wasn't like this when he came.

253
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,200
Now...

254
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,240
Take a look.

255
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,060
This...

256
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,980
It's been three days.

257
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
He hasn't taken a bite or a sip at all.

258
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,950
Why are you standing in the corner?

259
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,130
Why are you crying?

260
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,900
I didn't expect them to really scold me.

261
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,000
They said I'm worse than pigs or dogs.

262
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,810
It's not a big deal.

263
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,740
Life is so hard.

264
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,650
I can't figure it out.

265
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,080
Don't try if you can't.

266
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,450
Qi.

267
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,550
It's not that bad.

268
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,510
It's just a wife.

269
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,890
All my wives ran away.

270
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,890
You just lost one.

271
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,930
It's not a big problem.

272
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,740
Compared to my experience,

273
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,340
it pales.

274
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,330
Come on. Go have dinner with me.

275
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,080
No.

276
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,140
Back when the palace called for a budget restraint,

277
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,780
this is how Jing stood in the corner.

278
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,090
Now that she's enlightened,

279
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,610
I failed her.

280
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,680
You only failed the meal.

281
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,210
Let's go.

282
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,720
Don't badmouth our relationship.

283
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,250
Let's go.

284
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,210
Our relationship is much more important than a meal.

285
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,250
I want Jing.

286
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,440
Isn't our relationship more important than food?

287
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,230
Jing.

288
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,590
Jing.

289
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,210
Jing.

290
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,300
I don't want to eat.

291
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,830
I don't want to eat.

292
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,670
Here, Qi.

293
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,520
Sweet and sour lotus root.

294
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,180
You like it.

295
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:02,990
Come on.

296
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,440
Try it.

297
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,960
Sweet and sour mandarin fish.

298
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,030
Sweet and sour chicken.

299
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,040
Sweet and sour spareribs.

300
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,370
These are all your favorite sweet dishes.

301
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,890
Try it.

302
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,530
Try it.

303
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,440
Coming.

304
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,140
Sweet and sour pork chops.

305
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,080
I want sweet and sour chili.

306
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,460
If you have chilies, give me some.

307
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:23,990
Well...

308
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,850
Which dish needs chili?

309
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,530
My heart needs it.

310
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,210
Hurry up.

311
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,330
But, Your Highness,

312
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,480
putting chili in will be humiliating my work.

313
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,230
What work?

314
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,620
I...

315
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,190
Come on.

316
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,060
My brother.

317
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,680
I have a stomachache just looking at it.

318
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,280
It's fine.

319
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,660
Qi has a strong stomach.

320
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,560
The chili can heal a broken heart.

321
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,630
Fight fire with fire.

322
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,890
You'll be better soon.

323
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,730
It's not spicy at all.

324
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,300
Not as spicy as Shangguan Jing's chilies.

325
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,110
It doesn't taste good at all.

326
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm done eating.

327
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:05,800
Oh no.

328
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,839
It's hopeless.

329
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,700
Your Highness.

330
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,040
Your Highness.

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,859
Your Highness.

332
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,670
Her Ladyship just got the news.

333
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,500
Prince Qi,

334
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,270
you really need to go to Danchuan.

335
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,099
I'm not going.

336
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,730
Respect.

337
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,880
Your temperament is so strong.

338
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,210
How about taking a look at this first?

339
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,859
There's nothing on it.

340
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,520
According to the order of Madam Danchuan,

341
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,650
My sister Jing, Princess Danchuan...

342
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,780
She'll select matrilocal husbands.

343
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,440
Shangguan Jing is having matrilocal husbands?

344
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,820
[Danchuan borders]

345
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,740
[Danchuan Teahouse]

346
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,810
How dare that heart-breaker!

347
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,360
Sir.

348
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,090
Sir, what would you like to eat?

349
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,220
Here, hold the horse for me.

350
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,670
Let me.

351
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,690
Is the opponent sent by our rivals

352
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,880
or from Xinchuan?

353
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,200
He doesn't look handsome in the picture.

354
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,930
He must be a bad guy.

355
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:07,740
Look.

356
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,580
So sanctimonious.

357
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,490
And shameless.

358
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,070
That's why

359
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,040
even if someone looks like a decent man, it doesn't mean he's really one.

360
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,570
Exactly.

361
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,660
How can a human do that kind of thing?

362
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,610
Yin Qi from Xinchuan

363
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,540
is my ex-husband who abandoned me.

364
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,180
He mistreated me.

365
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,890
He's the most unfaithful man in the world.

366
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,560
It means she loves me.

367
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,170
She's making it public to the world that

368
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,680
she still loves me.

369
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,630
Kill him!

370
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,860
Jing.

371
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,280
Hit him. Over there.

372
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,840
Shangguan.

373
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,930
Shangguan.

374
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,210
Who are you?

375
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm Yin Qi.

376
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,590
I want to see Princess Danchuan, Shangguan Jing.

377
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,340
It's you.

378
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,300
Please leave.

379
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,280
If you don't leave, we'll do what we have to.

380
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,610
I can't leave.

381
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,450
Please inform her.

382
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,670
Unless she refuses to see me herself...

383
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,970
But both Her Highness and Her Majesty have said that

384
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,920
they would never see you.

385
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,650
Get lost.

386
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,460
Fine.

387
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,480
Since she said she wouldn't see me,

388
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,890
I...

389
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,510
I...

390
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,090
I'll...

391
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,010
I'll wait for her here.

392
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,170
Don't...

393
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,870
Don't worry.

394
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,390
I won't disturb you.

395
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,200
If she doesn't come to see me in one day, I'll kneel for one day.

396
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,740
If she doesn't come in two days, I'll kneel for two days.

397
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,640
If she doesn't come no matter what,

398
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,040
I'll keep kneeling here.

399
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,760
Your Majesty.

400
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,860
Yin Qi is here in Danchuan.

401
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,390
He's at the palace gate, saying he wants to see Her Highness.

402
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,790
How dare he come?

403
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,930
The guards didn't want to report,

404
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,990
but he kept kneeling

405
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,580
at the gate for hours.

406
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,800
They got kind of soft-hearted.

407
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,420
I'll order someone to chase him away.

408
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:50,880
Wait.

409
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,040
Just let him kneel.

410
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,890
He deserves to

411
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,730
suffer for a while longer.

412
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,480
Yes.

413
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,370
Tomorrow at the selection of matrilocal husbands,

414
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,430
pick some good ones

415
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,680
and bring them in from outside the palace.

416
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,410
Right in front of Yin Qi's eyes.

417
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,590
Do you

418
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,450
still want to give him a chance?

419
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,950
He doesn't deserve it.

420
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,930
But Jing

421
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,240
should give herself a chance

422
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,010
to hear what he has to say.

423
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,150
Jing will make up her mind

424
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,390
if she'll kill him.

425
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,090
I'll only hand her the knife.

426
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,810
I'll take this then.

427
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,410
We'll buy the rest next time.

428
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,830
Sir,

429
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,560
what do you want?

430
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,460
You look quite handsome in this outfit.

431
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,870
Here's your plum wine.

432
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,090
Come on.

433
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,850
Try it.

434
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,450
I don't eat things from the night market.

435
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,710
This is the new dish of Nine Regions Food Collection.

436
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,950
Spicy beancurd and pickled bamboo shoot buns.

437
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,210
Pickled bamboo shoot?

438
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,990
Is it good?

439
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,670
Yes.

440
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,350
Here.

441
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,610
Have some plum wine with it.

442
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,630
That man,

443
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,480
you know who,

444
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,350
didn't want to visit you and your child at all.

445
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,070
I thought you may not want to see him either.

446
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,200
So I didn't try to talk to him.

447
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,960
Don't let him come.

448
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,300
If he comes,

449
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,210
my eyes may suppurate or sore.

450
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,320
You're really something now.

451
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,870
I guess you've been

452
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,350
holding back before.

453
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,080
Yes.

454
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,230
He doesn't deserve to be put up with anymore.

455
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,420
But to be honest,

456
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,080
I can't bear him

457
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,870
no matter how I look at him.

458
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,790
I was wondering

459
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,950
why I loved him so much in the past.

460
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,530
You did.

461
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,390
I've never liked him.

462
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,210
I've only liked his position.

463
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,530
But who could have known that

464
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,530
he was even more scheming than me.

465
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,120
So we

466
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,030
can only be our own boss.

467
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,070
That makes sense.

468
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:34,980
By the way,

469
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,090
as for your child,

470
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,820
do you want me

471
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,880
to rent a place outside

472
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,470
and take care of her with you?

473
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,930
No need.

474
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,160
Her godparents are both good people.

475
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,220
When I'm busy,

476
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,750
I'll trust them with her.

477
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:49,930
Godfather?

478
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,780
You mean Zheng?

479
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,550
Isn't he the uncle of the child?

480
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,910
If he doesn't have a father, how could he have an uncle?

481
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:04,930
Brilliant.

482
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,330
Come on.

483
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,580
Cheers.

484
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,010
You guys are too noisy.

485
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,900
Don't...

486
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,570
Little tiger.

487
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,000
Look at the little tiger.

488
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,570
Little tiger.

489
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,410
Don't cry.

490
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,170
We've fed her milk

491
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,040
and changed her diaper.

492
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,310
Why is she still crying?

493
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,210
Yeah.

494
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,570
Don't cry, my precious.

495
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,740
Please.

496
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,120
Little tiger.

497
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,550
Your Highness.

498
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,960
Your Highness.

499
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,990
Your Highness.

500
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,010
It's my fault.

501
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,350
I'm not good at lulling kids.

502
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,150
Sorry for having disturbed you.

503
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,900
She stopped crying.

504
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,010
Yes.

505
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,540
As expected of our Prince Zheng.

506
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,110
Such a talented man.

507
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,790
No matter it's an 80-year-old

508
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,910
or a new-born baby,

509
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,680
as long as you try,

510
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,340
there's nothing you can't do.

511
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,710
Yuping, Yuzhan.

512
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,590
Go tidy up the study.

513
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,370
Okay.

514
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,930
So heartwarming.

515
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,420
Good.

516
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,080
Good girl, Changle.

517
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,070
How did you do it?

518
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,450
According to the medical book,

519
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,900
the baby will have a stomachache after eating at night.

520
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,020
Its anecdotal name is pig-hair breeze.

521
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,360
Just give her a massage and she'll feel better.

522
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,290
My Prince Zheng is really amazing.

523
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,830
No matter it's an 80-year-old

524
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,060
or a new-born baby,

525
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,610
as long as you try, there's nothing you can't handle...

526
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,240
What? You are not open to praise?

527
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,780
She doesn't look like Song at all.

528
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,930
She's so pretty.

529
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,830
Changing shifts.

530
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,580
I told you.

531
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,690
Her Highness won't see you.

532
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,630
Just leave.

533
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,400
I'm not leaving.

534
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,160
I'll wait for her here

535
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,590
until she listens to my apology.

536
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,470
They are all here to participate in the selection of Princess's matrilocal husbands.

537
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,270
Open the gate.

538
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,140
Wait.

539
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,800
I want to compete too.

540
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,780
What did you say?

541
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,240
Shangguan wants a matrilocal husband.

542
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,840
I'll join the selection.

543
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm determined to

544
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,150
be her matrilocal husband.

545
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,420
We will select from you

546
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,770
the most suitable person to marry into Danchuan Palace.

547
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,810
There are three rounds in total.

548
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:27,860
Round One.

549
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,370
As we all know,

550
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,440
Her Highness likes spicy food.

551
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,920
In the burning time of one joss stick,

552
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,310
the one who eats the most ox aorta, fish eyes, and goose intestines

553
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,840
wins.

554
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,630
Everyone,

555
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,050
please begin.

556
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,400
This pot is extremely spicy.

557
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,040
Don't think you can handle it

558
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
just because you're from Danchuan.

559
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
When did you start

560
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,050
eating spicy food?

561
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,050
In Xinchuan,

562
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,610
when I was with Shangguan,

563
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,440
I gradually got the joy of eating spicy food.

564
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:56,950
Maybe

565
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,200
the pain brought by the chilies

566
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,250
is far less unbearable than losing her.

567
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,230
Her Highness likes using a spear.

568
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,760
This round

569
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,640
is to see whether you are qualified to be her training partner.

570
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,700
You can choose your own weapon now.

571
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,860
You go first.

572
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,430
Next.

573
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Next.

574
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,040
It's your turn.

575
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,670
You won't take any weapon?

576
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,820
Have you given it enough thought?

577
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,050
Cut the crap.

578
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,180
Let's begin.

579
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,330
When did you become so good?

580
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Shangguan used to beat me every day.

581
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,430
This is nothing.

582
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,460
The last round

583
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,500
is to pick a gift

584
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,980
for Her Highness

585
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,350
to make her happy.

586
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,540
The one who makes her the happiest

587
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,160
wins.

588
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,540
Sis.

589
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,380
I don't need a matrilocal husband.

590
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Didn't we talk about this last time?

591
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:44,980
You promised me

592
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,510
you would let me do whatever I want to do.

593
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,230
Why did you hold this kind of competition again?

594
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,570
I know you don't need it.

595
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,820
But what if

596
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,420
you want a companion in the future?

597
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,710
Maybe there won't be a suitable man of the right age

598
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,000
by that time.

599
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,710
I'll select some for you first.

600
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,520
Just in case.

601
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,820
Sis.

602
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,150
Alright, listen to me.

603
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,730
Your Majesty.

604
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,570
Your Highness.

605
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,270
The matrilocal husband competition is over.

606
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,270
Here are the answers they handed in.

607
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,590
[Sincerity]

608
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,760
I didn't tell you.

609
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,850
This fool is in Danchuan.

610
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,900
You said he wouldn't come,

611
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,179
but he came to see you.

612
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,070
It's up to you

613
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,659
whether you'll see him or not.

614
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,150
The result of this matrilocal competition is

615
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,160
no one is selected.

616
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,180
Please go to the palace gate and receive 50 taels each,

617
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,910
and go home.

618
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,670
50 taels?

619
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,290
50 taels!

620
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,020
What are we waiting for?

621
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,000
Let's go home. Get the money.

622
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,720
Let's go.

623
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,010
Let me see her.

624
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,030
Even if I don't deserve to be her matrilocal husband,

625
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,370
I just want to see her.

626
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,010
How dare you?

627
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:22,720
Drag him out.

628
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,150
No.

629
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,130
Don't chase me away.

630
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,250
I just want to see her.

631
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,120
I want to apologize to her face to face.

632
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,720
If she doesn't forgive me, I'll leave right away.

633
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,320
OK?

634
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,130
I beg you.

635
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,830
I'll accept any punishment.

636
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,780
I just want a chance to meet her.

637
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,020
I want to apologize to her face to face.

638
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,150
Let go of me.

639
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:40,760
Let go of me.

640
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,070
Let him go.

641
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,490
Her Highness is not in Danchuan now.

642
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,950
Her Majesty allowed her to travel around.

643
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,550
Where did she go?

644
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,930
In Danchuan,

645
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,770
if a man loses his virtue, he will be whipped.

646
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,710
If you can bear 100 whips...

647
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,230
Do it.

648
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,330
Bring the whip here now.

649
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,340
Not to mention beating me,

650
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,470
even if you have to stab me with a knife,

651
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,380
as long as you tell me where she is,

652
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,780
I'll be at your disposal.

653
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,880
Her Highness sent a letter from Danxia Lake Post yesterday.

654
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,590
Danxia Lake Post.

655
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,240
Thank you.

656
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,110
I can't thank you enough.

657
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,840
Danxia Lake.

658
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,080
Danxia Lake.

659
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,180
Danxia Lake.

660
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,700
I summoned you here today

661
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,510
for the matter of the Ministry of Revenue.

662
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,580
The Ministry of Revenue should be handed over to one of the other princes.

663
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,250
All of you can recommend candidates.

664
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,130
In my opinion,

665
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,190
Prince Zheng did a great job

666
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,190
in market improvement,

667
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,610
new currency promotion,

668
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,720
and the case of cracking counterfeit money.

669
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,930
He should take over.

670
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,610
I agree.

671
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,350
I also think Prince Zheng is the most suitable candidate.

672
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,350
I agree.

673
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,990
What do you think yourself, Prince Zheng?

674
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,060
My Lord.

675
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,560
It's not easy for me to manage the the Nine Regions Affairs Division.

676
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,520
I shouldn't take another position.

677
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,310
I think

678
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,070
the most suitable candidate should be Prince An.

679
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,940
He has been in the Ministry of Revenue for many years.

680
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,400
He knows how to operate it.

681
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,930
As the associate assistant, he's made great achievements too.

682
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,260
If he becomes the chief,

683
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,870
he'll fully deserve it.

684
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,110
Haitang.

685
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,240
This is...

686
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,010
I finally made some money.

687
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,340
I can finally pay my rent.

688
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,110
I can't take it.

689
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,080
Take it back.

690
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,420
Just take it.

691
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,180
You need the money to raise your child.

692
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,040
I won't take it.

693
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,350
If you want me and Changle

694
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,830
to stay here without worries for a long time,

695
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,760
just take it.

696
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,230
The restaurant is having a hard time.

697
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,960
I know you need money urgently.

698
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,710
Besides, at the stall I set up,

699
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,840
a lot of those things

700
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,390
were made by you.

701
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,440
Let's not

702
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,580
stand on ceremony anymore.

703
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:45,740
Okay.

704
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,490
I'll take it then.

705
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,150
You really made quite a lot of money.

706
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,880
Haitang.

707
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,020
Haitang.

708
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,270
Some government officials were here.

709
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,140
They said that stupid An took over the Ministry of Revenue.

710
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,730
We can reopen soon.

711
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,140
That's great.

712
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,330
That stupid An.

713
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,050
He still has a conscience.

714
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,350
Everyone,

715
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,070
today is the reopening of Nine Regions Food Collection.

716
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,140
The dishes have been adjusted.

717
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,590
Would you like to come in and have a taste?

718
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,140
Come on in.

719
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,450
This way please.

720
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,600
You are here again.

721
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,380
Welcome.

722
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,420
Put it here.

723
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,730
These are the new dishes.

724
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,220
Try it.

725
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,710
Ladies and gentlemen,

726
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,440
this is one of our blind dishes,

727
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,730
Eight-treasure duck.

728
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,890
There are eight ingredients in it.

729
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,920
Only Chef knows what's put inside.

730
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,520
If you want to know,

731
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,290
you have to try it yourself.

732
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,530
If you are lucky,

733
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,360
you may find abalone or shark fin inside the duck.

734
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,370
If not,

735
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,240
please come again.

736
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,970
The four sauces

737
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,310
are specially made by our restaurant.

738
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,140
The signature mixed sauce is salty and delicious.

739
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,880
The classic smoked sauce has a smell of barbecue.

740
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,980
The lemon pepper sauce is refreshing.

741
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,400
While the buttered garlic sauce is fresh and sweet.

742
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,200
Please enjoy.

743
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,040
Please enjoy.

744
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,790
Thank you.

745
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,420
Thank you.

746
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,040
Here, try it.

747
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,010
Haitang,

748
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,360
we may need to

749
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,160
redo our accounts of this month.

750
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,350
Let's write the accounts during closing and after reopening

751
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,210
separately

752
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,870
so that we can calculate profits more clearly in the future.

753
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,400
Okay.

754
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,410
Wei.

755
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,840
I found you're becoming more and more like Yuan Ying.

756
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
She is my teacher.

757
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,550
Who else should I be like?

758
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,820
Ms. Yuan Ying.

759
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,770
I can get five points this time, right?

760
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,630
Eight?

761
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,390
Only two to ten.

762
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,810
I'm amazing.

763
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,060
Keep up the good work for the last two points.

764
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,220
I'm leaving.

765
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,580
[Prison]

766
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,660
We just want to go in and have a look.

767
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,720
Please make an exception for us, Sir.

768
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,930
Hao Jia.

769
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,930
Fangru.

770
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,180
I didn't expect

771
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,500
you would care so much about me.

772
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,100
Care about you?

773
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,420
Wake up.

774
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,890
Don't you know

775
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,550
how you treated us before?

776
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,660
How dare you think like that?

777
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,380
You are really shameless.

778
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,380
Your Highness.

779
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,410
I'm afraid this is the last time I call you "Your Highness".

780
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,370
I'm here today

781
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,890
to ask you to sign this.

782
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,660
This is a divorce letter.

783
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,330
Ridiculous.

784
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,070
Ridiculous?

785
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,390
I think

786
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,080
what's ridiculous is

787
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,830
the time I spent with you.

788
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,850
I just want to tell you

789
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,160
there's no room of negotiation

790
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,590
between us.

791
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,340
In the future, I'll also tell my child

792
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,940
what kind of person her father was.

793
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,450
When she grows up,

794
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,020
she'll make her own judgments.

795
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:31,960
By the way,

796
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,380
there's one thing I forgot to tell you about.

797
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,990
My daughter's surname,

798
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:38,970
is Hao.

799
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,160
♫Longing for softness♫

800
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,690
♫Harvesting what was planted♫

801
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,980
♫Gaining a moment of pleasure♫

802
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,630
♫Bearing endless sorrow♫

803
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,740
♫Writing down a dirge♫

804
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,830
♫Falling behind the flying time♫

805
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:51,300
♫Life is still long, how will it drag by?♫

806
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,640
♫Like the autumn scenery♫

807
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,440
♫Like blooming fireworks♫

808
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,300
♫Gone in a twinkling♫

809
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,420
♫With only silence left♫

810
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,280
♫But I'm still obsessed♫

811
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:10,130
♫With being a moth, flying to the flames♫

812
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:19,000
♫Singly stepping on the one-log bridge regardless of the strong wind, going astray♫

813
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:26,690
♫No looking back while the way ahead has no end♫

814
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:34,690
♫Just make myself trapped by obsession, and keep falling♫

815
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,930
♫No one knows, I used♫

816
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,190
♫To drift with wind♫

817
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,390
♫Beyond the control of this world♫

818
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,830
♫Just for a promise♫

819
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,390
♫I've lived with joys and sorrows♫

820
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,590
♫Been through frustrations and hardships♫

821
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,590
♫And learned how hard it is to know one's true heart♫

822
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:29,220
♫How should I go through the abyss-like palace life?♫

823
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,550
♫Sighing for the blossom fall♫

824
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,320
♫Sighing for the sunset♫

825
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,290
♫For the bit of desolation♫

826
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,190
♫It looks delicate♫

827
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,340
♫It looks lonely♫

828
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:47,850
♫Knowing the destiny but still choosing to accept it♫

829
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:56,790
♫Singly stepping on the one-log bridge regardless of the strong wind, going astray♫

830
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,950
♫No looking back while the way ahead has no end♫
