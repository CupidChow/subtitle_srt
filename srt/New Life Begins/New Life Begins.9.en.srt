[Episode 9]

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,880
My Lord.

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,180
I've come up with a plan on

6
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,450
how to pay off our debt to Jinchuan.

7
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,680
Jinchuan lacks mineral resources.

8
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,370
My legal wife's family

9
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,940
is in charge of half of Daichuan's mines.

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,380
In the past, they've only traded with us.

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
I can make the call

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,350
to let them provide coal for Jinchuan

13
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,600
so that we can suspend the repayment.

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,660
It's better not to get Daichuan involved

15
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,720
in the affairs between Xinchuan and Jinchuan.

16
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,650
Xinchuan is Daichuan's biggest buyer,

17
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,180
so we can indeed hold them down with our power.

18
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,360
But we've never done such a thing before.

19
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,490
Otherwise,

20
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,420
we wouldn't be qualified as the head of the nine regions.

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,329
My Lord,

22
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,530
I thought...

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,079
Enough.

24
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,050
You've worried enough all night.

25
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,150
Go back and rest.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,420
As for the debt,

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,860
you all go back and think about it.

28
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,579
Dismissed.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,670
Dismissed.

30
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,820
Farewell, My Lord.

31
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,640
Brother.

32
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,190
My Lord.

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,320
The princes are still at school.

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,340
When you are upset, My Lord,

35
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,200
you usually like to talk to Madam.

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,300
Shall we...

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,950
Forget it.

38
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,990
What class is Dai Di teaching today?

39
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,650
I don't know.

40
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,280
Do you want to go there and take a look, My Lord?

41
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,480
When he teaches class, he likes to talk about the current situation as well.

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,710
Let's go.

43
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,130
Stop.

44
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,100
Descend the palanquin.

45
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,120
Prince Yue, I've told you last time that

46
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,850
your article about the debt

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,630
is not appropriate.

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,970
Now,

49
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,900
do you have any new ideas?

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,470
I...

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,480
I don't have any.

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,210
Why don't you ask the Ninth Prince?

53
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,070
I... I have no idea either.

54
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,440
Why don't you ask Yan?

55
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,510
What do you have in mind, Prince Zheng?

56
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,600
Mr. Dai.

57
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,320
You've asked all of them.

58
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,710
Why don't you ask me?

59
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,510
Fine.

60
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,250
Let's hear your opinion, Prince Qi.

61
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,550
About this,

62
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,659
I think

63
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,320
I have no idea.

64
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,300
Prince Zheng.

65
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,520
Go ahead.

66
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,530
In my humble opinion,

67
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,870
according to Xinchuan's law, debt must be paid off.

68
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,060
If we really can't afford to repay all of it,

69
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,520
we can pay by installment.

70
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,760
But no matter what other regions' attitude is,

71
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,890
we shouldn't refuse to repay the debt.

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,640
Since we can't collect the external debts in time,

73
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,100
maybe we can make plans with internal debts.

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,320
After all, we should look at the bigger picture here.

75
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,280
Harmony should be regarded as priority since Xinchuan is the head region.

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,810
Good.

77
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,500
Good idea.

78
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,010
It still needs to be completed though.

79
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:40,980
My Lord.

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,130
Prince Zheng's idea is exactly the same as yours.

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,500
Tell Zheng to come see me alone after class.

82
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,010
Yes.

83
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,630
If, as you said,

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,600
we clear the messed-up accounts in Ministry of Revenue accumulated for years,

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
how much of the debt can we repay?

86
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,220
More than 30%.

87
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,320
But those who borrowed money from the Ministry of Revenue

88
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,950
are all wily old birds.

89
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,810
Yes.

90
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,770
After all, you're still young.

91
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,570
You can't handle them yourself.

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
You should

93
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
ask your eldest brother about this.

94
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,060
Thank you for your reminders, Father.

95
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,470
I won't think too highly of myself.

96
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,240
I will definitely ask my experienced brother to assist me.

97
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,570
Good.

98
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,280
If it works,

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,330
you'll be the one to go to Jinchuan to return the debts

100
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,140
and persuade Lord Jinchuan to accept the first payment

101
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,400
and let us repay the rest by installment.

102
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,850
But don't alert others.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Don't let the people from other regions know the details about this.

104
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,650
Understood.

105
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,040
I have another suggestion.

106
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,400
Besides getting back the external debts,

107
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,640
I think we should restrain expenses in the palace as well.

108
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
To set an example,

109
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,740
the Prince Mansion will be the first.

110
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,150
Pass my order.

111
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,720
Everyone in Xinchuan Palace should set an example.

112
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
From tomorrow on,

113
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,730
no expenses shall be added.

114
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,960
By the way,

115
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,620
especially make it clear to An.

116
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,510
He's always the most extravagant one.

117
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,190
Yes.

118
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,650
[Prince An's Mansion]

119
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,690
Father ordered to save expenses,

120
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,420
especially to me.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He told me not to be extravagant.

122
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,760
Although I have a lot of money outside the palace,

123
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,290
I'm determined to put an end to extravagance.

124
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,220
I can't lose to my other brothers.

125
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,440
So fake.

126
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,340
It's just because Lord Xinchuan doesn't allow him

127
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,000
to bring the outside money in.

128
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,810
Puffing himself up at his own cost.

129
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,900
As my women in the inner courtyard,

130
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,780
you must abide by the rules

131
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,150
and serve me accordingly.

132
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,610
To make me feel at ease is to make Xinchuan

133
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,740
and the whole world at ease.

134
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,550
Why do I feel like

135
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,010
he's going to say something treacherous?

136
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,550
From now on,

137
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,660
your monthly salary

138
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,140
is gone.

139
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,690
My mother is from Jinchuan.

140
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,170
Therefore, I'm half a Jinchuan person.

141
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,770
So I should show the spirit of

142
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,780
Jinchuan, aiming high.

143
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,179
If other brothers save one penny,

144
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll save ten.

145
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,179
From now on,

146
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,799
I will hand in my monthly salary

147
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,799
to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

148
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,400
We'll only spend 50 tael each month from now on.

149
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,410
Why hasn't the thunder killed him?

150
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,280
Are you done drawing?

151
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm late.

152
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,800
I was stalled after school today.

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
Don't eat if you're late.

154
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,970
Today,

155
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,610
Lord appointed the task of repaying Jinchuan's debt

156
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,590
to Zheng.

157
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,180
Who told me

158
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,990
that Lord would definitely be satisfied with my idea?

159
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,220
I dare not talk about court affairs.

160
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,550
Your Highness, you said

161
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,890
that Her Ladyship's family can help repay Jinchuan's...

162
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,420
How dare you talk back?

163
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,050
I dare not.

164
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,660
I said before that

165
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,700
in this mansion,

166
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,210
everyone has to take me as your boss.

167
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,010
When I'm right, I'm right.

168
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
When I'm wrong, I'm still right.

169
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,750
If you still want to have a proper place

170
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,780
in this mansion,

171
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,560
bear it in mind clearly.

172
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,120
What does this have to do with my original family?

173
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,350
Not much.

174
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,690
I just wanted to use your family's mine

175
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,350
to repay the debt to Jinchuan.

176
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,410
However, Lord

177
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,610
didn't want Daichuan to get involved.

178
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,170
So forget it.

179
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,150
But...

180
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,470
Your Highness.

181
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,880
Don't you think

182
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,270
you should have talked to me about such a big deal?

183
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,010
What's there to say?

184
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,040
It didn't work out. Why should I talk to you?

185
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,620
You just

186
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,560
mind your own business in the mansion.

187
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,940
Lord ordered

188
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,250
to reduce the expenses.

189
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,850
Hao Jia, you don't have to eat tonight.

190
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,770
When you're hungry,

191
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,370
you'll know who's the one feeding you.

192
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,290
You'll be more respectful.

193
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,470
Pour me some wine.

194
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,200
From today on,

195
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,000
the inner court study hall will also reduce the expenses.

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,550
The expenses will cover both studies and flower arrangement.

197
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,370
Draw the flowers you have in mind first.

198
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,500
I'm hungry.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,110
Me too.

200
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,650
Didn't you have breakfast?

201
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,960
Me neither.

202
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,360
What's wrong?

203
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,290
The food in your mansion is bad too?

204
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,630
It's all because of the expense reduction.

205
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,020
All the mansions cook their own meals now.

206
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,180
Zhao Fangru is from Daichuan.

207
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,180
She likes her food smelly and spicy.

208
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,770
In my room,

209
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,900
I wake up to

210
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,180
stinky tofu and Liuzhou river snails rice noodles.

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,000
It smells like

212
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,940
I'm in a toilet.

213
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,440
Liuzhou river snails rice noodles and stinky tofu?

214
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,700
I've never tried them.

215
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,740
You want it?

216
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,190
If you want,

217
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,670
I'll get it for you.

218
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,930
Thank you, Hao Jia.

219
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,480
I stole it from Zhao Fangru.

220
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,190
Eat up.

221
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,420
Hao Jia.

222
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,060
You're such a good person.

223
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,560
It does stink.

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,690
Is it good?

225
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,980
Yes.

226
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,770
Yes?

227
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,740
Eat more.

228
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,360
Thank you.

229
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,240
Why would anyone like such stinky food?

230
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,540
Last time you told me

231
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,000
about something that's also delicious

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,710
besides Liuzhou river snails rice noodles. What is it?

233
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,540
Stinky tofu.

234
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,970
Stinky tofu?

235
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,580
I want some of that too.

236
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,540
I'll bring it to you next time.

237
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
My Lady, smell it.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The smell came from this direction.

239
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,400
Little bastard.

240
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,450
How dare you steal from me?

241
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,380
Let's go.

242
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,100
The food is good, right?

243
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:14,970
Not bad.

244
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,560
Get up.

245
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,450
Hao Jia.

246
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,680
How dare you

247
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,210
covet my stuff?

248
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,370
My Lady.

249
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,230
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,050
My Lady.

251
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,960
It's because I was greedy.

252
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,160
I asked Hao Jia to steal it.

253
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,920
I forced her.

254
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,920
It's not her fault.

255
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,570
No.

256
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,000
I did steal it.

257
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
Please don't blame Li Wei.

258
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,990
Just punish me.

259
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,200
Stop acting like loving sisters here.

260
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,750
I won't buy it.

261
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,500
What?

262
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,260
How dare you stand in front of me?

263
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,010
How could you not...

264
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,660
You've eaten it up?

265
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,940
I accidentally...

266
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,170
Do you really like it?

267
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,840
Yes.

268
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,210
I heard that Your Ladyship is from Daichuan.

269
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,970
There are many specialties of Daichuan at your place.

270
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,240
I also heard that Liuzhou river snails rice noodles smell stinky

271
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,120
but taste good.

272
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,750
I got greedy, so I...

273
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm sorry, My Lady.

274
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,170
Few people

275
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,700
appreciate such cuisine.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,870
Do you

277
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,350
deserve to eat my favorite food?

278
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,770
Fine.

279
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,960
I think

280
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,270
I'll spare you this time.

281
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,970
Get up.

282
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,930
But if you do it again,

283
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,960
you'll be punished by the family rules.

284
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,410
Let's go.

285
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,320
[Prince Qi's Palace]

286
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
A drumstick?

287
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,600
It's real.

288
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,080
There's even more surprise for you.

289
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,830
Look.

290
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,680
Shangguan,

291
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,210
just eat as much as you want.

292
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,550
After eating, go practice martial arts as usual.

293
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,410
You won't have to starve anymore.

294
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,210
I'm here.

295
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,580
Where did you get these?

296
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,640
It doesn't matter.

297
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,800
I just pawned something.

298
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,620
Try this drumstick.

299
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,890
It tastes so good.

300
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,780
Try it.

301
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,330
Where are you going?

302
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,880
Where are you going?

303
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,810
Try the drumstick.

304
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,780
I saved it for you.

305
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,650
Have a bite.

306
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,350
Try it first.

307
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,030
It's delicious.

308
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,430
Tasty.

309
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,700
It'll get cold.

310
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,950
Why did you pawn the Four Treasures of Study,

311
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,840
and all your paintings and calligraphy?

312
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,880
Even if the monthly salary is reduced,

313
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,550
we can still afford to eat.

314
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,070
Well.

315
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,140
I don't usually use these things.

316
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,560
They are already dusty since I never used them.

317
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
I exchanged them for some money.

318
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,890
How else can you eat?

319
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,610
Right?

320
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,760
Try it.

321
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,710
It's delicious.

322
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,730
It tastes so good.

323
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,240
Try it.

324
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,170
Where are you going?

325
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,910
It's cold.

326
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,060
You...

327
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,360
Where is my precious?

328
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,630
Your precious?

329
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,340
You pawned my precious as well.

330
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,690
I'm afraid you'll starve.

331
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,280
I was wrong.

332
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,810
I'll find a way to redeem it.

333
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,890
I'll redeem it, okay?

334
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,960
No, no, no.

335
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,700
No way you can redeem it.

336
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,650
I didn't expect Concubine Wei to be so good at something.

337
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,190
Exactly.

338
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,910
Growing vegetables is really in the DNA of the Jichuan people, right?

339
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,520
Li Wei.

340
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,640
Your dog sneaked into my yard and stole my food.

341
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,960
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,600
I didn't train it well.

343
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,120
Just a verbal apology?

344
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,800
What do you want then?

345
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
Give me half of your board expenses.

346
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,260
Half?

347
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,370
No way.

348
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,300
I don't have much.

349
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,430
I have to feed my dog.

350
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,930
How about I give you half of the vegetables I grow?

351
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,040
Your vegetables are still seedlings now.

352
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
When they are edible,

353
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,800
the debt to Jinchuan will be paid off.

354
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,060
You don't understand.

355
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
It only takes seven days to for the sprouts to grow.

356
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
It only takes a couple days for the needle mushroom

357
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,620
and 20 days for the pak choi to grow.

358
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,480
If it's more frequently fertilized,

359
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,880
it will grow even faster.

360
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,710
70%.

361
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:08,990
Deal.

362
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,650
Let's go.

363
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,510
Then we don't have to starve anymore.

364
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,670
My Lady.

365
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,860
Why were you so lenient to her?

366
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,600
I was just coaxing her.

367
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Trying to avoid arguments as much as I can.

368
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,800
Besides, she is a girl from the city.

369
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,480
She doesn't know how many vegetables can be harvested.

370
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,030
She won't know

371
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,720
if I give her 30 or 70 percent.

372
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,380
Aren't I smart?

373
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:33,960
Yes.

374
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,570
Baifu.

375
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,830
Dear Zheng, let me tell you.

376
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,160
Your Highness.

377
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,190
I made a vegetable field.

378
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,090
This is against the palace rules.

379
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,430
If others find out about the field,

380
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,870
we will all be in trouble.

381
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,520
You already tried to take my stuff.

382
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,720
Why are you still snitching on me?

383
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,180
I didn't go along with you in your evil deeds.

384
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,430
I allowed it.

385
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,320
If the Ministry of Internal Affairs finds it inappropriate,

386
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,380
let them come to me.

387
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,690
Dear Zheng.

388
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Why are you indulging her like this?

389
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,010
It's not a bad thing.

390
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,440
It can also improve our life.

391
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,090
You're biased, Yin Zheng.

392
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,010
I can see that

393
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,770
you two are ganging up to bully others.

394
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,280
When you went to Danchuan,

395
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,540
you had lots of fun and ate delicious food

396
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,010
while you locked me up in the dark room.

397
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,190
I'm going to explode.

398
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,890
Song Wu.

399
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,850
Don't follow me.

400
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,250
Or I'll never come back.

401
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,730
She was just acting up.

402
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,790
Don't mind her.

403
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,100
I'll go see her later.

404
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,670
You...

405
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,970
You are not hiding from me anymore?

406
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,640
I forgot.

407
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,140
I don't know why,

408
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,410
but...

409
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,680
I'm glad you're not mad at me anymore.

410
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,830
I mean I'm not.

411
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,360
Are you still worried about the debt collection, Your Highness?

412
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,970
Yes.

413
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
It's troublesome to collect debts.

414
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,510
My family used to borrow money from others,

415
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,430
and lend money to others.

416
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,980
Some people are just thick-skinned and refuse to pay back.

417
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,780
Especially those old scores,

418
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,020
which are even harder to collect.

419
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,680
Unless

420
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,700
you are more shameless and ruthless than others,

421
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,200
and know about being patient and precise.

422
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
That's the only way to get the money.

423
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,150
You mean if someone refuses to repay,

424
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,220
we'll have to be more shameless than him.

425
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,190
Someone who is thick-skinned and doesn't study well,

426
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,590
whose behavior is like a debt collector...

427
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,850
There's indeed someone like that.

428
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,260
Prince An.

429
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,740
But it's not easy to persuade him.

430
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
I need to have him on the edge.

431
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,050
Can you do me a favor?

432
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,240
Me?

433
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,180
Come on.

434
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,210
Let's eat.

435
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,010
Sisters.

436
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:50,990
Why are you here?

437
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,510
It's a surprise for you.

438
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,080
Where did you get so many delicious food?

439
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,160
We went to the kitchen of the Prince Mansion for it.

440
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,960
Sisters, you've suffered a lot.

441
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,360
Yes.

442
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,330
You've all lost weight.

443
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:00,970
Wait.

444
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,790
What kitchen?

445
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,240
The palace has been asking us to save money recently.

446
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,230
The portions approved by the palace

447
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,010
are all fixed.

448
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:06,890
By doing this,

449
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,150
you were taking all the food left for this month.

450
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,290
So what?

451
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,440
It's rare for our sisters to enter the palace.

452
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,500
We should eat more.

453
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,030
Right.

454
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,360
It's more important for our sisters to have fun.

455
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,070
Yes.

456
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,410
Sisters,

457
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
to celebrate our reunion,

458
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,400
I'll ask the kitchen to roast a sheep for us to add to the fun.

459
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
Great.

460
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,940
Not only sheep,

461
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,970
let's roast everything we can.

462
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,000
Let's open five more pots of wine.

463
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,380
Okay.

464
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,480
Your Highness.

465
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,630
Your Highness.

466
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm afraid they'll use up the meat in the kitchen.

467
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,480
You handed in your monthly salary,

468
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,000
and you can't bring the outside money in.

469
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,980
If it goes on like this,

470
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,440
I'm afraid it won't last for even three days.

471
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,310
Your Highness.

472
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,760
Hang in there.

473
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,960
This won't do.

474
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,210
Our priority

475
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,420
is to solve the problem of our debt to Jinchuan.

476
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,820
Right.

477
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,740
We must solve it.

478
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,100
Yes.

479
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,170
Cheers.

480
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,020
Your Highness.

481
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,160
Your Highness.

482
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,960
Hang in there.

483
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,790
Please have some tea, Your Highness.

484
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,900
The Jinchuan debt problem

485
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,900
is a great deal for Xinchuan.

486
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,320
There's no time to lose.

487
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,290
I'm visiting today

488
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,160
to see if there is any good idea, Zheng.

489
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,240
If we work together,

490
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,840
we will definitely win with one strike,

491
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,700
and take the burden off Xinchuan.

492
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,150
You are smart, An.

493
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,320
I'm sure you know about my plan.

494
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,340
Plan?

495
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,630
Here are the debts of officials from all ministries to Ministry of Revenue,

496
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,820
[Detailed recording of the officials' debts]

497
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,640
along with their background and preference.

498
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,770
It's all in the book.

499
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,360
Debt collection?

500
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,160
That's right.

501
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,170
I'm good at this.

502
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,280
You can only succeed.

503
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,540
No failure is allowed.

504
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,780
An, please.

505
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,960
Zheng, please.

506
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,480
Open the door.

507
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,200
Pay back.

508
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,030
Look.

509
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,880
Jiang Hejun, former Assistant Minister of Ministry of Protocol,

510
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,090
never paid off his debts.

511
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,930
He owes 13,800 tael of silver

512
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,640
and hasn't paid back in ten years.

513
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,620
Shameless!

514
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,640
[Mansion Yang]

515
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,620
Everyone knows that the Yang family is rich.

516
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,140
You don't owe much.

517
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,400
Why don't you just repay the money?

518
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,220
Why don't you ask around about

519
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,710
who I am?

520
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,240
Even the Legitimate Eldest Prince has to be courtly

521
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,640
when he sees me.

522
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,730
Who are you?

523
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,190
Besides,

524
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,350
why should I pay

525
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,540
what grandfather owed back then?

526
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,960
By the way,

527
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,320
my grandpa

528
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,390
passed away two years ago.

529
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,730
Go ask him for the money.

530
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,940
As for the money,

531
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,690
I won't pay back even one penny.

532
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,780
Hit me.

533
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,960
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

534
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,590
Wish you get what you want.

535
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,550
Wish you a prosperous business.

536
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,990
Prince An.

537
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,960
Our master only does small businesses.

538
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,490
He can't repay the money he owed the Ministry of Revenue.

539
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
If you want me to stop pestering you,

540
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,880
let me go.

541
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,560
Wash the inkstone.

542
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,090
Let's go.

543
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,890
Prince An.

544
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,050
Please don't.

545
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,770
Prince An.

546
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,380
I'll pay you back, okay?

547
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:05,820
No need.

548
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,680
This is enough.

549
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,920
Prince An.

550
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,960
I'll pay you back even if you kill me.

551
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,620
At this age,

552
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,160
you have money to keep a mistress,

553
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,350
but you can't repay your debt?

554
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,680
You're quite vigorous.

555
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,240
This is your father's IOU.

556
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,200
It should have been repaid

557
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,610
13 years, six months and seven days ago.

558
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,550
35,000 tael of silver.

559
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,530
It's gone.

560
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,440
I think I took the wrong one.

561
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,240
This is yours.

562
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,600
It should be 13 years.

563
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,690
It's gone again.

564
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,380
Since you like eating paper so much, I have more.

565
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:40,970
Enjoy.

566
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,010
No.

567
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,080
Prince Zheng.

568
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,760
It's totally your fabrication.

569
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,200
And you fabricated so many of them.

570
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,440
This is not my father's handwriting.

571
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,810
If you don't admit it,

572
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,390
we'll have to go to court.

573
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,450
Let's see if they'll believe you

574
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,410
or me.

575
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,560
Your Highness.

576
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,080
My father owed the money,

577
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,870
but it has nothing to do with me.

578
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,980
It's not a festival. Why are you kneeling like this?

579
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,680
It's for the kid.

580
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,080
Don't stand on ceremony.

581
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,820
Your father borrowed the money for your marriage.

582
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,040
And I've checked the cash flow of your shop.

583
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,280
There's 50,000 tael of silver per month.

584
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,680
The debt is just 35,000 tael.

585
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,080
Why can't you pay it back?

586
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,960
All right. Stop thinking.

587
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,320
I've checked your family's accounts for three generations.

588
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,920
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to your house.

589
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,620
Rich and prestige.

590
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,100
Zheng.

591
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,400
I never really liked you before.

592
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,750
Now it seems

593
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,450
you are quite capable.

594
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,690
We are quite alike, An.

595
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,900
Eat something first before you proceed.

596
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,320
Thank you.

597
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,190
Your Highness, you seem to be really committed this time.

598
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,880
If I can solve this problem and make contributions,

599
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,720
I'll be able to open my mansion and attend court meetings

600
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,870
next spring.

601
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,620
Really?

602
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,550
So,

603
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,800
I can go back then?

604
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,020
Here.

605
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,810
How's the debt-collecting going?

606
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,810
Thanks to you, who sent solar term girl to

607
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,480
make a scene in the palace.

608
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,050
Otherwise, it would be hard to persuade An to do this.

609
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,790
But Prince An doesn't want to reduce their expenses.

610
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,600
Otherwise, they would have left.

611
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,000
Unfortunately, in Xinchuan,

612
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,270
it's hard for women to make a living.

613
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,600
If they leave Prince An,

614
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,780
they can only get married again.

615
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,970
If we were in Jinchuan,

616
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,700
or Danchuan,

617
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,000
where women can make a living on their own,

618
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,930
we wouldn't need to rely on others.

619
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,440
If you go back,

620
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,060
you also want to find something to do?

621
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,000
Didn't you say you'd find someone you love?

622
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
I may look like this, Your Highness,

623
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,400
but I know quite a lot.

624
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,890
I take care of my family's farm, too.

625
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,830
Maybe I'll open a shop and start my own business in the future.

626
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,970
Besides,

627
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,300
finding love is just something I say.

628
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,000
In Jichuan, we follow monogamy.

629
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,210
I'm not even a legal wife here.

630
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,450
After I go back,

631
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,110
the good families will definitely mind this.

632
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,260
In Jichuan,

633
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,520
being a concubine is something to be criticized for?

634
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,440
In Jichuan, no matter men or women,

635
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,230
they don't want to share their love

636
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,230
as long as they have some integrity.

637
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,590
It didn't come out right.

638
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,650
Xinchuan has its own rules.

639
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:13,950
It's okay.

640
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,330
My family and I

641
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,660
don't care about what others say.

642
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,000
If you have any difficulties after you are back,

643
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,930
just write to me.

644
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,240
As long as you ask,

645
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,560
I can do anything for you.

646
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,100
I can handle it myself.

647
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,740
Thank you, Your Highness.

648
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,720
I'm full.

649
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,110
Please eat more.

650
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,410
When did you arrive?

651
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,610
I've always been here.

652
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,540
May I ask,

653
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,010
Your Highness,

654
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,280
do you not want Concubine Wei to leave?

655
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,680
Let me ask you.

656
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,410
Is there a precedent in Xinchuan of turning a concubine into the legal wife before?

657
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,160
You are wise, Your Highness.

658
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,620
This is a good way to keep Concubine Wei here.

659
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,120
I just hope she can divorce me as the legal wife.

660
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,890
Your Highness,

661
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,550
you've never gained anything since you were a child.

662
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,230
Even when it comes to someone you love,

663
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,630
you still don't want to fight for yourself?

664
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,440
If she loves me,

665
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,930
I will try my best.

666
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,820
But now,

667
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,480
I don't want to force her.

668
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,640
If she can divorce me as the legal wife,

669
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,580
her life will be easier

670
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,810
when she's back in Jichuan.

671
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,950
In the previous dynasty,

672
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,280
the 13th Prince once turned a concubine into his legal wife.

673
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,990
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs,

674
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,230
he asked that concubine

675
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,590
to score the first place in the inner court exam

676
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,970
and get qualified first.

677
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,060
When he opened his mansion,

678
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,280
he asked to turn the concubine into his legal wife

679
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,140
in the name of needing a hostess for family affairs.

680
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,930
So as long as I can open the mansion,

681
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,140
and she can win the first place,

682
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,870
this can happen.

683
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,860
Your Highness.

684
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,040
If you let Concubine Wei know about your feelings,

685
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,050
she will definitely be touched.

686
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,240
Even I want to marry you after hearing what you said,

687
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,590
let alone a woman.

688
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,600
Sit.

689
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,910
What are you doing?

690
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,150
In order for me to successfully open the mansion and attend court meetings,

691
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,630
please get the first place

692
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,760
in the next inner court exam.

693
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,639
But I can't.

694
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,800
Are you serious?

695
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,320
Yes.

696
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,110
There's no room for negotiation?

697
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,580
No.

698
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,620
In order for you to open the mansion and attend court meetings,

699
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,820
I'll try.

700
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,760
This is the homework I carefully prepared for you.

701
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,570
Let's begin.

702
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,170
The flowers in the world

703
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,210
are in different heights.

704
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,000
How about some more porridge, dear Zheng?

705
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,150
Scattered at the top, but bunched up at the bottom.

706
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,410
Light at the top, but heavy at the bottom.

707
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,460
What are you doing?

708
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,520
Revising.

709
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,250
Look at the flower arrangement.

710
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,950
Who would put green onions in for flower arrangement?

711
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,550
Vegetables are of the same species as flowers.

712
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,480
It's quite...wildly interesting.

713
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,350
Dear Zheng.

714
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,770
This is too wild.

715
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,000
You even praised her.

716
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,720
If putting green onions in is also a kind of flower arrangement,

717
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,050
why don't you just put all the

718
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,440
eggplant,

719
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:32,880
chives and

720
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,340
chili

721
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,110
in?

722
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,160
Right.

723
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,940
Why didn't I think of that?

724
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,960
Many vegetables can blossom.

725
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,630
Thank you, Ms. Song.

726
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,700
Do you want some sunflower seeds?

727
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,560
What's wrong, Wei?

728
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,850
No appetite?

729
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,960
The winter is coming and my classes are about to end.

730
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,450
Prince Zheng asked me to get the first place.

731
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,580
Isn't this forcing a donkey to dance?

732
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,450
First place?

733
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,090
Isn't Prince Zheng quite practical?

734
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,680
Why did he suddenly push this hard?

735
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,080
Boss has given his order.

736
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,810
I have to do this

737
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,800
no matter what.

738
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,480
But it's also for the best.

739
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,210
If I help him, I can leave early.

740
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,530
You're leaving?

741
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,560
Where to?

742
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,030
Leaving this study hall.

743
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,920
I just want to get the first place so that

744
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,390
I don't have to come to school every day.

745
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,990
How about we

746
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,970
help you review all the classes?

747
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,940
I'm afraid it's too late.

748
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,750
I have an idea.

749
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,510
Why don't we all turn in blank papers and give up the exam?

750
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,640
Wouldn't that work?

751
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,890
Good idea.

752
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,940
No way.

753
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,350
What about you if you hand in blank exam papers?

754
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,150
We are more than happy to be last.

755
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,630
This way, the Ministry of Internal Affairs can punish Prince An for loose education.

756
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,410
That's right.

757
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,390
Why should we help that stupid An?

758
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,530
I'll be the last.

759
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,080
You can be last second.

760
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,330
I want to be the last.

761
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,400
Don't worry.

762
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,980
I should be the last in terms of capability.

763
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,880
Don't take it from me.

764
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,550
No one will take it from you.

765
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,400
You can have it.

766
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,580
It could also be me.

767
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,740
I can't even finish the paper.

768
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,420
Indeed.

769
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,600
I want the pink one.

770
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,510
You want the pink one?

771
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,460
Here. This one.

772
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,860
This is delicious.

773
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,850
Three is five minus two.

774
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,420
Four is five minus one.

775
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,570
Five plus five...

776
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,720
Five plus five...

777
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,950
Add one digit.

778
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,420
This.

779
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,040
Five plus five is ten.

780
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,580
Five...

781
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,430
Add one digit.

782
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:44,710
Six.

783
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,490
Six.

784
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,700
The counting-rod class is so hard.

785
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,600
I just learned to read account books.

786
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,800
I can't figure out how to use the abacus.

787
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,960
Don't you use abacus in your hometown?

788
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,040
For the accounts back home,

789
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,680
mental calculation is enough.

790
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,290
Five plus five is ten.

791
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,890
Add one digit.

792
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,190
Come on.

793
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,740
Let me see you do it.

794
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,630
Six plus one.

795
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,880
Is this right?

796
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,250
Six plus one.

797
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,000
Minus five.

798
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,040
Add one digit.

799
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,730
Seven plus two.

800
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:53,590
♫The south wind meets the clouds and the moonlight calls the candle♫

801
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,530
You're so good.

802
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,280
You know everything.

803
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,720
It's just an abacus.

804
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:01,410
♫As far as the eye can see, it's just a regular sight♫

805
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,550
It's nothing.

806
00:38:59,170 --> 00:38:59,990
No.

807
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,220
You're the best in my heart.

808
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:08,890
♫Why am I being absent-minded? And why am I hesitating?♫

809
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,950
Since you're so smart,

810
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,570
please help me with the rest of the questions too.

811
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,920
♫I'm worried that you'll see through my mind by my eyes♫

812
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,200
Okay.

813
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,200
Let me see.

814
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,780
Don't try to fool me with nice words.

815
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,840
♫My words are not surprising. Nor is my language inaccurate♫

816
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,770
♫I've got some affection towards you♫

817
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,860
Prince Zheng has changed.

818
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,260
He used to be very mature.

819
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,550
♫I don't speak in an excessive way. Nor do I express my feelings♫

820
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,180
You don't understand.

821
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,260
Men are always fickle.

822
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,350
♫Who should I tell about the one I love?♫

823
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,970
I didn't understand it before.

824
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,030
Now I understand.

825
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,600
Love

826
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,450
♫By now, my words have turned into wind, and my missing of you has melted into fog♫

827
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,780
can change a person.

828
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,200
You two know it quite well.

829
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,210
♫I wrote about the past into a letter♫

830
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:48,870
♫If you and I know each other well, there's no need to write more♫

831
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,740
♫My mind runs wild, and I don't where is the way to go back♫

832
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,440
♫I love you deeply and there's nothing else I ask for♫

833
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:03,340
♫I only wish the two of us could love each other as one soul, eat three meals together and spend the four seasons together♫

834
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,960
The debt left in the previous dynasty

835
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,840
has been solved quite well by you two.

836
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,480
We are glad that we didn't let you down.

837
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,870
The debt we collected this time is more than expected.

838
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,810
It's enough to repay 40% of our debt to Jinchuan.

839
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,850
In that case,

840
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,170
you two go to Jinchuan together

841
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,270
and convince Lord Jinchuan to accept payment by installment.

842
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,670
Father, so you allow me to leave the palace?

843
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,600
An.

844
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,830
This is a business trip,

845
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,480
not a picnic.

846
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,810
I understand.

847
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,090
As for the money,

848
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,160
I will ask guards to send it to Jinchuan in advance

849
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,760
and let the nine regions know

850
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,560
Xinchuan has returned the debt,

851
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,120
and we wouldn't break our promise.

852
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,210
You two, dress informally

853
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,600
and leave after the guards.

854
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,420
Don't attract attention.

855
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:15,960
Yes.

856
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
Concubine Wei is amazing.

857
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,320
She said the vegetable would grow in a few days.

858
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,850
We've indeed harvested a lot.

859
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,360
Yes.

860
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,720
Now the problem of our meals

861
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,880
is half solved.

862
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,180
Yes.

863
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,510
All right.

864
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,060
Take this to Hao Jia.

865
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,010
This is for Shangguan.

866
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,530
This is for Sisi.

867
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,800
This is for Haitang.

868
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,420
This is for Song Wu.

869
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,400
We agreed to give her 70%.

870
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,730
Remember to tell her

871
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,050
that the harvest is not good.

872
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,250
Ask her to forgive me.

873
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,090
Let's go.

874
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,340
Wei is really talented.

875
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,240
The vegetables she grew is even better than those from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

876
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,210
That's why we say

877
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,560
sisters are more reliable at critical moments.

878
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,800
That darn An only cares about his dignity.

879
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,960
He doesn't care about us at all.

880
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,260
-Exactly. -Right.

881
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,460
I'm so full.

882
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,550
Prince An is back.

883
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,860
Hurry up.

884
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,100
Why aren't you eating?

885
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
We're not hungry.

886
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,540
You should eat.

887
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,040
Don't be like this.

888
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,590
I'll feel bad.

889
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,420
It's okay.

890
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,820
Please eat.

891
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,430
Don't worry about us.

892
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,440
You are so hungry that you are hiccuping.

893
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,040
You must have suffered a lot.

894
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,150
I wondered

895
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,380
if you married me for money.

896
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,680
I didn't expect that when I'm down and out like this,

897
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,150
not only did you not leave me,

898
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,880
you even left all the food to me.

899
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,560
Frost's Descent.

900
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,290
[White Dew]

901
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,440
The bitter days are coming to an end.

902
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,940
We can go home soon.

903
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,870
[Frost's Descent]

904
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,190
I made great contributions

905
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,810
to the debt collection this time.

906
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,010
Father has allowed me to leave the palace and return home.

907
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,520
I'm going to Jinchuan in a few days.

908
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,060
Wait for me at home.

909
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,450
When I come back,

910
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,410
our family will be reunited again.

911
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,120
So,

912
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,400
are you leaving, Your Highness?

913
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:42,180
Yes.

914
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,970
Don't miss me too much.

915
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,880
I'll be back soon.

916
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,350
I'm still here.

917
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,890
You already miss me so much?

918
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,500
Come on.

919
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,810
Let's eat.

920
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,480
Haitang.

921
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,420
Come on.

922
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,080
Eat.

923
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,300
The needle mushroom you planted in your field

924
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,560
was cooked in your way.

925
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:21,900
So good.

926
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,540
After we parted...

927
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,240
Give it back to me.

928
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,920
Two places...

929
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,080
What are these words?

930
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,740
The characters you wrote don't even have shape.

931
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,760
It's not as good as the Eleventh Prince's work.

932
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,880
You can't write the ones of this structure well.

933
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,280
You need extra practice.

934
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,480
I already have a lot of homework.

935
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,740
And you want to give me extra practice?

936
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,760
I know my handwriting is ugly.

937
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,240
OK?

938
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,200
It's not ugly.

939
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,000
It's...

940
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,270
It's quite cute.

941
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,020
At least it's better than Qi's handwriting.

942
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,940
It's not easy

943
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,540
to have even uglier handwriting than Qi.

944
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,400
I said you were a cat.

945
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,170
Now you're really a motley cat.

946
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,490
I'll wipe it off for you.

947
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,630
I didn't mean it.

948
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,720
I didn't mean it.

949
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,730
I didn't mean it either.

950
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,840
What are you doing?

951
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,040
You did it on purpose.

952
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,110
I'm Prince Zheng.

953
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,490
You did it on purpose.

954
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,160
I didn't mean it.

955
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,720
Come here.

956
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,120
I didn't mean it.

957
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,720
Come here.

♫What's the finest delicacy in the world?♫

959
