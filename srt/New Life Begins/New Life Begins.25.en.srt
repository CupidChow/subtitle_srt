Changle!

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:52,539
Changle!

6
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Where is Changle?

7
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Where is Changle?

8
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,030
Changle.

9
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,430
Changle!

10
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,750
Changle!

11
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,110
Changle!

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,540
Changle!

13
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,700
Anybody here?

14
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,139
Changle!

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,229
Changle!

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,760
Changle!

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,310
Changle!

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,280
My Lady!

19
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,420
My Lady!

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,360
She's been crying for a long time.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,180
You may need to feed her.

22
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,140
Don't come over.

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,079
Take her out.

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
I don't want to see her.

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,600
My Lady!

26
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,240
Maybe you can try again...

27
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,440
-She's been crying for a long time. -Take her out!

28
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,120
She's so pitiful.

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,250
Take her out.

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,930
I can't take care of her.

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,760
I can't even take care of myself.

32
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,440
I can't take care of her.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,960
I can't give her anything.

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,040
Take her out.

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,220
I beg you.

36
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,070
In order to take care of you,

37
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,960
your mother even hasn't slept for several nights.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
Just allow your mother to get more sleep.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,079
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,460
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,940
It's all my fault.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,130
It's my fault.

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,100
It's all my fault.

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,140
Your Highness.

45
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,490
You're here.

46
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,380
I heard that Hao Jia cried all day long.

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,550
Servants' gossip goes

48
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,430
that she got possessed.

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
I think it's better

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,620
to let her stay in the side hall

51
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,990
in case that she goes mad and forgets herself.

52
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,850
Your Highness.

53
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,020
It's not a proper time to let Hao Jia move since she just gave birth.

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,930
I've made up my mind.

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,540
There will often be nobles from the court

56
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,530
coming to visit our mansion.

57
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,620
If her being possessed gets out,

58
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,990
it will make me lose face.

59
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,860
Didn't you always trust Sorceress Zhang?

60
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,320
You even invited her here today.

61
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,770
Why didn't you ask her to diagnose

62
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,630
whether Hao Jia has really gotten possessed

63
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,290
before you make the decision?

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,910
Hao Jia has been having a nightmare recently.

65
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,240
She would weep in the wind,

66
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,790
and vomit with a backache.

67
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,360
I think she's sick.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
We should ask the imperial physician to check on her.

69
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,580
Enough.

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,980
She tricked me for so long.

71
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,210
And then what?

72
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,270
It was all false hope.

73
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,720
She should thank me for not divorcing her and kicking her out.

74
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,780
That's merciful enough to her.

75
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,570
Why does the baby keep crying all day?

76
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,250
She's disturbing me from writing.

77
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,270
Ask someone to send this child to the palace.

78
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,360
Let the nannies raise her.

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,760
Don't let her disturb me.

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,900
Your Highness.

81
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,060
She is your daughter.

82
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,490
As you know,

83
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,700
the nannies in the palace won't treat her kindly.

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,200
Think about Prince Zheng's childhood in the palace.

85
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,040
You saw how it was with your own eyes and knew it very well.

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,740
How can you let your own child have the same suffering?

87
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,000
She's just a daughter.

88
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,070
The previous two daughters of the concubines were treated the same way.

89
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,130
It doesn't matter.

90
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,040
What matters is

91
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,050
to give birth to a grandson for Father to make him happy.

92
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,670
Go find more chaste girls

93
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,680
and bring them in secretly.

94
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,100
Don't tell anyone.

95
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,920
Your Highness!

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,760
You want to get new concubines at this time?

97
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
I have the final say in this mansion.

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,990
You just need to do as I say.

99
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,600
It's fine that you want new concubines.

100
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,010
But please

101
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
don't send Hao Jia's daughter away.

102
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,240
Or maybe

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,270
I can keep her under my name.

104
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,330
I haven't had a child for so many years.

105
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,500
I will try my best to raise her up.

106
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,730
In the future, I can let her be the eldest legitimate daughter

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
and get married with respectable identity.

108
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,740
The eldest legitimate daughter?

109
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,190
Stop dreaming.

110
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,010
How can it be possible for you to have my child?

111
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,800
Your Highness?

112
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,580
You...

113
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,380
What do you mean?

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,130
Nothing.

115
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,180
You may leave.

116
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,060
Your Ladyship, you're grounded. Please reflect on yourself here.

117
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,920
Don't go out without permission.

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,700
Your Ladyship.

119
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,920
I found it.

120
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,210
I never expected that the reason why I couldn't give birth for so many years

121
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,540
could be...

122
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,110
Sorceress Zhang came today

123
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,570
and gave these to the people serving Prince Song.

124
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,220
Rapeseed, radix rehmanniae, angelica and Ligusticum wallichii [Chinese herbal medicinal ingredients].

125
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,809
It's hard to notice

126
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,530
what these ingredients are for/make up.

127
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,720
I've been watching over in the kitchen for so long,

128
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,780
but found nothing.

129
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,660
The problem lies in the water.

130
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,570
They boiled these

131
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,610
to make tea for you, Your Ladyship.

132
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,150
Your Ladyship.

133
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,230
Your Ladyship.

134
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,200
It's bitter.

135
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,650
Why didn't I realize it?

136
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,910
When I first came here,

137
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,290
he heard I came from Daichuan

138
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,580
and was fond of my hometown's green tea.

139
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,840
He said

140
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,670
he would pick dew

141
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,040
from the tree to make tea for me.

142
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,160
Since then,

143
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,310
the tea I drank every day

144
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,030
was prepared by his servants.

145
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,850
He also said

146
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,690
he would add some honey

147
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,160
to the tea for me

148
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,240
because it's Xinchuan's way

149
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,600
of drinking tea.

150
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,800
Later I found out

151
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,150
Xinchuan people don't add honey to tea at all.

152
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,020
But I thought

153
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,670
he just hoped

154
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,010
to make my tea

155
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,160
taste more sweet

156
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,040
and that was why

157
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,290
he lied to me.

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,540
But it turns out

159
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,170
that he was just lying to me.

160
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,750
Your Ladyship.

161
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,590
Lady?

162
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,010
That's right.

163
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,960
At first,

164
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,130
I wanted to be a good wife.

165
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,700
I just wanted to help him take care of everything outside.

166
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,980
He didn't want me to go out all the time.

167
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,710
I obeyed him.

168
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,670
I've been guarding this mansion.

169
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,410
He wanted to get concubines.

170
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,650
I just tolerated it.

171
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,950
That was because I really loved him.

172
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,900
I really loved him.

173
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,690
I loved him so much that I almost lost myself.

174
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,670
I lived only for this family,

175
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,350
for whatever in this family...

176
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,710
I even believed

177
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,990
it was my fault for not being able to give birth to a child for him.

178
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,710
It turns out

179
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,780
that the problem's not with me.

180
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,010
Your Ladyship, you can't...

181
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,300
Your Ladyship.

182
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,090
This tea

183
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,210
was supposed to be sweet.

184
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,480
But

185
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,870
why is it so bitter now...

186
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,340
It's so bitter.

187
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,870
[Garden of Triumph]

188
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,380
Here.

189
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,360
You said you didn't care about Hao Jia.

190
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,040
But hearing that she's even in a worse condition after giving birth,

191
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,640
you're more worried than anyone else.

192
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,080
Stop!

193
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,640
What are you doing?

194
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
You don't know me?

195
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,490
How dare you stop me and my wife?

196
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,150
Step aside.

197
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,760
Don't.

198
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,680
Don't draw your sword.

199
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,510
No, you can't do this.

200
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,570
Put the sword away.

201
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,580
Sorry.

202
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,400
Prince Qi.

203
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,000
Lady Jing.

204
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,960
What's wrong?

205
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Prince Song doesn't allow anyone to visit Concubine Jia.

206
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
But Lady Fangru knew it was you,

207
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,360
so she asked me to come out and tell you.

208
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,350
Why?

209
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,560
She just gave birth to his child.

210
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,040
What's his problem?

211
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,480
Calm down.

212
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,680
Let's get down to business.

213
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,280
May I ask

214
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,100
how Hao Jia's condition is now?

215
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,430
Concubine Jia is grounded.

216
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,600
She at first cried day and night,

217
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
and was even afraid to see her child.

218
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,800
Actually, I've seen such conditions before

219
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,270
in the countryside.

220
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,880
The women who get possessed

221
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,450
should have loved their babies very much.

222
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,000
But after giving birth,

223
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,160
some may try to kill their babies

224
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,490
or even commit suicide.

225
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,090
Her Ladyship also wanted to invite someone to take a look.

226
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,620
But Prince Song forbade it.

227
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,570
What?

228
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,170
Concubine Wei wants to see you, Madam.

229
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,870
Madam He,

230
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,620
the Legitimate Eldest Prince locked up his concubine Hao Jia.

231
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,670
I didn't dare to see Madam Xinchuan,

232
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,890
so I came to ask for your help instead.

233
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,460
I'm not the Legitimate Eldest Prince's birth mother.

234
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,440
So I have no right

235
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,240
to interfere in his family issues.

236
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,040
I understand.

237
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,960
I overstepped the line.

238
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,420
But I don't know

239
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,630
who else can help me.

240
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,470
The Legitimate Eldest Prince is mistreating her.

241
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,000
Her life was already tough.

242
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,620
When she planned to escape,

243
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,260
she found herself pregnant.

244
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,970
The Legitimate Eldest Prince has long been wanting a son.

245
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,360
But she gave birth to a daughter

246
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,920
and has been suffering postpartum depression.

247
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,630
If this goes on, I'm afraid...

248
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,450
You seem to care a lot about her.

249
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,040
My family taught me,

250
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,750
one should neither

251
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,930
flatter when your friends are at the pinnacle of life,

252
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,460
nor ignore when your friends fall in trouble.

253
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,090
There's no one backing Hao Jia.

254
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,820
If I also do nothing,

255
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,780
she will really be forced into a hopeless situation.

256
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,570
Please, Madam.

257
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,730
Get up.

258
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,970
Just go back.

259
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,060
Madam!

260
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,870
I'm tired.

261
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,430
I want to rest.

262
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,600
Madam, you actually like Sixth Prince's concubine, right?

263
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,740
Maybe.

264
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,480
This girl has a sincere heart.

265
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,530
Back then,

266
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,300
I was not yet 15 when I gave birth to Yin Zheng.

267
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,150
If there had been someone like her,

268
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
I wouldn't have had to...

269
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,480
Are you going to help her?

270
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,980
Actually, it's not difficult to handle this.

271
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,340
It's just a matter of begging Lord.

272
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,430
No matter how dissatisfied Madam Xinchuan is,

273
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,780
she'll just mock me.

274
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,970
I just thought about how

275
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,760
I was also in depression after giving birth.

276
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,690
I owed my child a lot and lost Lord's favor.

277
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,120
The madams who had been close to me never cared about me.

278
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,890
Actually, I don't blame them.

279
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,010
But to live this life,

280
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,410
everyone can get into trouble.

281
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,470
Who doesn't want someone to help?

282
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,120
If no one

283
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
is willing to help for fearing trouble,

284
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,310
then what's left between people can only be indifference.

285
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,040
That's true.

286
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,120
The imperial physician said

287
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,310
since he couldn't see Hao Jia in person,

288
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:00,110
he could only prescribe some medicine to help sooth her liver and relieve depression.

289
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,650
What to do...

290
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,890
Aren't you going in?

291
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,420
You said you were going to the Imperial Hospital.

292
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,160
It was because you wanted me to see your mother alone, right?

293
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,410
I thought she'd help without me being there.

294
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,100
But now I see, I was wrong.

295
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
I'll think of some other ways later.

296
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,390
I heard when my mother gave birth to me,

297
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,610
she also cried a lot.

298
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,380
Especially when I was in childhood,

299
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,510
I seemed to be like an enemy in her eyes.

300
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,370
I didn't know why.

301
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,970
Maybe it was my problem.

302
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,360
Yin Zheng.

303
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,190
Maybe the Madam He at that time

304
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,490
was also sick like Hao Jia.

305
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,010
Believe me.

306
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,080
It was not your problem.

307
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,490
After giving birth, women tend to be emotional

308
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,560
and will suffer from depression.

309
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,220
When their condition becomes severe,

310
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,090
they may even feel miserable

311
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,320
when seeing their own babies sometimes.

312
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,440
I'm sure it was not Madam He's real intention to treat you like that.

313
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
She was just sick.

314
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,130
She couldn't control herself.

315
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,110
It was neither her fault,

316
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,880
nor yours.

317
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,270
It was not your fault.

318
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,420
Prince Zheng, Concubine Wei.

319
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,980
Madam He has ordered Nanny Wen

320
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,040
to go to the Legitimate Eldest Prince's mansion later.

321
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,360
Since Nanny Wen can represent Madam He,

322
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,450
the Legitimate Eldest Prince will have to let her in.

323
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,920
Why did Madam Wen suddenly come

324
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,520
and even brought those guys here?

325
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,440
I don't know.

326
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,710
But Nanny Wen represents Madam He.

327
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,180
We can't turn her down.

328
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,130
Greetings, Your Highness.

329
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,840
I'm ordered by Madam He to come here

330
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,300
and ask you a question.

331
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,830
Since Concubine Jia gave birth,

332
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,170
you've been grounding her in her room.

333
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,600
It's unacceptable.

334
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,140
You have no idea.

335
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,720
Since Hao Jia gave birth,

336
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,330
she hasn't recovered.

337
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,440
So I did this to let her recuperate.

338
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:03,480
Fine.

339
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,630
But the rumor has spread to the palace.

340
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,870
Please let Hao Jia come out and let me see how she is.

341
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,490
Sure.

342
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,520
Bao,

343
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,390
go invite Concubine Jia here.

344
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,510
Let them see her.

345
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,280
Yes.

346
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,090
Hao Jia.

347
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,370
Are you okay?

348
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,670
How are you?

349
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,240
I'm fine.

350
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,880
Everything is fine.

351
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,280
Don't worry.

352
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,870
If someone threatens you,

353
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,360
you don't have to be afraid.

354
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,900
Or you can come to live in our mansion.

355
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,850
What do you mean, Princess?

356
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,110
Hao Jia was selected to my mansion among the girls from the nine regions.

357
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,440
Without my permission,

358
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,970
she can't leave my mansion.

359
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,730
For what you said just now,

360
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,450
it can be interpreted as you are insulting Xinchuan.

361
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,650
I dare not.

362
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,610
-But Hao Jia... -Princess.

363
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,340
Don't worry.

364
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,110
I'm really fine.

365
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,170
Everything is fine.

366
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,770
Henceforth,

367
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,460
be sure to take good care of yourselves.

368
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

369
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,140
And don't come to see me again.

370
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,490
You cooperated well just now.

371
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,290
You being obedient

372
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,590
is really likeable.

373
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,570
You've suffered a lot these days.

374
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,930
Take a good rest.

375
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,130
I'll visit you again.

376
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
You don't have to come again.

377
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,200
Just go back to your work.

378
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,530
What do you mean?

379
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Nothing.

380
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,920
It's just that

381
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,520
I no longer want to

382
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,790
fawn on someone who makes me sick.

383
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,360
You grounded me,

384
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,610
beat me,

385
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,530
humiliated me,

386
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,850
and sought the sense of control on me.

387
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,420
It's all because you're powerless in the court, isn't it?

388
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,470
You rely on your father's temporary love,

389
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,230
on your legitimate wife's noble family background,

390
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,230
and pin your hope on your unborn son!

391
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,570
You just look powerful.

392
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,380
But actually you're nothing.

393
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,480
Do you really think you can keep your position

394
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,420
by giving birth to the legitimate eldest grandson of Lord Xinchuan?

395
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,960
Everything you have

396
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,160
was all

397
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,190
rewarded by me.

398
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,550
Your family in Yanchuan has nothing.

399
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,350
Without me,

400
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,440
you could even live a worse life than a rat.

401
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,700
Let go of me!

402
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,360
Are you angry after hearing the truth?

403
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,090
I like to see you being angry.

404
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,020
Do you know why I liked you?

405
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,160
Because you are not like Zhao Fangru.

406
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,060
You have nothing.

407
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,660
You can only live at my mercy.

408
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,320
You can only

409
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,560
stay in this yard for the rest of your life,

410
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,870
and live on my occasional sympathy.

411
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,350
You know it.

412
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,660
Even I

413
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,360
have to live at Lord's mercy.

414
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,730
Even I have to live with a chain on,

415
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,480
let alone you.

416
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,890
You're just nobody, inferior to dirt,

417
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,570
having no right

418
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,460
to get respect and dignity.

419
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,890
I will come to see you again.

420
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,610
But remember,

421
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,010
next time when I see you,

422
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,970
you should show me a better attitude.

423
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,130
My Lady!

424
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,900
Are you fine?

425
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,550
Nothing.

426
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,250
Send the baby to Lady Fangru.

427
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,890
Tell her,

428
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,850
please take care of the baby.

429
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,920
I'm tired.

430
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,930
I want to rest.

431
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,680
You don't have to come in.

432
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,710
I'm fine now.

433
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
Don't worry.

434
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,920
Take good care of yourselves.

435
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,530
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

436
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,380
And don't come to see me again.

437
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,560
Could it be that only if I die

438
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,050
can this be ended?

439
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,260
What's wrong?

440
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,000
Your Ladyship.

441
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,080
I don't know why the horse stopped.

442
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,520
I have a bad feeling.

443
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,880
Yuan Ying.

444
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,360
Something is wrong with Hao Jia.

445
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,680
No.

446
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,360
Something is very wrong.

447
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,330
I need to go back.

448
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,220
Please go find Yin Zheng.

449
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,550

I shall choose Xinchuan, for it's the best among the nine regions.

467
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,220
Since I'm in Xinchuan,

468
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,530

♫How should I go through the abyss-like palace life?♫

480

Concubine Jia is resting.

00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,660
Let me in.

512
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,290
No.

513
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,970
Put down the sword.

00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,580
Concubine Jia committed suicide.

This...

519
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,510
Prepare the funeral.

520
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,050
What funeral?

521
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,050
Why?

522
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,910
You can't just take a glance

523
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,950
and ask us to prepare the funeral.

524
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,680
You can treat her with acupuncture or medicine, anything is fine.

525
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,130
No.

526
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,370
No.

527
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,840
We can't prepare the funeral.

528
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,900
I've tried my best.

529
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,600
Concubine Jia has been in the water for too long.

530
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
There's almost no pulse.

531
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,600
I'm afraid there's no hope.

532
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,660
Please take a look.

533
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,040
Please have a look!

534
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,170
Please take a look!

535
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,200
If it doesn't work, we can get more imperial physicians.

536
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,170
We can get many imperial physicians.

537
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,450
Please save her.

538
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,080
Your Ladyship!

539
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,160
Please get up.

540
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,840
Let me think.

541
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,450
Let me think.

542
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,320
Physician Xu.

543
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,190
Physician Xu may have a way.

544
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,360
He once rescued a person who has been in suffocation for a long time.

545
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,750
But his identity is special.

546
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,949
I'm afraid it's hard to invite him here.

547
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,350
Physician Xu.

548
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,110
Damn, bad luck!

549
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,920
How dare she do this after giving birth?

550
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,110
This is humiliating!

551
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,219
Why didn't she die outside?

552
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,080
Your Highness.

553
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,690
Please watch your mouth.

554
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,800
Li Wei!

555
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,610
How is it?

556
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,130
Prince Song,

557
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,360
I beg for your mercy

558
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,909
Please go to the palace and invite Physician Xu

559
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,670
to save Hao Jia.

560
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,630
Physician Xu?

561
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,040
Do you know who Physician Xu is?

562
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,120
Physician Xu is Lord's personal imperial physician.

563
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,800
You want me to get Physician Xu here at this time?

564
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,560
What if someone thinks

565
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,440
I want to spy on Lord's health condition?

566
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,050
Who will take the responsibility if I'm blamed for it?

567
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,850
I'll go by myself if you don't go.

568
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,860
Stop!

569
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,920
Are you crazy?

570
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,040
Go get her back.

571
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,670
If we screw this up, both of us will be in trouble.

572
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,020
Go.

573
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,389
Zhao Fangru!

574
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,380
Stop!

575
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,280
Lord had a headache today.

576
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,360
He took the medicine and went to bed.

577
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,030
I'm afraid you can't go in.

578
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,430
This is an emergency.

579
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,240
Please let us in to see Lord.

580
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,200
Can we ask Physician Xu to go save a life first?

581
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,800
It's a matter of life and death.

582
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,720
Physician Xu is Lord's personal imperial physician.

583
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,290
It'll be troublesome if he's invited out without being permitted.

584
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,570
Please forgive me.

585
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,060
Please make an exception.

586
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,860
We'll report it to Lord later.

587
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,130
Everything has nothing to do with you.

588
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,630
I really can't do it today.

589
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,200
Please think of another way.

590
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,920
What happened?

591
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,080
Yuan Ying sent a message

592
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,320
that Hao Jia's life is in danger.

593
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,800
I need to get the imperial physician to save her.

594
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,260
Wait...

595
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,280
You don't look like you're asking for a favor...

596
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,160
You look like you're going to break into the palace!

597
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,930
I don't care.

598
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,670
Wait!

599
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,560
What are you doing?

600
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,800
You're Danchuan's princess.

601
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,620
Things can be worse if you break into Xinchuan's palace.

602
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,640
I'll go on your behalf.

603
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,320
What are you doing?

604
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,980
You will go?

605
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,100
Do you know how to use this spear?

606
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,620
Let go.

607
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,010
Don't be impulsive.

608
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,770
Physician Xu.

609
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,480
Who are you?

610
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,360
Terrible eyesight!

611
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,120
Not even able to recognize me?

612
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,430
What's the matter, Prince Qi?

613
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,960
What is it?

614
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,640
It's a matter of life and death.

615
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,440
I come to get Physician Xu to save a life.

616
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,800
You can't enter without Lord's permission.

617
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,280
I will explain it to Lord.

618
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,880
Physician Xu!

619
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,760
Who is it?

620
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,280
It's me, Physician Xu.

621
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,760
Me...

622
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,660
[Physician Xu]

623
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Prince Qi.

624
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,800
Step aside.

625
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Physician Xu.

626
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,520
Why are you...

627
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,120
Physician Xu.

628
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,240
Come with me to save life.

629
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,070
Whose life?

630
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,400
I mean, it's not important.

631
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,000
It's urgent...

632
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,930
I cannot do that.

633
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,320
Without Lord's permission,

634
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,000
I dare not leave the palace.

635
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,020
Why are you so pedantic?

636
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,620
Tomorrow,

637
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,520
I'll explain it in detail

638
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,760
to Father, okay?

639
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,160
Come with me to save life!

640
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,280
Move!

641
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,510
Move!

642
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
If you don't let us go,

643
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,610
Physician Xu will have to save my life here.

644
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,310
Step aside.

645
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Come with me.

646
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,020
Hurry!

647
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,450
Don't push me.

648
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,190
Step back.

649
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,670
Don't push me.

650
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,550
Step back.

651
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,490
Step back! Stay away from me!

652
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,520
Don't push me.

653
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,390
Step back.

654
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,560
Prince Qi!

655
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,720
Please don't.

656
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,800
This is an offense to Lord!

657
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,480
It's a matter of life and death.

658
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,520
I don't care.

659
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,800
I must take him away today.

660
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,470
Move!

661
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,120
Step aside...

662
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,030
Get in.

663
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,740
Move!

664
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,400
Hurry!

665
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:07,760
Supervisor Liang.

666
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
Send him back now

667
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,000
so that it can still be covered up.

668
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,160
Once Physician Xu gets in touch with outsiders,

669
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,840
you will be suspected

670
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,370
of inquiring about Lord's health condition!

671
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,300
We'll send him back before 7 a.m.

672
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,470
Please make an exception.

673
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,680
Prince Zheng!

674
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,840
Go get a hot one.

675
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,040
Your Ladyship.

676
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,370
I brought the baby here.

677
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,410
Give it to me.

678
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,710
What are you doing,

679
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,830
I must let Hao Jia hear the baby cry

680
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,910
and let her know

681
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,370
there is a baby waiting for her to wake up.

682
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,920
She can't die.

683
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,660
She must wake up.

684
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Stop right there!

685
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Get out of the way!

686
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,740
If you don't,

687
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,400
I'll kill myself on the spot

688
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,520
and let my blood spray on your face.

689
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,180
Step aside.

690
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,490
Send Physician Xu back to the palace.

691
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:31,780
Yes.

692
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,520
Who dares to do so!

693
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,960
We must save Hao Jia's life today.

694
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,560
Your Highness,

695
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,880
we've brought the imperial physician here.

696
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,720
Please be kind.

697
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,920
Let us go in and save Hao Jia.

698
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,880
Make it clear.

699
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,260
Hao Jia is mine.

700
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,820
I'm in charge of her life.

701
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,480
It has nothing to do with outsiders like you.

702
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
She's not your object.

703
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,280
She's a human.

704
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,200
She's a human.

705
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,240
Who is she?

706
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,660
She tried so hard to come to me.

707
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,970
I gave her a chance.

708
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,000
But now she wants to die in my mansion

709
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,530
and only brings me bad luck.

710
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,900
Since she wants to die,

711
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,000
then I'll allow her to die.

712
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,850
Shameless!

713
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,610
Bitch!

714
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,680
Step back!

715
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,350
Yin Zheng!

716
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,600
Go.

717
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,440
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

718
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,740
Hurry up!

719
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,130
Physician, go!

720
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,740
You bastard!

721
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,010
How dare you!

722
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,340
Aren't you afraid if I report this to Father?

723
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,660
If you want to tell on others,

724
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,490
you'd better first be clear about what you've done.

725
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,020
I know very well how you've made profits

726
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,880
in the Ministry of Revenue.

727
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,130
Be careful!

728
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,280
Physician.

729
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,500
How is she?

730
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,430
The physician has been in there for so long.

731
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,890
Why hasn't he come out yet?

732
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,800
Don't worry.

733
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,970
Let's wait.

734
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,140
It's all my fault.

735
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,100
If I had cared more about her,

736
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,780
she wouldn't have been like this.

737
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,170
It's not your fault.

738
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,520
How can it be your fault?

739
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,280
It's all

740
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Yin Song's fault.

741
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,740
She's taken the medicine,

742
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,190
and been treated with acupuncture.

743
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,190
Why does she still have no reaction?

744
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,880
I did everything I could.

745
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,470
Now we can only depend on the destiny of Concubine Jia.

746
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,570
If she can wake up,

747
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,810
then she will live.

748
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,500
If not...

749
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,670
My Lady.

750
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,160
My Lady.

751
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,760
Don't cry.

752
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,940
Your lady is still alive.

753
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:38,890
Hao Jia.

754
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,600
Listen to me.

755
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,830
You must wake up today.

756
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,040
Otherwise,

757
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,850
when your baby grows up,

758
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,660
I'll tell her

759
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,400
you voluntarily married her father to be a concubine.

760
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,060
After you gave birth to her,

761
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,540
you ran away with a man.

762
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,210
And abandoned her.

763
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,520
Hao Jia.

764
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,660
If you're not here,

765
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,170
when she grows up,

766
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,090
I'll let her

767
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,600
become a bad guy like Yin Song.

768
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,660
When I get old,

769
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,590
I'll ask Yin Song

770
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,260
to get her married to someone for his own interests,

771
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,990
just like us,

772
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,700
marrying a bad guy,

773
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,620
and living a miserable life.

774
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,770
If she cries before me,

775
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,960
I'll tell her,

776
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,650
you deserve this.

777
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,590
It's all because your birth mother abandoned you.

778
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,450
It's all because your birth mother gave up her life.

779
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,520
Hao Jia.

780
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,170
Did you hear that?

781
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,070
Did you hear that?

782
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,900
If you really don't care,

783
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,220
then it's fine,

784
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,770
just die.

785
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,580
But if you still have a little bit of hope,

786
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,860
and care about your child,

787
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,620
please open your eyes and say something.

788
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,620
Hao Jia,

789
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,520
did you hear that?

790
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,110
Just open your eyes and say something.

791
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,060
Hao Jia!

792
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,470
Hao Jia!

793
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,780
Your Ladyship!

794
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,550
Physician!

795
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,590
Changle.

796
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,860
Why do you only know this way?

797
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,370
What did you say?

798
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,360
She...

799
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,670
Did she just talk?

800
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,030
Hao Jia.

801
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,130
What did you just say?

802
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,530
What did you say?

803
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,020
I said,

804
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,330
"why do you only know this way?"

805
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,120
Great.

806
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,870
Concubine Jia is awake.

807
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,860
Concubine Jia is finally awake.

808
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,450
My Lady.

809
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,810
Physician.

810
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:47,410
How is she?

811
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:48,770
Don't worry.

812
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:49,950
Concubine Jia is awake.

813
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,030
She's safe now.

814
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,330
Great.

815
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,530
My dislocation is worth it.

816
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,380
Can we go in and see her?

817
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,890
Thank you, Physician.

818
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,500
I heard you did a lot.

819
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,330
I'm sorry.

820
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,150
As long as you're alive,

821
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,990
we're willing to do anything.

822
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,530
You were always unhappy.

823
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,540
That's because you were sick.

824
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,030
Take good care of yourself.

825
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,770
What's most precious to you should be your own life.

826
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:41,500
Understand?

827
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,290
If you have any problems in the future,

828
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,680
be sure to tell us.

829
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,780
Right.

830
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,490
We're all here.

831
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,650
Why bear it all by yourself?

832
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,680
There's hope as long as you live.

833
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,630
If you die, you'll lose everything.

834
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,510
Don't do such a stupid thing again.

835
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,460
It's dawn.

836
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,540
♫The wind talks softly to me♫

837
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,030
♫Listen how the time sings lightly♫

838
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:39,990
♫Fireworks are in full bloom, scattering the sky with the past♫

839
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,860
♫The stars are climbing up my heart♫

840
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:46,250
♫The eyes of the night shine with moonlight♫

841
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:53,320
♫Remembering your face at this time♫

842
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:59,910
♫We stumbled through yesterday♫

843
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:06,410
♫Tonight's dream slowly flows through your fingers♫

844
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:13,460
♫We're about to stay together for years and years♫

845
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:18,980
♫We'll travel together for years and years♫

846
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,320
♫The clouds are quietly looking up♫

847
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,830
♫The sky is light and the wind is cool and here comes a secret fragrance♫

848
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:46,580
♫The paper kite flutters and bids farewell to the wanderings of the past♫

849
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,740
♫The road ahead looks far away♫

850
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,090
♫The world is wide♫

851
00:48:53,670 --> 00:49:00,190
♫Cold or warm, you're by my side♫

852
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:06,560
♫Spring flowers are fearless and love grows among the thorns♫

853
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:13,150
♫The summer breeze is dying, the sun is burning, it's all but ordinary♫

854
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:20,190
♫Autumn leaves fall, waiting for you and me to write a new chapter♫

855
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,840
♫After the winter snow comes the warm sunshine ♫

856
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:33,260
♫We stumbled through yesterday♫

857
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:39,790
♫Tonight's dream slowly flows through your fingers♫

♫We'll travel together for years and years♫
