1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Put it in.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows past my face, it blows through my hair

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And tells me a few words

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The spring breeze blows, the flowers bloom

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's you, it's you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The autumn leaves fall, the winter leaves bloom

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's you, it's you

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Lend me some money

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How much?

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
200,000

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you're worried about me, you can lend me some money

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll pay you back as soon as possible

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Make a friend

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is this your phone number?

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why do you want to borrow money?

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I want to buy a snake

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I went to the snake farm two days ago

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The snake I bought last time was fine

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It should be from the season change

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They've introduced a new snake in the snake farm

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I heard it's a kind of snake that's artificially bred

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's not at all risky to raise it

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's also highly reputable

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Buy snake seedlings

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So fast?

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh my god

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He didn't stop you?

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He didn't ask you how to contact him?

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He didn't say anything

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How sure are you?

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If he's too lazy to care about this

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If he wants to mess with you on purpose

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He'll be in trouble

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sure he's not

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If he wants to mess with you on purpose

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You'll be in big trouble

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ten percent

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ten percent?

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Master

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're here

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
By the way, you've prepared all the snake seedlings you want

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This time it's black plum, gold snake

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
One jin more each

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's you

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't bear to sell it if it's someone else

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Master

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's settle the bill

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're not going to see the snake seedlings?

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You don't have to see it

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The snake gallbladder will be taken away

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Master

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I can trust you

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
By the way

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The market price of this snake is 180 per piece

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll give you a close price

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Two thousand in total

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Twenty-two thousand

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Master

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I only have two hundred thousand

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Twenty thousand

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You take away two thousand

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll sponsor you to start a business

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Be careful

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Master

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Our farm is run by small本

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's like a pet snake

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's hard to buy a snake box

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Boss Wang

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't worry

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not here to search

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm here to sell snakes

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sell snakes?

Master, I'm short of a snake box

95

What about you?

I'll save it for the goods

97

Isn't this

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The snake box I sold to Wu Suowei

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
One thousand black and black snakes

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Two thousand Wang's

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But there are only two hundred here

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
How is that possible, Boss Wang

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Look

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
One, two, three, four, five

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Five

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Five

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How could there be no one thousand

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, yes, yes

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There are two thousand outside

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Two thousand outside

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All black and black snake

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
More than a kilo

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Just

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Snake hit the coal

Boss Wang

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Or

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Talk about the price

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, no, no, no, no

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You want it at will

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't do that, Boss Wang

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The business is about fairness

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We have to follow the rules

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right?

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, yes

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Black and black snake

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
60 per kilo

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Wang's is bigger

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
180 per kilo

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Boss Wang, did Boss Wang ask for a price?

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No, no

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's forty-two thousand

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I heard that

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Boss Wang encouraged young people to start a business

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Without a private fee, twenty thousand

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Then I have to learn from you

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Give me a hand

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Forty-one thousand

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I transferred you another twenty thousand

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Watch

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Watch

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why did you give me another twenty thousand

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Give you back

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Give me back

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Boss, you're not wrong

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I lent you two hundred thousand

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I helped you sell that snake for four hundred thousand

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
My two snakes

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to take a break in half a year

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The price will double

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Who did you sell the first price to

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Twenty thousand

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You really made it

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How do you plan to spend

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Buy

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Buy again

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
How many times are you going to use this trick to deceive him

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This time it's real

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't do this

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Give me a little more

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No problem

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Come to me

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Give me

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And these

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's check the figures

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ok, got it

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The warehouse department has been here for over a month

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
People and vehicles have been investigated

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've dealt with the snake

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He dare not

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What if it's sent to the warehouse

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He would dare not

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Also

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Your snake is so expensive

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sent to the warehouse

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I miss Uncle Lin

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If there is any one who doesn't open his eyes and sells it

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I want to explain to you

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My snake

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Must be in the company

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The canteen is doing well recently

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, it's a new idea

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I heard the new canteen

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The chef is good

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You go

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't eat canteens

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You don't eat rice

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't eat snacks

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
How do you grow so big

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's your business

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Go

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Boss

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm here again

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Last time

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I bought a snake from you

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I didn't keep it for two days

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Boss, I didn't keep it for two days

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I sold it

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I want to say

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I bought another two thousand

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm worried about others

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Boss

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Boss

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You take me to see the snake

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not a snake

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm a person who can't see the heat

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Then follow the snake's target

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
One hundred dollars

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Two thousand

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Twenty million

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you think it's okay

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Then I'll go first

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Bye

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you crazy

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That snake will be listed in a few months

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We only have this one snake

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You sell it

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's a waste of a year

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't sell

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We've been doing it for nothing for half a lifetime

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Look

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I bought all my snakes

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I bought all my snakes

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How about it

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You are really stupid

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why am i stupid

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You sold my snake

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have to buy another batch back

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Otherwise, what do I earn

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I thank you

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Can I give you a gift

236
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,540
You looking for

237
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,740
Nothing

238
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,000
Besides, I am tired

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's just the scare

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Don't sleep

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
HHHH

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Look

243
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Kill me

244
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I will never bite

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
His tail

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't like it

247
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't like

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Run when you want

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,120
Of course.

251
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,560
You must be assured

252
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,160
about what you're giving to Little Su.

253
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,160
How is it? Are you satisfied with this gift?

254
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,720
It's not bad.

255
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,280
What about mine?

256
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,520
Yours?

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,680
Little Su is your son.

258
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
You're the one who gives it to your son.

259
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,760
Little Su is Little Su.

260
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm me.

261
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,440
Fine.

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,960
I'll go.

263
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,040
Here.

264
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,080
Choose one.

265
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,280
You'll just give me this?

266
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,560
It's just for a while.

267
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,600
That's all.

268
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,600
You guys

269
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,560
are all big and strong.

270
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,760
Your legs are short.

271
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,600
It's so ugly.

272
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,760
Can you blow it again?

273
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,240
What do you want?

274
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,360
A snake.

275
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Blow it again.

276
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,160
If I didn't want to seduce you,

277
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,560
this bowl of sugar would have been on your face.

278
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,040
Fine.

279
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,160
Blow it again.

280
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,600
You're really capable.

281
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,920
It's just a two-edged sword.

282
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,360
To seduce you,

283
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,520
I had to practice it.

284
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,760
I can use it to go home on Saturday.

285
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,400
Take a Tang guy home?

286
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,040
Are you going to take Yue Yue home with you?

287
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,440
Are you free on Saturday?

288
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,800
I want to go home.

289
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,080
I'll go with you.

290
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,200
I'll go with you.

291
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,320
I'll go with you.

292
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,600
Are you free on Saturday?

293
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,960
I want to talk to you.

294
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,880
I only go to bed.

295
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,720
I don't date.

296
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,560
I want a new one.

297
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,080
Promise me what you just asked.

298
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,760
Fine.

299
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,760
Blow it again.

300
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,560
It's so cute.

301
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,760
Where did you buy it?

302
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,760
I didn't buy it.

303
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,920
A friend blew it.

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,760
You have such a talented friend?

305
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,000
I want one too.

306
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,040
This isn't for you.

307
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,040
I'll let him blow another one for you.

308
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,800
Da Bao.

309
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Why are you on the same level as my ex-boyfriend?

310
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,120
Ex-boyfriend?

311
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,040
He recognized this brand.

312
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,400
He bought one when he was in the first grade.

313
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,520
He used it for four years.

314
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,880
He hasn't finished it after graduation.

315
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,480
You're definitely different from him.

316
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,440
The gemstone effect of this brand is very good.

317
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,760
Come home with me on Saturday.

318
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,680
You're so good.

319
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,560
But I have pimples on my face.

320
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,640
You should behave yourself.

321
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

322
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,200
I'll go to the bathroom.

323
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,400
I'll go to the bathroom.

324
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,520
I'll go to the bathroom.

325
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,280
You should behave yourself.

326
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,480
I'll make a call.

327
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,040
Go home?

328
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,840
The board of directors of Bai Fang Group,

329
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,440
the luxury wedding car team,

330
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,680
the wedding hall of Meng Huan,

331
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,560
and the top-ranking people are all here to bless you.

332
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,160
You're so rude.

333
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,160
Hello, Gang Zi.

334
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,920
Do you know which brand's quilt is good?

335
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,040
Okay, I got it.

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,120
I'll go and have a look.

337
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,080
Okay.

338
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
Is Wu Suowei here?

339
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,960
Yes.

340
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,560
This is your parcel.

341
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,680
Please sign here.

342
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,280
Parcel?

343
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,680
I didn't buy anything.

344
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,440
Thank you.

345
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,120
What?

346
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,280
Your ex-girlfriend is not as good as you, right?

347
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,720
Mr. Weimeng is not bad either.

348
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,280
Why don't you be with him?

349
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,040
Your ex-girlfriend is so bad.

350
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,960
You and Mr. Weimeng can work together.

351
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,560
You can take revenge on him.

352
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,400
Don't let a person who truly treats you well down.

353
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,320
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,240
She sent me so many things.

356
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,160
Do you think it can prove her sincerity?

357
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,200
You know her father's identity.

358
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,760
Maybe these things

359
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,320
are all broken from somewhere in her house.

360
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
How can she send me so many clothes?

361
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,400
They're all yours.

362
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,840
They're not mine.

363
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,840
Give them to me.

364
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,360
They're all mine.

365
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,240
Don't worry.

366
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,680
I can't take them away.

367
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,880
You don't wear them.

368
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,920
Why do you keep them?

369
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,960
They're so expensive.

370
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,920
I can't wear them.

371
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,960
It's a waste.

372
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,320
I plan to register an account on the second-hand platform.

373
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,920
And put all these things on it.

374
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,080
You don't have to waste your time.

375
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,360
I have a cashier's account.

376
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,400
I can help you sell them.

377
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,840
I can sell them myself.

378
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,800
You're so stingy.

379
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,240
I'm so Argh Frankfurt coast.

380
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,760
Also är好了

381
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,960
Have you received it?

382
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Throw away your pants and your pants.

383
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,360
See you at the park on Saturday.

384
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I just want to wait for you in the hotel's bed.

385
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Come or not.

386
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Didn't someone say that they would sell these things?

387
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Why did they sell them to themselves?

388
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,360
I sold them because I didn't wear them properly.

389
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,360
The quilt is well-made. Why should I sell them?

390
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Besides, there are so many sets of clothes.

391
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
I sold one set. What's wrong? I don't believe it.

392
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,360
This quilt is just one set.

393
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Why should I sell it?

394
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,360
If you have good things, you don't care about those rotten things.

395
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
No more.

396
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
What are you doing?

397
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,360
You little rascal. Don't you care about your master?

398
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
If you keep doing this, I'll read the spell.

399
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
You read it. I haven't even finished reading it.

400
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
I'll read it.

401
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,360
If the city knows that you have such good snakes,

402
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
and that you have the same species as them,

403
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
I wonder what will happen to you.

404
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Hasn't the snake been killed yet?

405
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
I don't know.

406
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
He's been at the warehouse for over a month.

407
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,360
He still hasn't been found.

408
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,360
I suspect that the snake isn't there.

409
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,360
I think Chi Cheng's intuition is right.

410
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
But he didn't find the right place.

411
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
What do you mean?

412
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,360
There's a place that he definitely won't go to.

413
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
What place?

414
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
The canteen.

415
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
He definitely won't go to a place like the canteen.

416
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Then what do you mean?

417
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
We'll go help him find the snake.

418
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
How can I be so kind?

419
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Of course, it's to steal the snake.

420
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
He stole my man.

421
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
I stole his heart.

422
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Isn't that too much?

423
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Shen Nian, here.

424
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
You did a good job, Shen Nian.

425
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Feed him.

426
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Come, Mr. Guo.

427
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,360
Look at this environment.

428
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
It's so nice.

429
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Chen.

430
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
Come.

431
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
This is our canteen manager, Chen.

432
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
This is Mr. Guo, the general manager of Chengyu.

433
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,360
He's also the son of the chairman, and Mr. Chi's good brother.

434
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Welcome, Mr. Guo.

435
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,360
I heard that your canteen is well-run.

436
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Of course.

437
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
I came to visit.

438
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
I'll show you around.

439
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Okay.

440
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Please.

441
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
This way.

442
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
These people are a bit too muscular.

443
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
They don't look like the head chef.

444
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Mr. Liu.

445
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
If you need anything, go ahead and do it.

446
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
I'll go look around.

447
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
You really don't know how to treat me.

448
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Mr. Guo, please take a look.

449
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
I'll go make a call.

450
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Call me if you need anything.

451
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Your environment is too bad.

452
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Master, it's all oil.

453
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Did you see it?

454
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Yes, yes, yes.

455
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Teacher.

456
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
And garbage.

457
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
It's all garbage.

458
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Can you put garbage in the kitchen?

459
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Why aren't you tidying up?

460
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Right?

461
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Exactly.

462
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Look, right?

463
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Look, there's oil on the floor.

464
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Hurry up and wipe it.

465
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
The environment is too bad.

466
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
You can't compare it to the outside.

467
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
I understand.

468
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
Look, here.

469
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Look here.

470
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
You can't compare it to the outside.

471
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
I understand.

472
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Look, here.

473
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Look here.

474
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Look here.

475
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Look here.

476
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
It's too dirty.

477
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Look here.

478
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Look here.

479
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
Look here.

480
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
There really is a luxury.

481
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Can you do that?

482
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
You're still a chef.

483
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
You're just going to do this?

484
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Can you do that?

485
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
What's wrong?

486
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
What's wrong?

487
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Mr. Liu.

488
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Look at you guys.

489
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Your hands are so dirty.

490
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
You're just going to do this without washing them.

491
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Can you do that?

492
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
We'll fix it.

493
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
What's wrong with the environment?

494
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Don't be so stubborn.

495
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Hurry up and see how it's going to be fixed.

496
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
Don't worry.

497
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
Hurry up and fix it.

498
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Hurry up and fix it.

499
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
We'll fix it right now.

500
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Where's Mr. Gu?

501
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
If you put potatoes like this,

502
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
they'll oxidize.

503
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
I just found out there's a problem.

504
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
I just didn't ask in front of them.

505
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
How about I go get you a medicine box in the car?

506
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Let's wrap it up first.

507
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
No need.

508
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
No, you've bled so much.

509
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Go to Jiang Xiaoshuai's clinic.

510
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Let's sort out these cases.

511
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Okay.

512
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
And then when he comes,

513
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Dr. Jiang.

514
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Please take a look at his body.

515
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Dr. Jiang.

516
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
Hurry up and give me Mr. Gu's blood.

517
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
His arm is bleeding.

518
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
It's bleeding.

519
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
Dr. Jiang.

520
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
You...

521
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
Hurry up.

522
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Come with me to the back and get a needle and wound.

523
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Turn around.

524
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
If you want to stab in front,

525
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
it's not impossible.

526
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Dr. Jiang.

527
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
You're really easy to let go.

528
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
If you keep talking nonsense, get out of here.

529
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Okay.

530
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
My goodness.

531
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
There's a movement so quickly.

532
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Why does it sound like Guo Shao's voice?

533
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
It's Guo Shao.

534
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Guo Shao.

535
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Guo Shao.

536
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
Guo Shao.

537
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Guo Shao.

538
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
This one is pretty.

539
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
I think so too.

540
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
The one I took today was very good.

541
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
Look.

542
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
There's a handsome man.

543
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
He seems like a different person.

544
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Come out.

545
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
It's called handsome?

546
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
That's because you didn't see my Chi Chi.

547
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
He's handsome and has a good family.

548
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
He's even more handsome than I am.

549
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm kind of on point.

550
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,200
I'm sorry.

551
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,040
Tonight,

552
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,280
she wants me to go to her house

553
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
to see her parents.

554
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,840
When you become Mrs. Chi,

555
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,560
don't forget me.

556
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,880
Help me keep a person in the circle.

557
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,480
In the future,

558
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,400
I can only count on you

559
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,760
for my sister's happiness.

560
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,160
No problem.

561
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,400
Let's go.

562
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,040
Young Master,

563
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,720
can you give me

564
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,680
the way to the circle?

565
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,240
Sure.

566
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,160
Well,

567
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,360
there's no way to contact her.

568
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,160
Sorry.

569
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,880
Okay.

570
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,840
Why are you dressed like this?

571
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,560
You.

572
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,800
Are you praising me

573
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,680
or insulting me?

574
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,720
Let's go.

575
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,880
When you're alone,

576
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,600
remember to find a chance to start.

577
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
Otherwise, she'll marry Yueyue.

578
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,840
Did you forget it?

579
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,840
It's really magnificent.

580
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,280
It's impressive.

581
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,120
W cares about you?

582
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,040
It means I've never been with an old man in my life.

583
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,680
So, I have changed my gå W to go on a trip

584
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,080
and meet you in the forest.

585
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,520
A nice university,

586
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,040
a regulate university.

587
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,340
Hideous,

588
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
and waitots who insights the old man.

589
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,860
Girls can also be in the forest,

590
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,620
but thestore inside the forest,

591
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,920
the request fee is 3 thousand yuan the whole month.

592
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,140
Is it so?

593
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,240
A few more ongoing projects,

594
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
You...

595
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
You have ashes.

596
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,240
You are a little too big.

597
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Thank you.

598
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
You are not fat.

599
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Your ass is quite big.

600
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
Come on.

601
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Master said that he would respond to Chi Cheng's contact.

602
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Why are you so timid?

603
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
Get up.

604
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
What's wrong?

605
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
You sweat a lot.

606
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Did it hurt?

607
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
No, it doesn't hurt.

608
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
It's just a little numb.

609
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Let me rub it for you.

610
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Use it.

611
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Say use it.

612
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
What a good opportunity.

613
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Maybe this bottle is too strong.

614
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
You two are not related.

615
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I have to give you a gift.

616
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
No need.

617
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Do it.

618
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Do it quickly.

619
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
There are still three hundred meters from the park.

620
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
If you don't do it, you won't have a chance.

621
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
I'm going to die.

622
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
There are still two hundred meters.

623
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
If you don't do it, Tang Yu will get married.

624
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
There are still one hundred meters.

625
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
If you don't do it,

626
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
they will have a child.

627
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
No.

628
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
There is a car.

629
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Go.

630
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
Go.

631
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Look at my remote control race car.

632
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
How fast it runs.

633
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
It's okay.

634
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
It's getting dark anyway.

635
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
There is no one around.

636
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Even if you want to throw away my hand,

637
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I have to do it.

638
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
You take advantage of my girlfriend.

639
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
I will take advantage of you.

640
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
This man's hand.

641
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Why do I have a feeling of affection?

642
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
This is a real man.

643
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
Fortunately, no one knows me.

644
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
He actually held my hand.

645
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Why is his hand so strong?

646
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Hello.

647
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Where are you?

648
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
I'm here.

649
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
I'll be back in a while.

650
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
What's up?

651
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
There will be a dinner party later.

652
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Go.

653
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
I won't let you go.

654
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
You drive away.

655
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
First, take off two bones from my hand.

656
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
Why don't you go?

657
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Don't make people wait.

658
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
It's okay.

659
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
Let's go.

660
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Are you sure that snake is in the car?

661
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
It's a matter of time.

662
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
Do we have to do it?

663
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
I don't believe it.

664
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
I've been to the canteen.

665
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,240
I'm sure it's already in Uncle Chi's ears.

666
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
If something goes wrong with the snake in the canteen,

667
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
it's definitely not related to me.

668
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Then let's send a message to Chi Cheng.

669
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
When they act,

670
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
we'll kill them halfway.

671
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
You're Chi Cheng.

672
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
You're Chi Cheng.

673
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
You're Chi Cheng.

674
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
Are you Chi Cheng?

675
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,240
Are you stupid?

676
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
It's time to change the medicine.

677
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
You still want to go to Jiang Xiao Shuai's clinic?

678
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
No.

679
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
He's not talented.

680
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
It's hard to be a good person.

681
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Even if you succeed in the future,

682
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
you have to be responsible for him.

683
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
You can't get rid of him if you want to.

684
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
I'm serious.

685
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Okay.

686
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
Why haven't you arrived yet?

687
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
I've been waiting for half an hour.

688
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
If you're busy,

689
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,240
give me your parents' contact information.

690
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
I'll contact them first.

691
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Or they will wait.

692
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
Are you okay?

693
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,320
Answer me.

694
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,440
I'm so worried.

695
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,960
I have something to do today.

696
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,520
Let's talk another day.

697
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,900
You were Qu Xiangyuan's teacher.

698
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,120
When did you change like this?

699
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,540
I thought I should play with the teacher instead.

700
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,820
My teacher Stan Blow

701
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,880
is really stepping his luck.

702
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,320
He is so poor.

703
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,400
And I'm kinda useless.

704
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,700
Well,

705
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,220
He just Mile True dumbfounded his head.

706
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,820
Oh, no, I don't know that there was a light or a trap in front of us.

707
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,980
He's willing to try first.

708
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,820
Yes.

709
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,660
Is it completely all or not?

710
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,020
Yes... especially until now.

711
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,100
After all, he wouldn't even leave for some hours.

712
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,700
I only used my hands.

713
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,700
No. What are you thinking?

714
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Just hold hands.

715
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Just like this.

716
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
Hold hands. Do you understand?

717
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,700
I waited for you all afternoon.

718
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,700
I just held hands and came back.

719
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,700
What's wrong with holding hands?

720
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
I still feel that the tension is getting higher.

721
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,700
Back then, Yueyue and I were only

722
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,700
sure about our relationship.

723
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Remember.

724
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
The relationship between a man and a woman

725
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
is different in nature.

726
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
She is just a single-knife.

727
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Today, I was able to cut Yueyue off

728
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
for you.

729
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
It means it's effective.

730
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
From now on, you can just skip

731
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
these hand-holding parts.

732
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
You're so stupid.

733
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
What should I do then?

734
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Join the Aomensin Peking Entertainment

735
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
772772.com

736
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,700
I really want to tell you

737
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
that not only does the sunset

738
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
and the moon

739
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
look like a dream

740
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
but also the stars

741
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
are shining in the sky

742
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
and the stars are shining in the sky

743
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
I want to tell you

744
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
that not only does the sunset

745
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
and the moon

746
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
look like a dream

747
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,700
but also the stars

748
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
are shining in the sky

749
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
and the stars are shining in the sky

750
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
If after today

751
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
the sun will not

752
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
come back

753
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
and the moon will not

754
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
come back

755
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
and the moon will not

756
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
come back

757
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:09,700
I still want to tell you

758
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
that not only does the sunset

759
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
and the moon

760
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:20,700
No fear of the stars and the mountains

761
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,700
The sun rises and sets in my eyes

762
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:35,700
No fear of time

763
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:43,700
The last night of the earth

764
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:50,700
I just want to confess to you

765
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,700
With a heart, I'll go through the end of the world

766
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Maybe there is no regret

767
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:12,700
The last night of the earth

768
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:19,700
When life becomes a long love

769
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,700
The moment the sea kisses the sky

770
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:36,700
I will hold you and leave without hesitation
