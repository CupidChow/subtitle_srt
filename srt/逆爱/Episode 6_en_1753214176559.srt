Wait for me.

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I almost let him do it.

One, two, three, four, five.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
One, two, three, four, five.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I haven't been with him for so long.

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've never been afraid of it since I was a child.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000

Chi Cheng, I dare you not to do it

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you refuse, I will kill you

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Chi Cheng, if you dare to hurt me now

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We can only be physical

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I have no confidence

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You talk to me about conditions

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Then you say something

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What do you think

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What do you think of hitting me

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't want to hear you talk

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Go away

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How about it

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Think about it

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think it's good

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You keep talking about your girlfriend

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000

Go away

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This acting is too strong

97
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How about it

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How about your heart

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This play

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,860
Episode 3

110
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,580

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,060
OK. Jעם abroad

112
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,180
OK

113
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,780
Even you can't come back to notice by night

114
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,860
Master

115
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,620
After the banquet, you can Went to go home

116
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,140
I care

117
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,020
what happened

118
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,180
No

119
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,500
I have no feeling

120
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,700
Why is his reaction so strong?

121
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,460
Nothing.

122
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,820
Dawei, I need to talk to you.

123
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,380
Let's go.

124
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,700
Dawei, I heard something about Chi Cheng

125
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,300
from Li Wang.

126
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,300
I don't know if it's useful.

127
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,060
Tell me.

128
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,620
Guo Chengyu and Chi Cheng are enemies.

129
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,500
What?

130
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,460
No.

131
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,860
Chi Cheng's boyfriend, Wang Shuo,

132
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,940
was killed by Guo Chengyu.

133
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,900
This

134
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,820
directly led to the breakup of Chi Cheng and Wang Shuo.

135
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,020
Then?

136
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,100
Then, the man went abroad.

137
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,700
Chi Cheng and Guo Chengyu

138
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
are good friends.

139
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,460
After this,

140
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,940
they broke up.

141
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,620
After they graduated from college,

142
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,060
they were together.

143
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,420
But,

144
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,820
as long as it's the man that Guo Chengyu likes,

145
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Chi Cheng must take him away.

146
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,420
Damn it.

147
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,140
If he finds out that I'm not serious,

148
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,220
he'll laugh at me.

149
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,100
So you have to think about it.

150
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
If you can't,

151
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,620
you should get out of here as soon as possible.

152
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,900
This kind of person can't be bothered.

153
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,820
Master,

154
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,220
I can't get out of here.

155
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,420
It's okay.

156
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,220
I'll help you meet Guo Chengyu.

157
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,620
I can also

158
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,900
help you test Wang Shuo.

159
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,740
I have a reason to suspect that you're trying to gossip.

160
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,300
Mom.

161
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,500
Xiao Chi is really a good boy.

162
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,620
He gave you these?

163
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,380
Yes.

164
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,220
He just came here yesterday

165
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,820
and left with something.

166
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,020
Look.

167
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,620
This is the Zilin juice he gave.

168
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,620
He said it can reduce blood pressure.

169
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,420
He's really sensible.

170
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,220
Mom,

171
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,620
martial arts is not good.

172
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,820
These things

173
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,820
are not good for your health.

174
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,020
Let's not take them.

175
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
You're right.

176
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
I have to give him some gifts.

177
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,820
Daqiu,

178
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,420
I just picked the corn from the field.

179
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Last time,

180
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,020
Xiao Chi seemed to like it.

181
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,020
Go back and bring him some.

182
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,820
Okay.

183
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,220
I'll cook it for him now.

184
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,820
Bring it.

185
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
Bring it.

186
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,620
Sure.

187
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,420
Where did the corn come from?

188
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Give me one.

189
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,620
I haven't eaten lunch yet.

190
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,620
Do you want me to go down to buy it by myself?

191
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,620
What about the thing I taught you?

192
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,020
You're talking about the snake?

193
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,620
You're right.

194
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,620
There are more than one snake eggs.

195
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
I have a reliable one.

196
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
I have a plan.

197
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,420
I can change the snake right now.

198
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Did my dad notice?

199
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
No.

200
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,260
The kitchen is still watching.

201
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,220
Those chefs are still sleeping.

202
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,820
The snake must be still sleeping.

203
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,420
Move.

204
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,180
Hello.

205
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,300
I tell you.

206
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,380
I'm so tired this year.

207
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,940
What did you do?

208
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,700
I took care of two new snake rooms.

209
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,500
I served a few snake grandpas.

210
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,260
No.

211
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,340
Snake grandpas.

212
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,820
Why is the snake's

213
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,340
snout so big when it's in its eggs?

214
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,620
I want to make a nest for them.

215
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,540
They bite me.

216
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,420
Did it bite you?

217
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,900
No.

218
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,500
You know my reaction speed.

219
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,540
It's going to rain tomorrow.

220
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,220
Remember to bring an umbrella when you go out.

221
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,300
Okay.

222
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,340
I have something to do.

223
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:12,980
I'm hanging up.

224
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,220
I'm hanging up.

225
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,860
Who are you calling?

226
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,740
Something's wrong with you.

227
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,980
I called you ten times.

228
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,380
Nine times, you were on the phone.

229
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,860
And you called me only once for half an hour.

230
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,940
You used to call me

231
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,340
less than a minute every time.

232
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,220
Why are you being so careless recently?

233
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,340
I heard Chi Cheng's sister

234
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,140
will be back in a few days.

235
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,260
From Shi- 생각,

236
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,940
circuit 안녕하세요。

237
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,260
Keep it safe.

238
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,820
So political!

239
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,860
Guru Kang from Ta circuit

240
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,940
from Chucheng.

241
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,620
Did take some notes?

242
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,100
I'm familiar with that.

243
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,540
A few days ago,

244
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,020
Jiang Xiaoshuai came to ask me about you.

245
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,020
Is he interested in you?

246
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,220
He

247
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,100
Get down.

248
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,140
Get down.

249
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,500
Major Guo.

250
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,820
It doesn't look like

251
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,940
he'll stop us from acting.

252
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,940
Wait and see

253
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,820
Doctor Jiang,

254
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
where's your 확�?

255
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,300
The tune?

256
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:50,740
Okay.

257
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
What's wrong, Dr. Jiang?

258
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,220
I have something urgent to do.

259
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,540
Please give way.

260
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,980
You have a very serious disease.

261
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,500
Really? What disease?

262
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,460
I saw the feeling of

263
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,540
backlighting and anti-illusion on you.

264
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,380
You want to live?

265
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,740
Come with me.

266
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,740
You're crazy.

267
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,260
Crazy?

268
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,380
Dr. Jiang,

269
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,860
how should I cure my disease?

270
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,020
I need you to be selfless

271
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,300
and be carefree.

272
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,140
I heard that you have a pet snake park.

273
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,820
I have a buddy who wants to raise snakes,

274
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,980
and want to learn from you.

275
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,980
How does he want to learn?

276
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,580
You have a good pet snake.

277
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,980
It must have taken a long time.

278
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,780
Yes, it did.

279
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,260
Since I was in college,

280
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,300
I have been raising snakes.

281
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,020
Finally, you mentioned the key.

282
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,020
You and Chi Cheng have a good college life.

283
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,220
Do you have a friend

284
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,100
who also likes to raise snakes?

285
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
What do you think?

286
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
But indeed,

287
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,260
in college,

288
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,380
there were people who wanted to raise snakes.

289
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,540
The king of the world is finally going to build a water temple.

290
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,700
But now,

291
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm the only one left.

292
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,020
All his snakes are gone.

293
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,180
Only one left.

294
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,660
He's always by my side.

295
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,700
The person you're talking about

296
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,660
is not just...

297
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,780
That's right.

298
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,860
You know this person, too.

299
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,020
He's Chi Cheng.

300
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,020
Are you kidding me?

301
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,860
Why is Chi Cheng's snake gone?

302
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,700
My son is disobedient.

303
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,540
Of course, I have to discipline him.

304
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,860
If I don't teach him,

305
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,500
how will he go to work?

306
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,300
That means

307
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,660
Chi Cheng's work was arranged by his father.

308
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,180
Oh, no.

309
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,660
Let's continue to talk about

310
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,420
how to cure my illness.

311
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,060
Someone just came to me.

312
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,140
It's you.

313
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,180
Yes.

314
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,340
Brother Gang, let me ask you something.

315
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,220
About Chi Cheng?

316
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Yes.

317
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
It's...

318
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,980
Have you been with Chi Cheng for many years?

319
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,820
Did he not start

320
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,380
his own company?

321
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
No.

322
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,580
He's been with Chi Cheng for many years.

323
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,380
He's been with Chi Cheng for many years.

324
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,980
He's been with Chi Cheng for many years.

325
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,380
No.

326
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,380
He was a snake-rearing man from the beginning.

327
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
That's true.

328
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,420
Can he stay in the company?

329
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,980
I think he has changed several departments.

330
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,500
He has to stay.

331
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,700
His precious snakes

332
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,700
are in the hands of the chairman.

333
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,100
If he doesn't go east, he goes east.

334
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,860
If he goes west, he goes west.

335
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,380
He dares not disobey.

336
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,380
So his work

337
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,260
was really arranged by his father.

338
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,860
I thought he was targeting me.

339
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,020
Why am I only realizing it now?

340
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,380
How can someone as cruel as Chi Cheng

341
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,340
be targeted by a woman?

342
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,060
I have something to do.

343
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,700
You go ahead. I'll leave first.

344
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,340
Why am I so good today?

345
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Yue.

346
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,860
Xiao Gang.

347
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
I have something to ask you.

348
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,900
Yue, go ahead.

349
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,300
I've been calling Chi Cheng recently.

350
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,700
Why is he always on the phone?

351
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
He...

352
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,020
Did he meet a new girl

353
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,140
and keep calling her?

354
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,220
Xiao... Xiao Gang.

355
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,740
Yue.

356
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,740
It's okay. Tell me who she is.

357
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,260
I won't tell anyone else.

358
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,100
I really don't know about this.

359
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
I won't do it.

360
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,620
From now on, you just go ahead.

361
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,300
I'll take care of you.

362
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
I'll go.

363
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,380
He didn't give it to Yue.

364
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Look.

365
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,620
This is the Zilin juice he gave.

366
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,700
He said that people can call it blood.

367
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,380
He's so sensible.

368
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Tell me.

369
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,780
Tell him the truth.

370
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,620
What's wrong?

371
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,500
I'm in a bad mood.

372
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
You go ahead.

373
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,980
Actually...

374
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,660
Can't you hear me?

375
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,420
I told you to go back.

376
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,140
I'm not leaving today.

377
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,900
I want to see

378
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,500
what you can do to me.

379
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,260
I'm sorry.

380
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,740
I shouldn't have taken the medicine.

381
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,180
I almost had no idea.

382
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,340
You can go back today.

384
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,060
I'll go to see you tomorrow.

385
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Wait for me.

386
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,580
Today is his birthday.

387
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,540
When he gave me the small bag,

388
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,620
he could take off even one hand.

389
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,060
Six years.

390
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,220
He probably doesn't remember

391
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,100
what the small bag looks like.

392
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,380
How long have you been with him?

393
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,620
More than three years.

394
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Three years.

395
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,180
They've been together for three years.

396
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,860
But they didn't get over it

397
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,180
in six years.

398
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,780
I've been fine for three years.

399
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,460
How long do I have to walk out?

400
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
If it weren't for Uncle Wang,

401
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,100
I wouldn't have had to

402
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,020
go through this.

403
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,420
Luckily, he's going to be released soon.

404
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,060
If I see him again,

405
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,420
I'll kill him.

406
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
Da Bao.

407
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,940
You've experienced

408
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,260
the love and enmity

409
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,740
between us.

410
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,540
I'm experiencing it.

411
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
I've been experiencing it for six years.

412
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,060
I've been experiencing it for more than six months.

413
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
Da Bao.

414
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,620
You're the best.

415
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,500
You're very clean.

416
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,420
You're very clean.

417
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,100
I'll go get some water.

418
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
I'm fine.

419
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,300
I once dreamed of being with him

420
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,660
for the rest of my life.

421
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,660
Now I realize it's ridiculous.

422
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,260
When we were in love,

423
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,340
no one was such a fool.

424
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,540
Yueyue and I

425
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,620
almost got married.

426
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,500
Do you think I'm particularly in love?

427
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
No.

428
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,340
I'm talking about me. Why are you crying?

429
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,580
Who's crying for you?

430
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,740
I'm crying for myself.

431
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,540
I'm crying for you.

432
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,140
I feel guilty.

433
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,380
What are you feeling guilty about?

434
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,020
I'm actually

435
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,460
not clean at all.

436
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,620
You're correct.

437
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,380
But actually,

438
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,700
you're not clean.

439
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,660
Really?

440
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,380
Let me give you a little proof.

441
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,340
Okay, give it to me.

442
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,660
What are you thinking about?

443
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,860
So?

444
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,620
So?

445
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Chi Cheng doesn't know

446
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,940
I have a ex-girlfriend named Yue Yu.

447
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,300
She comes to take care of me every time.

448
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,940
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

449
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,060
It's quite fated.

450
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,780
Fate is also a fated thing.

451
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,780
You've avenged your enemy.

452
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,380
What's your next plan?

453
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,180
I don't know.

454
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,380
How about this?

455
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,220
What?

456
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,780
You...

457
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,620
You have this idea, right?

458
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,940
Who's that?

459
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,740
Yue Yu?

460
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,700
Why does she have my number?

461
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,980
You're pretending to be my grandson, aren't you?

462
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,660
I'd like to see who's so bold

463
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,700
to steal my Yue Yu's man.

464
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,660
That's not true.

465
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,020
That's not true.

466
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
What do you have against us?

467
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:39,980
I have one

468
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,900
girl whom I like.

469
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,060
I'm after her.

470
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,380
I'm not Okay?

471
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,100
With me?

472
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,740
What kind of girl does she want to be?

473
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,940
Do you have the same number?

474
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,740
Wu Qiqun, you are shameless.

475
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,100
Why am I shameless?

476
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,860
Do you think I'm living a good life

477
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
and I'm not balanced?

478
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,300
You call my boyfriend on purpose

479
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,220
and you don't understand?

480
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,020
Wu Qiqun, I'm telling you,

481
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,380
don't play tricks on me.

482
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,580
I can't look down on you.

483
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,740
You're dead.

484
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,780
Don't call my boyfriend anymore.

485
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,940
Don't mention me in front of him.

486
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,980
Or I won't let you off.

487
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,380
You don't mention me in front of him.

488
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,220
You're so useless.

489
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,220
You really think you're a traitor.

490
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,820
You're afraid to get hurt.

491
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,860
I've decided.

492
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,100
What's the plan?

493
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,300
I must kill him.

494
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,260
My ball.

495
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,060
Kid, don't be afraid.

496
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,780
Don't.

497
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,220
Dad,

498
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,300
can you help me calm down?

499
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,980
No.

500
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,740
Don't be afraid.

501
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,380
It'll be over soon.

502
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,180
It'll be over soon.

503
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,100
Go to work. I'll do it.

504
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,540
Okay.

505
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,340
Go.

506
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:52,980
Come on.

507
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,780
Kid, look.

508
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,060
What's this?

509
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,260
What's this?

510
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,460
A ball.

511
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,620
Do you like it?

512
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,220
Look at the little circle on it.

513
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,580
Is it cute?

514
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,020
Cute.

515
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,380
I'll give you one every time you come here.

516
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,660
Okay.

517
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,340
You can go home now.

518
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,300
Bye, handsome.

519
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:15,900
Bye.

520
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
Thank you, doctor.

521
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,140
Take care.

522
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,100
See you.

523
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,060
Brother.

524
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,220
Can I have your meal?

525
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,060
I heard a new food restaurant is going to be built nearby.

526
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,060
SomeoneShould be a good...

527
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,940
person.

528
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,580
You're not using your values, right?

529
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

530
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,900
But I haven't got the answer I want yet.

531
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,060
It doesn't matter.

532
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,420
What's your intention of getting close to my brother?

533
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,740
What do you mean?

534
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,940
Is it fun to fall in love with an enemy?

535
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,140
Don't tell Chi Cheng about this.

536
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,620
I'm afraid he won't tell Chi Cheng.

537
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,860
Try this shrimp.

538
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,940
It's just a coincidence.

539
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,500
He only knew he had a girlfriend

540
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,980
after he got in touch with Chi Cheng.

541
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,580
He didn't tell him

542
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,020
because he was afraid Chi Cheng would know.

543
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,460
The soup here is very good.

544
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,580
Here.

545
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,300
I made you a bowl of it.

546
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,900
Try it.

547
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,500
I know you have a problem with Chi Cheng.

548
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,300
But...

549
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,060
Do you only use your mouth for talking?

550
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,100
It's good.

551
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,980
This restaurant is so remote.

552
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,380
How did you know?

553
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,420
My company has a special food appreciation department.

554
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,980
They specialize in searching for delicious food from all over the country.

555
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,500
How about this?

556
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,300
When you're not busy,

557
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,140
I'll take you to check in one by one.

558
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,620
So,

559
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,460
you really just want to treat me to a meal?

560
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,260
Do you want to

561
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,980
develop further?

562
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,340
I'm full.

563
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,860
How is it?

564
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,820
Is it good?

565
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,380
This is good.

566
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,660
But it's quite wet.

567
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,620
It seems that it's not perfect.

568
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,060
I happen to want to eat Thai food.

569
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,260
I've watched a lot of short videos like this.

570
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,540
I'm so full.

571
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,100
Master.

572
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,860
Why do I feel like you're being pinched?

573
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,340
You can't talk nonsense.

574
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,660
Let me help you with your homework.

575
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,820
How are you two doing recently?

576
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
We've been busy these days.

577
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,460
We didn't talk much.

578
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,220
Are you busy or guilty?

579
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,980
What about him?

580
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,500
Didn't he contact you?

581
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,660
No.

582
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,940
Since we drank together last time,

583
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,340
he hasn't contacted me.

584
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,940
What else did you two do besides drinking?

585
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,780
We just chatted.

586
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,180
He also told me about his past love experiences.

587
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,820
I've never seen him like that.

588
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,900
He sounds quite pitiful.

589
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,660
Is it possible that

590
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,540
such a strong person like him

591
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,580
suddenly showed an unknown side in front of you?

592
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,420
Will he be embarrassed when he remembers it?

593
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,180
He?

594
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,260
Is he so shameless?

595
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,900
I don't believe you. Call him and try.

596
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,380
Done.

597
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,680
Come on.

598
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,760
Don't drink too much.

599
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,980
Really hard.

600
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,120
Next person.

601
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,520
Come on.

602
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,440
Come on.

603
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,240
Hello.

604
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,440
What?

605
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,160
It's okay.

606
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm eating with my friends.

607
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,600
Who are you eating with?

608
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,400
Is there something important?

609
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,440
Don't tell me that you want to hang up?

610
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,800
Why is Chi Shao so polite today?

611
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,040
Exactly.

612
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
He usually hangs up.

613
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,600
Shut up.

614
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,640
What's the matter?

615
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,520
Tell me.

616
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,280
After I went to see you last time,

617
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,160
didn't you tell me

618
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,280
so many valuable things?

619
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,080
I wanted to ask you.

620
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,440
I think...

621
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,200
I hung up.

622
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,640
Again.

623
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes.

624
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
I'll make an apology.

625
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
Go ahead.

626
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,960
K commit suicide?

627
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,560
He delete his name.

628
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Stranger?

629
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,320
No, he's the only person.

630
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,720
Come, come.

631
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,480
Aw, gosh.

632
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,160
She движa it.

633
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,720
That's annoying.

634
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:35,840
What's the color?

635
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,280
其實她是使命才的.

636
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,920
Yes.

637
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,120
I'm ready

638
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,040
to play the game of long-lasting wine.

639
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
Now Chichen and Yueyue

640
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,880
can't be separated for a while.

641
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,400
Why?

642
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,240
Chichen doesn't love Yueyue anymore.

643
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,840
Chichen has a snake.

644
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,880
His snake was caught by his father.

645
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,000
If he wants to keep the snake's life,

646
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,640
he must obey his father's arrangement.

647
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,200
So Chichen's father is satisfied with Yueyue?

648
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,360
You can't say that.

649
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,440
His father thinks

650
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,240
rather than let him be with a man,

651
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,200
as long as it's a woman,

652
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
his father will agree.

653
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,960
Then if Chichen

654
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,240
wants to be with you,

655
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,760
will he give up the snake?

656
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,480
Impossible.

657
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,680
With my little trick with Chichen,

658
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,040
I can never shake the snake

659
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,160
in his heart.

660
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,560
Then it's hard.

661
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,200
It's not that I can't do it.

662
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,040
I plan to

663
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,120
force him to break it.

664
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,640
Force him to break it?

665
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,840
Do you know

666
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,720
what Yueyue is most afraid of?

667
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,480
Snake.

668
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,840
He must hate the little vinegar bag.

669
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,400
He is likely to kill the little vinegar bag.

670
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,120
I just need to get out of this

671
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,480
and lure Yueyue to harm the little vinegar bag.

672
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,120
Then you will get out of here.

673
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,840
Of course.

674
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,840
After all, Er Bao is also our family.

675
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,920
How can I let Yueyue hurt him?

676
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,520
The question is,

677
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,880
how can you lure him?

678
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,160
Use the human heart.

679
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,120
Think about it.

680
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,240
Yueyue must think

681
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,800
she has married into the harem

682
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,080
and can't wait to

683
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,040
get rid of the little vinegar bag.

684
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,640
I just need to add in the last part of the painting

685
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,760
to increase the time

686
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,560
between her and the little vinegar bag.

687
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,360
By then,

688
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,520
she will definitely

689
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
be unable to do anything to the little vinegar bag.

690
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,920
By then,

691
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,560
Chi Cheng will find out

692
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,720
and kick Yueyue away.

693
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,280
Slowly.

694
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,040
Put it down.

695
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,960
It's hurting me.

696
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,680
Little vinegar bag.

697
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,080
Why are you here?

698
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,320
You sweat a lot.

699
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,280
Come.

700
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,960
Stop wiping.

701
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,880
You wipe too much.

702
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,480
There are still people here.

703
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,120
Why are my eyes covered in sand?

704
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,600
She is more embarrassed than you.

705
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,680
Have you seen the price of the tobacco?

706
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,560
Five days.

707
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,720
Six days.

708
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,760
The smoke is not bad.

709
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
Have you sold the snake?

710
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,680
No.

711
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,840
The market is not doing well these days.

712
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,800
The market price is much lower than last year.

713
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,560
I dare not do it.

714
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,680
You really know how to play tricks on me.

715
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
I don't know what kind of market this year.

716
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,920
I know you like to play tricks on me.

717
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,920
This environment is so nice.

718
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,560
Yes.

719
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,640
It's so nice.

720
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,040
You see, we are still friends.

721
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,760
Yes.

722
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,240
Don't move.

723
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,000
I didn't expect it would be autumn.

724
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,240
We broke up for so long.

725
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,280
I cried and cried.

726
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,520
Now I'm going to tell Ai with her current boyfriend.

727
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,320
This world is really crazy.

728
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,320
Build a food marketing department in the company.

729
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,440
Search for food from all over the country.

730
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,720
Send me the ranking and ranking.

731
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,120
When will you send it?

732
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,840
Three days.

733
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,120
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm sorry.

735
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,880
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,720
I'm sorry.

737
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,520
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,520
I'm sorry.

739
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
I'm sorry.

741
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,520
I'm sorry.

742
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,520
I'm sorry.

743
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,520
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
I'm sorry.

745
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
I'm sorry.

746
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,520
I'm sorry.

748
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,520
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,520
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,520
I'm sorry.

754
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,520
I'm sorry.

755
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,520
I'm sorry.

756
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
I'm sorry.

757
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,520
I'm sorry.

758
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
I'm sorry.

759
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,520
I'm sorry.

760
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
I'm sorry.

761
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
I'm sorry.
