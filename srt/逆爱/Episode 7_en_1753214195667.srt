00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
The sm lived in His Majesty's palace as they were searching the hooray distance in бар جنépoque

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,920
Charlie Shen is still in the Critia Susanan

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,220
Originally direction

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,700
with my line.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,760
There's the traditional view by the kiss.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows past my face, it blows through my hair

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And they're telling me a sentence

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The sound of spring is growing, the words are being spoken

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is it all you? It's all you

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The autumn leaves are in full bloom, the four seasons change

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's also you

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's also you

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Actually, there's no need to send me back

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to see if it looks good

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What's so good about it?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's good

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've never seen anything like it

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's a lot

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Say it

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Honey, I miss you so much

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Can you come with me?

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's go

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't let them wait

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I really can't bear to leave

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't forget that you have a snake in your bag

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Who told you that?

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Xiao Gang

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Nonsense

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You should go. I'm going to take a shower

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Great

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's go together

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You have time to spend with me

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Your father doesn't have time to spend with you

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Your father doesn't have time to spend with you

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Go

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I won't

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Go

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Go

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm so confused

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm so confused

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm so confused

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The smoke is good

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Please come in

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mom

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Mom

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mom

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mom

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mom

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Sister

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yueyue is here

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hello, uncle and aunt

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Aunt, this is for you

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I saw it two days ago

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Aomenshimpujing Entertainment City 772772.com

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The most exciting PG game on the line

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The mahjong is over

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The mahjong is over 2

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The prize-winning queen is looking for a golden city

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The talented cat is the gold captain

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And so on

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
High pay rate

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The reward rate is very high

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are a lot of chances to pay

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Join Aomenshimpujing Entertainment City 772772.com

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What do you want to drink?

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't spend much money on my own.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't need to spend money.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Mom, let's eat first.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, let's eat.

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Come.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Come, let's go.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't be so polite, Yue Yue.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't expect Chi Cheng's sister is so hard to deal with.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Who sent this?

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You think you can scare me with a few broken letters?

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've been living a life of a fool for years.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're just a joke.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Even if you want Chi Cheng to be a good girl,

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you can't just ask a woman to marry you.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's good to have a girlfriend like your brother.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yue Yue is a child.

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Although the family conditions are normal,

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
she's still honest.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She looks good.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
She's still honest?

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You didn't see what she looks like.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't talk nonsense.

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You just met her once.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What can you see?

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Miss, do you need anything?

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you want to hear it, come in and listen.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Aunt, Chi Cheng left.

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's a little bit of a problem.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's ignore her and keep eating.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Come and sit.

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Come.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why are you here?

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Are you disappointed that I'm not Chi Cheng?

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Or disappointed that I'm not Yue Yue?

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You know?

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then Chi Cheng...

106
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He doesn't know yet.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But after that,

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
it's not necessarily.

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What do you want?

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I like Jiang Xiao Shuai.

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I want you to help me secretly make up.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Impossible.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How can I let my master jump into the fire pit

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
with a stubborn child like you?

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Jiang Xiao Shuai, how did he become your master?

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I...

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So it was him

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
who helped you make up behind your back.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Aren't you afraid

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that I told Chi Cheng about this

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and ruined your good life?

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I know.

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You won't tell him.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why?

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you tell Chi Cheng

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
about the relationship between us,

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Chi Cheng will keep stealing the person you like.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you really like Jiang Xiao Shuai,

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
you won't take the risk.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I've been sitting for a day.

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My back hurts.

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Xiao Shuai.

133
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Xiao Shuai.

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why are you here?

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's go.

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll take you to massage.

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Forget it.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I have a lot of work to do.

139
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I know there's a professional massage therapist nearby.

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He's much more professional than you.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Master?

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Go away.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Master?

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who's the master?

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Enough.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:32,700
Stop being so

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't threaten my master.

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Xiao Shuai, listen to me.

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This is a matter of life and death.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I won't take this revenge.

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What about Chi Cheng?

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Will he let you go?

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Dawei.

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I really need to find a master.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's go to massage.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't worry.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll go.

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Master, you're good at this.

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Where did you learn it?

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You want to learn?

161
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's simple.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll teach you.

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
First, find the Xie Fang Ji.

165
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Xie Fang Ji.

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
From the top to the bottom.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Mr. Guo.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let him practice.

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I...

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Can you?

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't.

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Come on.

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Come on.

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Slow down.

175
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Find the Xie Fang Ji first.

176
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Xie Fang Ji.

177
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes.

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Go down.

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
From here.

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Come on.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Time.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Then go down.

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
To the shoulder.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
To the shoulder.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

186
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Here.

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Remember this.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You go first.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We'll go first.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go.

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Come on.

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Are you comfortable?

193
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Dr. Jiang is really

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
a good doctor.

196
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You go down.

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I won't serve you.

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You go down if you want to.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This is my bed.

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Your bed is over there.

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll go down.

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay.

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Go.

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Go.

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Go.

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Go.

207
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What's going on?

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You take the price I told you.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Take it.

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll pay you back

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
if you lose money.

212
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes.

213
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The snake eggs that Chi Shao introduced

214
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
must be delicious.

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Chi Shao, take care.

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Take care, Chi Shao.

217
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I found the operator.

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You see,

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
business is not worth it.

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's a waste of money.

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Look,

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
what are you eating?

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yueyue,

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
if you didn't bring me here,

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I wouldn't be here.

226
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's hot and noisy.

227
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I think it's okay here.

228
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I live in a high-speed highway.

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I can't sleep at night.

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's much quieter here.

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's noisy.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think it's better to sleep here.

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's not a good place to sleep.

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's a good place to sleep.

235
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's noisy.

236
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How can you sleep?

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
How about this?

238
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You

239
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
move here.

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So you two

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
can take care of each other.

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yueyue,

243
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm used to living alone.

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You can live alone forever.

245
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You always want to get married and have children.

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm full.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Ignore him.

248
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Listen to me.

249
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You can live here tonight.

250
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Don't come to my car.

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Aunt,

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm so embarrassed.

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What's so embarrassing?

254
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I've already recognized you as my daughter-in-law.

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Aunt, don't worry.

256
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll take care of Chi Cheng for you.

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Good girl.

258
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What are you looking at?

259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, my.

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I forgot to let go of the little bag.

261
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Come on.

262
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Come out and take a breath.

263
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Come on.

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Come on.

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Come on.

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Come on.

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Come on.

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Come on.

269
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Come on.

270
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Come on.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Come on.

272
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Come on.

273
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Come on.

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Come on.

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Come on.

276
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Aunt,

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
are you asleep?

278
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We're about to sleep.

279
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How is he treating you tonight?

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Did you have any conflicts?

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
No.

282
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm fine with Chi Cheng.

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What's wrong?

284
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Nothing.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's good that you didn't have any conflicts.

286
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The company will send Chi Cheng to go on a business trip soon.

287
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You should go with him.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You hold the opportunity yourself.

289
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
His father and I are waiting to have a grandson.

290
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Aunt,

291
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Chi Cheng and I are not married yet.

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You can come back and get married.

293
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
As long as you two have a good relationship,

294
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
nothing else matters.

295
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay, aunt.

296
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I got it.

297
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Chi Cheng and I will do our best.

298
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Then you two finish your work and rest early.

299
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Goodbye, aunt.

300
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Take the medicine three times a day.

302
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Take one gram each time.

303
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm not that kind of person.

304
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't want to do anything.

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm just a little crazy.

306
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't want to be a crazy person.

307
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I want to help him with his job.

308
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What kind of job?

309
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You helped him to catch the bad girl and find the snake nest.

310
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He should do something for you.

311
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But I think

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
you should give him something.

313
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
After all,

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
he has been trying so hard to help you.

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Last quarter's material fee is 60,000 yuan.

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Junior Brother's management fee is 100,000 yuan.

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Plus, it's 170,000 yuan.

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,640
Payment, water bills.

319
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,640
Oh, right.

320
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,120
Last month, I borrowed my mom's 10,000 yuan.

321
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,560
After I add it up,

322
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,160
I'll reduce it to...

323
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,520
30,000 yuan.

324
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
30,000 yuan?

325
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,320
Buy a watch?

326
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,120
I don't have a job now.

327
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,120
I have to save some of my living expenses.

328
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,760
How much do you have

329
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,640
besides living expenses?

330
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,440
Over 5,000 yuan.

331
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,200
A set of clothes?

332
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,320
No.

333
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,840
My mom's birthday is next month.

334
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,320
I have to give her 2,000 yuan.

335
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
It's worth more than 3,000 yuan.

336
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,600
Send her to the police?

337
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,840
No.

338
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,640
I didn't come here last week.

339
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
I hired three temporary workers.

340
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,600
I haven't paid them yet.

341
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,200
To reduce their salary,

342
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
I only have 36 yuan left.

343
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,240
How about

344
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,840
I blow 50 candy for her?

345
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:13,920
No.

346
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,400
It's a bit tiring.

347
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,720
I mean, bro,

348
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,480
the box of cigarettes sent by the government yesterday,

349
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,080
50 of them,

350
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,600
it's 30,000 yuan.

351
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,280
Yeah.

352
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,240
I didn't even think about it.

353
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,240
How about I sell box of cigarettes

354
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,880
and buy her a cigarette lighter?

355
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,520
Cigarette lighter?

356
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,320
I'll kill you with a cigarette lighter.

357
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,960
Give me the account book.

358
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,440
Give it to me.

359
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,880
Why do you need this 100,000 yuan?

360
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,520
You can't touch this 100,000 yuan.

361
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,000
I left it for myself.

362
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,720
но

363
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,240
The footsteps look like

364
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,600
an outcome of government ritual.

365
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,200
Granted.

366
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,140
Y", I

367
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,600
was sitting with my mom and sisters

368
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,560
thinking about what we should do.

369
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,320
I'm not sure if I can tell you

370
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,000
about this.

371
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,520
At this time,

372
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
William Lucas is here.

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,040
Why are you here?

374
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,680
You know I'm here.

375
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,400
Why are you dressed so dirty?

376
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
Don't talk nonsense.

377
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,920
This is a place of civilization.

378
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,680
A place of civilization?

379
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,640
Then may I ask

380
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,520
how to make you so messy?

381
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,880
Who are you talking about?

382
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,080
I'm talking about

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
who is not in love.

384
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,160
I haven't seen you for days.

385
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,280
I miss you so much.

386
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,440
What are you doing?

387
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,440
Let go.

388
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,400
I bought you a gift.

389
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Who believes you?

390
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,680
I'm really done.

391
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,320
Let go.

392
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,000
Okay.

393
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
I really bought it for you.

394
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,480
You tricked me with this thing.

395
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,760
You don't want it.

396
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,680
I don't want to give it to you.

397
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,440
I want it.

398
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,120
Why did you hit me?

399
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,520
Let me try.

400
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,720
Are you crazy?

401
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
It's pretty good.

402
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,480
It's really good.

403
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,880
It's fake.

404
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,880
It's high-end.

405
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,440
That's good.

406
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,880
I haven't used a fake one yet.

407
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,720
Help me tie it.

408
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,280
You don't have hands.

409
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,560
My hands?

410
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,920
How can you have good hands?

411
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,040
Help me tie it.

412
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,720
You're so stubborn.

413
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,520
Turn around.

414
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,200
I don't know how to do it.

415
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,120
Fine.

416
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,760
I'm not leaving today.

417
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,120
Why?

418
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,880
You caught me.

419
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
I'm leaving.

420
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,160
Let go.

421
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,080
Don't say that.

422
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,280
This belt is still quite strong.

423
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,880
You're afraid?

424
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,280
You're afraid of me, right?

425
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,160
Don't be afraid.

426
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,720
Help me.

427
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,640
What are you talking about?

428
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,120
Don't rush me.

429
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,680
You don't let me go up.

430
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,040
And you don't let me sleep comfortably.

431
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,640
I'm not going to sleep.

432
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,480
No.

433
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,280
Tang Bao.

434
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,600
I might have to go on a business trip tomorrow.

435
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,680
I'll go for four or five days.

436
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,600
Go ahead.

437
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,360
I can take a few days off

438
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,800
and do something serious.

439
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,240
Go with my girlfriend.

440
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,120
That's good.

441
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,600
Let's take it as a vacation.

442
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,080
What's wrong with you?

443
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,840
Are you on the street?

444
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,520
I'm fine.

445
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,600
Then turn around and look at me.

446
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,680
What's so good about you?

447
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,960
Shi Cheng.

448
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,120
Don't do this.

449
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,800
You don't like this the most, do you?

450
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,640
You...

451
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,560
Tang Bao.

452
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,240
Anyone can be angry with me.

453
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
But not you.

454
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,840
Why?

455
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,480
Because only when you're angry

456
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
can I be anxious.

457
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,360
And...

458
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,560
I'll do what I have to do.

459
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,120
I'm sending my May Paris smile.

460
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,280
Have you sent him a leave of absence?

461
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,960
Let him be.

462
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,280
He has to find him.

463
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,120
Let him go.

464
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,360
What do you mean?

465
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,960
Let him go.

466
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,960
When a good husband

467
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,400
entre dóndeurers

468
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
are separated,

469
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,720
one can't help but miss his wife.

470
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,080
What did sauce get into that bitch?

471
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,560
We've got

472
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,340
Tay記!

473
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,980
Get on the bullet train now!

474
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,520
Wait for me.

475
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,700
There's no time to focus on police.

476
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,300
Chi Cheng is going on a attaché.

477
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,380
Yue started to go as well.

478
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,820
Are you jealous of him?

479
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,820
Why should I be?

480
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,260
She wanted to marry Yueyue right away.

481
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,780
She thought she could bring back Chichen.

482
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,100
You're so clever.

483
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,580
You're trying to stimulate Yueyue

484
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,620
and Chichen's mother.

485
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,700
You're trying to make them both happy.

486
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,180
Yes.

487
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,420
The later they come back, the better.

488
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,380
The later, the more Yueyue

489
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,860
hates the existence of the little pig.

490
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,380
Since Yueyue has already thought

491
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,780
she's the daughter-in-law of the Ch family,

492
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,660
she'll act as if she's always

493
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,300
the sweetest.

494
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,540
When she comes back,

495
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,220
she'll definitely attack the little pig.

496
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,060
So,

497
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,780
you want Yueyue and Chichen

498
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,980
to stay with her for a while longer, right?

499
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
Of course.

500
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,260
I'm going to the market.

501
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
The market is about to open.

502
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,620
I want to rely on my second spring.

503
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,620
I'm leaving.

504
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,340
Let's go.

505
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,940
Wait a minute.

506
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,420
So choose this.

507
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,420
Did you book the hotel?

508
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,220
Yes.

509
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,860
The business suite is here.

510
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,260
If you don't want to sleep in a bed with him,

511
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,700
you can come out and sleep on the sofa.

512
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,020
You know me best.

513
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,700
Oh, right.

514
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,900
About the snake,

515
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,540
Fei Wu Suowei told me.

516
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,780
He asked about it himself.

517
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,620
I just answered him.

518
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,380
I didn't tell him about the progress.

519
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,540
Okay.

520
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,220
If he asks about the snake,

521
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,660
don't tell him.

522
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,060
I'm afraid he'll worry.

523
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,740
It's okay tonight.

524
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,620
Go to bed early.

525
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,260
Okay.

526
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,380
Surprise.

527
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,580
What?

528
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,100
I didn't see anything.

529
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,300
Here's the suitcase.

530
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,540
Did he leave?

531
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,980
Yes.

532
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,980
Your mom said

533
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,140
they'll meet in two days.

534
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,900
Then we'll settle down.

535
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
Shall we come tonight?

536
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,580
What?

537
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,460
Didn't he come with you?

538
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,220
We came by car.

539
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,180
What's wrong?

540
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,820
I'll take a shower first.

541
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,060
What's wrong?

542
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,460
I...

543
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
I had a nightmare.

544
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,420
I dreamed you abandoned me.

545
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,460
Don't worry.

546
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,180
I won't abandon you.

547
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,020
You're so nice.

548
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,300
I'll go to sleep.

549
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,900
Go to sleep.

550
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,420
One day,

551
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,820
I'll kill you.

552
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,180
Come on. This way.

553
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,060
Let me show you.

554
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,700
Boss.

555
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,060
Where's the snake area?

556
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,860
This way.

557
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,500
Come on.

558
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,540
Up here.

559
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,420
Look.

560
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,300
It's worth it.

561
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,700
YourGaryía.

562
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,980
Thank you.

563
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:08,820
Boss.

564
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,380
You're bad at snakes.

565
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,340
It shows you're an expert.

566
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,420
Come over.

567
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,300
Let me show you this.

568
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,180
Where did you get this snake?

569
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Don't ask me about this.

570
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
I won't lie to you.

571
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,180
I wouldn't dare to sell it.

572
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,180
If it's wild,

573
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
if I can't raise it,

574
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
I'll just waste it.

575
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
Put your heart in your stomach.

576
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
I guarantee that it's all grown.

577
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,180
Grown?

578
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,180
Who has the ability to grow

579
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,180
so many precious snakes?

580
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,180
It must be a miscreant.

581
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
It must be a miscreant.

582
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,180
Young man,

583
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,180
are you really planning to buy it?

584
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,180
I was planning to buy it.

585
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,180
Seeing you so excited,

586
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
I really can't stop thinking about it.

587
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Forget it.

588
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,180
Wait a minute!

589
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,180
I'll be back.

590
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,180
Come back.

591
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,180
You're forcing me to tell the truth.

592
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
What do you mean by forcing?

593
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
You're the one who should buy it.

594
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,180
If you can't get it,

595
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,180
you dare to buy it?

596
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Come on. I'll tell you.

597
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,180
Do you have any clues about the snake?

598
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
Yes.

599
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,180
Then you can tell Chi Cheng about it directly.

600
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
Let him solve it himself.

601
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,180
Anyway,

602
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,180
he's using Yue Yue to convince his father.

603
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
If he finds it himself,

604
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,180
Yue Yue will have no use for it.

605
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,180
No.

606
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,180
Why?

607
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,180
Think about it.

608
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,180
If I tell Chi Cheng the truth,

609
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,180
Chi Cheng will definitely try to

610
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,180
get the snake back.

611
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
Then,

612
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
the conflict between Chi Cheng and his father will get worse.

613
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Chi Cheng and his father?

614
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
The snake will be a victim of black hand again.

615
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,180
A victim of black hand?

616
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,180
I think we should help him in secret.

617
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,180
In this case,

618
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,180
we can get the snake back,

619
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
and we can also push Li Kui's side to his father.

620
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
It's a good chance.

621
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,180
It doesn't matter.

622
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,180
Do you want them to break up?

623
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,180
Or do you want to be with him?

624
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,180
Nonsense.

625
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,180
They must break up.

626
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Then,

627
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,180
why are you so worried about the snake?

628
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,180
You're here to take revenge.

629
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Not to save the snake.

630
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Then,

631
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,180
I'm doing this for the good of the people.

632
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,180
Think about it.

633
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,180
I've been planning Chi Cheng so many times.

634
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,180
Now,

635
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,180
I finally have a chance to make up for it.

636
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
I can make up for it.

637
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,180
Then, do you plan to do it?

638
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,180
Do it?

639
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Why not?

640
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,180
Think about it.

641
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,180
When the time comes, Yue Yue and Chi Cheng will break up.

642
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Chi Cheng?

643
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Yue Yue will definitely complain to Chi Cheng's mother.

644
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Chi Cheng's mother will definitely

645
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,180
be angry with Chi Cheng.

646
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
Chi Cheng will also

647
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,180
feel pain in Yue Yue's body.

648
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,180
She will cut off Yue Yue's back.

649
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,180
I seriously suspect that

650
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,180
your love rival has changed.

651
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,180
It's so hot today.

652
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,180
Okay.

653
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,180
Let's talk about the actual thing.

654
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,180
How do you plan to

655
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,180
transport that snake from the inside of the company?

656
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,180
Just like this.

657
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Isn't this the brand that Chi Cheng often wears?

658
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,180
I'll go in and take a look.

659
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,180
I definitely won't buy it.

660
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,180
I will definitely

661
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,180
return it from Chi Cheng's side.

662
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
