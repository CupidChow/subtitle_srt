1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
Then, bye-bye.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows through my face and blows through my hair

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They're telling me something

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The spring breeze blows and the flowers bloom

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is it all you?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's all you

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The autumn leaves are in full bloom

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The four seasons change

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's the same with you

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's the same with you

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 2

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What are you doing?

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're not that nervous

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What is this?

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Could it be...

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What is this?

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What is this?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What is this?

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What is this?

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What is this?

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What is this?

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What is this?

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What is this?

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What is this?

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000

What is this?

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What is this?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What is this?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What is this?

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What is this?

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What is this?

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is this?

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What is this?

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What is this?

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What is this?

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What is this?

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What is this?

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What is this?

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This...

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This...

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,080
Let's go.

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,800
Let's have breakfast.

75
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
Let me help you up.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,640
No.

The end.

92
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,520
To you slowly.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,600
Have breakfast.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,920
For now,

95
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,000
you're about to go first.

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,880
Get yourself together first.

97
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,560
Go, go, go.

98
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,760
I'll get you some breakfast.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm afraid you can't take it anymore.

100

Here.

101
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
Try this.

102
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,800
Tonight...

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,520
Tonight...

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,240
I want to go home and have a look.

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
My mom misses me.

106
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,240
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,960
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,720
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,400
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,560
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,320
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,120
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,880
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,320
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,360
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,720
Please.

123
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,600
Please.

125
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,280
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
My mom really misses me.

129
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
Alright.

130
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,960
Then after you finish breakfast,

131
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,800
I will send you back.

132
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,560
No need.

133
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I can go back on my own.

134
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,920
I'm OK.

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,800
Yes.

136
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,000
Master, answer the phone.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,120
I miss you so much.

138
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,760
I want to communicate with you.

139
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,520
What are you doing?

140
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,240
No.

141
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
I have to find him.

142
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,760
Yes.

143
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,440
What's wrong with you?

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,880
Nothing.

145
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,480
Where is Dr. Shuai?

146
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
He haven't gone out for days.

147
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,760
He hasn't gone out for days?

148
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,480
Where did he go?

149
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,920
When I went to a private room,

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,560
He said he hasn't been back for days.

151
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,680
He came here in the middle of the night.

152
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,680
One night, at two o'clock,

153
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,480
he was standing at the door of the clinic alone.

154
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
At first, I thought he was a thief.

155
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,360
He was so strict.

156
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,960
But he was Jiang Yisheng himself.

157
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,240
Came in the middle of the night?

158
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
He's going to sing a song.

159
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,560
You can even make desserts?

160
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,240
I made the supper you had last night.

161
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,960
So you made yourself so capable.

162
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,280
Is it for playing with men?

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,880
My parents wanted a daughter since I was a kid.

164
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,120
But they only had me.

165
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,280
So since I was a kid,

166
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,640
they treated me as a daughter.

167
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,200
They wanted me to learn

168
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,120
the art of painting and painting.

169
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,920
You always think you're a girl.

170
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,720
Do you believe

171
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,400
I can make you feel what a man is?

172
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,680
You're so cute.

173
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,040
You're quite interesting.

174
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
In the past,

175
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,400
no one has ever eaten what I made.

176
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,320
Who?

177
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,920
Their later boyfriends.

178
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,560
Chi Cheng?

179
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,240
Yes.

180
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,160
It seems you care about him.

181
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,960
Of course I do.

182
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,600
We grew up together.

183
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,680
Wait.

184
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,240
He's coming to the door.

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,720
Don't tell him I live here.

186
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,280
Please. Don't.

187
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
Okay.

188
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,840
What do you want me to do today?

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,120
I'll talk to him later.

190
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I can't fight with you.

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,640
Come back tomorrow.

192
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,200
Yubi,

193
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,820
I want the punishment too.

194
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:31,540
Myус

195
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,420
I see there is catfish in the tea

196
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,260
On the other hand

197
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,420
You are free

198
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,140
The bomb is bomb

199
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,420
See

200
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,460
I'm afraid

201
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,580
I feel a little sick

202
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,900
I'm fine

203
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,780
I also haven't had a fever

204
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,620
you

205
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,820
How about eating

206
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,460
Like a lamb

207
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,500
Look, eat

208
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,940
Recезде

209
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,500
good

210
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,020
I'm naval

211
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,980
In the morning, she's really cute.

212
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,020
Okay.

213
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,740
All right.

214
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,420
So close.

215
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,560
He's so beautiful now.

216
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,800
He's retired,

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,900
I 좋아요.

218
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,560
But I need...

219
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,280
some alien friends to work with.

220
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,020
ends to be upset.

221
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,780
I still have no experience.

222
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,220
I suddenly miss my mom.

223
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,500
I want to spend another day with her.

224
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,060
You're right.

225
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,820
It's been a long time since you went back.

226
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,420
I'll go back with you.

227
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,740
No.

228
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,220
My mom will be suspicious

229
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,420
when you go back.

230
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,340
What's the meaning of that?

231
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,300
I'm afraid that she'll smell

232
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,260
the smell of my sleeping on you.

233
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,180
Nonsense.

234
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

235
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,140
Xiaoshuai, why haven't you come back yet?

236
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,900
I've been waiting for you for three and a half days.

237
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,860
You're back in secret.

238
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,100
And you didn't turn on the light.

239
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,340
Master.

240
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,980
You rejected me for two nights

241
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,100
just to hug her, right?

242
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,780
Why are you here?

243
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,900
You're disappointed, right?

244
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,900
No.

245
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,500
No.

246
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,460
What are you doing?

247
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,220
Don't move.

248
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,260
Don't move.

249
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,500
Why isn't the door closed?

250
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,860
Is there a thief?

251
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,260
You...

252
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,620
You dare to steal my stuff.

253
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,060
You don't want to live, do you?

254
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,220
I'll fight you.

255
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
You're still here.

256
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
You want to go together?

257
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,060
No.

258
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,300
Excuse me.

259
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,820
You guys go on.

260
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,100
You guys go on.

261
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,500
Why am I so unlucky?

262
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,860
Why do I always meet them?

263
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,460
They...

264
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,420
They've...

265
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,540
Oh, no.

266
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,220
I'm so ashamed to meet my master.

267
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,220
Good.

268
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,500
Go back and clean up.

269
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,940
Take our house out.

270
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,180
But we'll meet again.

271
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,820
My man's eyes.

272
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,420
Your man's eyes

273
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,060
are reflected by him at the private meeting at night, right?

274
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,020
You think I came to him at night?

275
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,940
He's been hiding from me.

276
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,660
You keep asking.

277
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
He hasn't been out for days.

278
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,500
I can only stay here at night.

279
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,940
How long haven't you contacted each other?

280
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,780
A week.

281
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,740
Sixth day.

282
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
What sixth day?

283
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,300
Nothing.

284
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,460
Give me your phone.

285
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,940
What are you doing?

286
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,340
I'll help you move back.

287
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,940
What do you mean?

288
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,940
Master.

289
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,980
Actually, Guo Chen Yu knew it long ago.

290
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,340
Guo Chen Yu.

291
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,860
Come out.

292
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,780
Guo Chen Yu.

293
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
Open the door.

294
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,220
What?

295
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,100
What's wrong?

296
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,900
What's wrong?

297
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,740
What's wrong?

298
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Say it.

299
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,220
Why are you here?

300
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,860
You should wear something like this.

301
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,620
I've just finished the bath.

302
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,900
It's normal.

303
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,180
Why did you come so late to me?

304
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,980
Say it.

305
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,100
Nothing.

306
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,500
Well...

307
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm leaving first.

308
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,740
I have something to tell you.

309
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,240
By the way,

310
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
I found something interesting

311
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
in your cabinet.

312
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
For example,

313
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,240
this love-struck necklace.

314
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,740
I like it very much.

315
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,240
Give it to me.

316
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,740
No.

317
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,240
Give it to me.

318
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,740
No.

319
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,240
Give it to me.

320
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,740
No.

321
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,240
No.

322
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,740
No.

323
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,240
No.

324
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,740
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,740
I didn't mean to do that.

326
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,740
No.

327
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
Meng Cha.

328
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Meng Cha.

329
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,740
Meng Cha.

330
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
Don't do this.

331
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,740
Why are you doing this to me?

332
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,740
Meng Cha.

333
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Meng Cha.

334
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
I said...

335
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,740
Meng Cha.

336
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
I said...

337
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
I said...

338
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
I said...

339
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Don't do this.

340
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,740
Don't do this.

341
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
Don't do this.

342
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,740
Don't do this.

343
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Don't do this.

344
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,740
I feel a little pain in my head.

345
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
But I'm not uncomfortable.

346
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Aunt.

347
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
Aunt, what's wrong?

348
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,740
Are you not feeling well?

349
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
I'm fine.

350
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
I often do this.

351
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Chi.

352
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,740
Why are you free today?

353
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
I bought you some supplements.

354
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
I'll send them to you.

355
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
You always bring things with you.

356
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Okay.

357
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Let's talk inside.

358
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
Aunt.

359
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
Let's go.

360
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,740
I'll take you to the hospital.

361
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
Let's go.

362
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
No need.

363
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Just take some medicine.

364
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,740
Just take some medicine.

365
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Take some medicine.

366
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Take care.

367
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
So...

368
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,740
You've been staying with Guo Chengyu these days?

369
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,740
Guo Chengyu is a thug.

370
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
If it wasn't for him,

371
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
I would have completed the task.

372
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,740
He even told me that you two didn't sleep.

373
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
So I only dared to stay with him.

374
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
Task?

375
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
What task?

376
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,740
You still don't know?

377
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
Forget it.

378
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
I'll tell you the truth.

379
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,740
Chi Cheng gave me the last pass.

380
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
He told me that you must sleep with him

381
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
within five days.

382
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Otherwise,

383
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
I'll be the one who's unlucky.

384
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,740
I didn't finish the task.

385
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,740
I dare not contact you.

386
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
It's okay.

387
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
Chi Cheng made you trick me?

388
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,740
Dawei.

389
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
Are you mad at me?

390
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
It's okay.

391
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,740
You can't be blamed for this.

392
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
After all, you were forced to do it.

393
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,740
I can't take it either.

394
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
I'm just a ghost.

395
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
How could I be tricked easily?

396
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
We are just little oil bars.

397
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Chi Cheng is just a big oil bar.

398
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,740
Like Guo Chengyu,

399
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
he's just an old oil cake.

400
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,740
Do you think

401
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,740
I should take this opportunity

402
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,740
to directly make him understand

403
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,740
my purpose of approaching him?

404
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
In this way,

405
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,740
he will apologize to me

406
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
and admit my fault.

407
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
It's a deal.

408
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,740
This is a good opportunity.

409
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
Besides this heart disease,

410
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
you have no worries at all.

411
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
These days,

412
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,740
you two didn't have

413
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
to stay at Guo Chengyu's house.

414
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
Don't think too much.

415
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Nothing happened.

416
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,740
Actually,

417
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
I think

418
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,740
Guo Chengyu doesn't like me.

419
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
You asked him for the snake.

420
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,740
He gave it to you without saying anything.

421
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
I was hurt.

422
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
He didn't rush to grab the snake.

423
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,740
Instead, he accompanied you

424
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
to send me to the hospital.

425
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Can't this prove that he likes you?

426
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
He gave me the snake I wanted

427
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
because he knew

428
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
I was trying to save Chi Cheng's snake.

429
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
He sent you to the hospital

430
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,740
because he was afraid that Chi Cheng would be anxious.

431
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
Look.

432
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
It's obvious that

433
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,740
he doesn't like me.

434
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,740
What do you want to say?

435
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
I think

436
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,740
Guo Chengyu likes Chi Cheng.

437
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
The snakes I wanted

438
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
were rare.

439
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
Chi Cheng has them.

440
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,740
Guo Chengyu has them.

441
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
And they are all

442
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
the snakes of Chi Cheng.

443
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,740
Listen.

444
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,740
As long as Chi Cheng has snakes,

445
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,740
Guo Shao has the copy.

446
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Shut up.

447
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Do you know why?

448
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,740
Also,

449
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,740
don't you think

450
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,740
their relationship

451
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
is a little strange?

452
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
Strange?

453
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
What's wrong?

454
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,740
They had a seven-year conflict

455
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,740
because of Wang Shuo.

456
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
But have you heard that

457
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
someone has been looking for Wang Shuo

458
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,740
in these seven years?

459
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
Chi Cheng didn't have him

460
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,740
because he hated him.

461
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,740
But why didn't Guo Chengyu have him?

462
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,740
It seems to be true.

463
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
If Guo Chengyu really likes Wang Shuo,

464
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,740
then they should have been together.

465
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
That's the problem.

466
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Not only did he not

467
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
have Wang Shuo,

468
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
he also wanted

469
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,740
to fight Chi Cheng for various reasons.

470
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,740
So you think

471
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
Guo Chengyu likes Chi Cheng?

472
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
Not only that,

473
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
I also noticed that

474
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,740
on the day of the snake fight,

475
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740
Guo Chengyu and Chi Cheng

476
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
fought together.

477
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
It was Chi Cheng who was in the upper line.

478
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,740
When he wanted to fight

479
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
Guo Chengyu,

480
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,740
why couldn't he

481
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,740
fight back?

482
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
No.

483
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,740
Why did Chi Cheng

484
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,740
have to fight back?

485
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,740
What do you want to say?

486
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,740
I think

487
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,740
Chi Cheng also likes

488
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
Guo Chengyu.

489
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Young Master,

490
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,740
Chi Cheng and me...

491
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
I understand.

492
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
You just want to prove

493
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
that the person Guo Chengyu likes

494
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
is not you.

495
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
That's why you

496
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
have such a big brain.

497
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
Your thoughts are flying to the sky.

498
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,740
That's because you are very shallow.

499
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,740
You will know it later.

500
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
Here.

501
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,740
Drink some milk.

502
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
Don't be stubborn.

503
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,740
I'm not stubborn.

504
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
I'm just a little bit stubborn.

505
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Chi Cheng,

506
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
thank you for

507
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
spending so much time

508
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
with me in the hospital.

509
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
Aunt,

510
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
you don't have to be so polite.

511
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
I'm Da Qiong's colleague.

512
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
It's my duty to help.

513
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
Here, have a seat.

514
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Chi Cheng,

515
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
let me ask you.

516
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
Is Da Qiong's

517
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
performance in the company

518
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
good?

519
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,740
Yes.

520
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,740
Drink some water, Aunt.

521
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,740
Our boss

522
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
likes him very much.

523
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,740
Da Qiong is an honest person.

524
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,740
He doesn't have any tricks.

525
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
In this society,

526
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
honest people can't make a lot of money.

527
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
They can only eat.

528
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
Da Qiong of your family

529
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,740
has changed a lot.

530
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
Chi Cheng,

531
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,740
have you been in love?

532
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
Yes.

533
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
A young man like you

534
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
is the most attractive.

535
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,740
You dare to say and do.

536
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
Unlike Da Qiong,

537
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,740
he has been in love with his girlfriend for three years.

538
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
He even broke up with her.

539
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
Do you think

540
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
I'm anxious?

541
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,740
He has been in love with his girlfriend for three years?

542
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,740
Yes.

543
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
Look.

544
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
Da Qiong sent me

545
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
their photo together.

546
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
Let me show you.

547
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,740
Why can't I find it?

548
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
Aunt,

549
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
the photo is not important.

550
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
They have been talking for so long.

551
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
Why did they break up?

552
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,740
Da Qiong told me

553
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,740
that they have a bad temper.

554
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
I know it very well.

555
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
The young lady

556
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
thinks that we are poor.

557
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,740
That time,

558
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,740
they had already talked about marriage.

559
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
The young lady had already

560
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
walked to the door of the house.

561
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
And then she went back.

562
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
Since then,

563
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Da Qiong

564
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,740
never mentioned him to me.

565
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Aunt,

566
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
it's all in the past.

567
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
Don't think about it.

568
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
Right.

569
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
These medicines.

570
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
This one.

571
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,740
Three times a day.

572
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
This one is two times a day.

573
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,740
They are all after meals.

574
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,740
Then you have a good rest.

575
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
I'm leaving.

576
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
Okay. Thank you.

577
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
It's okay, aunt.

578
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,740
Don't bother me.

579
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
I remember

580
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,740
Da Qiong did give me a photo.

581
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,740
It's here.

582
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
You can take the medicine

583
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
according to this.

584
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
Just follow the doctor I prescribed.

585
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
Dr. Jiang.

586
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Zhuang.

587
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
I brought you some fruits.

588
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,740
How is it?

589
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,740
Not bad, right?

590
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,740
Look.

591
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
There is no trace left.

592
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,740
That's good.

593
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
Take care of yourself.

594
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,740
Don't think about being a jerk anymore.

595
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
What are you talking about?

596
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,740
I'll go wash some fruits first.

597
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
Don't.

598
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Dr. Jiang.

599
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Why are you shy?

600
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,740
Who?

601
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Who is shy?

602
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
You have a bad eye.

603
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Yes.

604
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,740
I didn't play the thunder.

605
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
If you have a bad eye,

606
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,740
go to the big hospital.

607
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,740
Don't look at me.

608
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
Do you know how much I've been thinking about it?

609
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,740
I thought your old lover was back.

610
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,740
I feel so bad.

611
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm the one who is evil.

612
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,740
I'm sorry.

613
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
I thought you were a man.

614
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,740
You were so bold.

615
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
I didn't expect you to be so hypocritical.

616
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
You even tried to trick me, right?

617
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,740
Don't you have a time to lie?

618
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Everyone makes mistakes.

619
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
Okay.

620
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,740
I admit that I approached you

621
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
because of Yueyue.

622
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
Enough.

623
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
We're even.

624
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
When she comes back,

625
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,740
I'll officially punish her.

626
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,740
When she's not in her place,

627
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,740
I'll make her understand my purpose.

628
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
This way,

629
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,740
I can show off my boldness

630
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,740
and be a brave man.

631
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,740
That's it.

632
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
I'll go to the bathroom.

633
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
I'll go to the bathroom.

634
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
I'll go to the bathroom.

635
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
That's it.

636
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
What's the pose?

637
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,740
Have you eaten?

638
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,740
No.

639
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,740
I'm eating.

640
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Great.

641
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
I bought some food downstairs.

642
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Eat while it's hot.

643
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,740
No.

644
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,740
You don't eat if you like it.

645
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
I'm eating.

646
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
No.

647
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,740
I'm starting to get emotional.

648
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,740
Here.

649
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,740
Say,

650
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
try this on.

651
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
When did you buy it?

652
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,740
When I was buying clothes for my mother today,

653
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,940
I bought another one.

654
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,020
I didn't buy it long ago.

655
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,420
I had to buy it today.

656
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,980
I finally got some money.

657
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,340
With this love token,

658
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,700
you're going to blow me away again.

659
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,140
My heart is too weak.

660
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,860
Is it done?

661
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,020
Yes.

662
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,060
Not bad.

663
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,340
It's quite suitable.

664
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,700
Okay.

665
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,820
Don't take it off.

666
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,900
Just wear it like this.

667
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,620
It looks so good.

668
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,340
My taste is really good.

669
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,740
What are you doing?

670
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,780
Have you seen Xiao Shuai?

671
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,660
Yes.

672
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,420
He told you

673
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,780
that I asked him to persuade you.

674
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,980
Convince?

675
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,780
It's not a persuasion.

676
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,780
It's a trap.

677
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,420
So you think I'm a person

678
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,260
who doesn't take any measures

679
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,500
to achieve my goal, right?

680
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,420
Yes.

681
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,580
You said you were patient with me.

682
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,140
You said that I would never

683
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,060
recommend you

684
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,660
or force me to do anything.

685
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,660
But you threatened Jiang Xiao Shuai secretly

686
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,100
and forced her to force me to do something.

687
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,900
You're a fool.

688
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,140
I thought you were a man

689
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,460
who was cruel and heartless.

690
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,060
But I didn't expect you to be so hypocritical.

691
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,060
Do you know

692
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,540
how hard I've been struggling these days?

693
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,460
I thought your old lover was coming back.

694
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,020
Do you know how sad I've been these days?

695
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,220
You used such a fierce method to stimulate me

696
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,140
and put all my happiness

697
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,900
on top of my pain.

698
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,980
Now I'm so upset.

699
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,540
I shouldn't have

700
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,860
reminded you of Jiang Xiao Shuai's words.

701
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,460
I shouldn't have been so rude to you.

702
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,220
But...

703
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,700
You're so comfortable being told that.

704
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,900
You can't take it anymore, right?

705
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,060
Come if you dare.

706
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,020
Say dirty words.

707
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,140
Say it loudly.

708
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,060
You can show your true colors after you say it.

709
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
I admit

710
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,140
it's all my fault.

711
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,940
I was too anxious.

712
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,740
I was afraid I'd be with you for too long.

713
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,860
I don't know where you're going with your thoughts.

714
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,620
I asked Jiang Xiao Shuai

715
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,420
because he knows you best.

716
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,300
That's why I used this method.

717
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,580
Of course,

718
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,300
I used some tough methods

719
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,380
and I felt uncomfortable.

720
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,540
Why didn't you play the game as planned?

721
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,620
How could I have said anything about Yue Yue?

722
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,380
I was too honest with her.

723
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,020
Would it have been worse than Wang Shuo?

724
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,140
Are you still mad at me?

725
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,740
Do you still hate Wang Shuo?

726
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,340
Why are you mentioning him?

727
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,660
Do you care about him?

728
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,020
I've said it before.

729
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,500
I care about the past.

730
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,340
Not him.

731
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,780
What if

732
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,020
he comes back to explain it to you?

733
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,700
Will you forgive him?

734
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,740
No.

735
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,660
But what if he really has his reasons?

736
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,140
It's all in the past.

737
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,940
I'm honest.

738
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,140
I'm not a coward.

739
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,260
I hate being lied to the most.

740
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,900
I... I did lie to you a lot.

741
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,700
But you didn't do anything to me.

742
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,700
In the range I can control,

743
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,180
your lies are not called lies.

744
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,460
They're just little tricks.

745
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,940
But if you keep me in the dark

746
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,540
beyond my control,

747
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,660
that's the real meaning of lying.

748
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,220
What's wrong?

749
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,620
What?

750
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,540
You lied to me?

751
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,340
How?

752
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,940
Actually,

753
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
I had a purpose

754
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,740
to approach you.

755
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,100
What purpose?

756
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,180
Life supplies.

757
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,700
The time I became yours is actually

758
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,240
08. têm.

759
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,340
What now?

760
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,660
But, master.

761
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,700
Does the fragrant course you mentioned

762
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,900
really work?

763
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,340
Let me buy you one.

764
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:53,340
High rate of compensation, high rate of reward, high reward opportunities, hurry up to join the Macau New Peking Entertainment City 772772.com

765
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:20,340
I want to tell you

766
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,340
No fear of the stars or the mountains

767
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,340
The sun rises and sets in my eyes

768
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:43,340
Waiting for you to stop without fear of time

769
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,340
The last night on earth

770
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,340
I just want to confess to you

771
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,340
With a heart to pass the final stage

772
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Maybe no regrets

773
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,340
The last night on earth

774
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,340
When life turns into dust

775
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,340
The moment the sea water kisses the sky

776
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:45,340
I will hold you and leave without hesitation
