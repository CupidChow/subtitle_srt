Episode 13

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows through my face and blows through my hair

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They're telling me something

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The spring breeze blows and the flowers bloom

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is it all you?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's all you

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The autumn leaves are in full bloom

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The four seasons change

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's the same with you

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's the same with you

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 2

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's true

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I should have found the new flowers

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's good

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can be more quiet from now on

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Master

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Tao Wei

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Master, you're out of the hospital now?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You recovered so fast

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If I don't leave the hospital

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll poison the nutritious food

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is it that bad?

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Look

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it handsome?

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's so good

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's so good

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's so good

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's so good

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's so good

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's so good

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's so good

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's so good

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's very handsome

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But it's not cheap

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Where did you get the money?

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I bought a second-hand car

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It only cost 50,000

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's so cheap

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Buy me a second one

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What I said is really unnecessary

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's get in the car

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll take you around

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
OK

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OK

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're good

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Successful revenge

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're so good

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Planned for so long

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's like breaking Yue Yue's dream

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not happy

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But you really want to

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Start a company with Chicheng?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's a good deal

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Just think of it as starting a fund

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The overnight license has come down

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The company is almost renovated

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The employees are all looking for me

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're in the hospital

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Nothing is delayed

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
These things

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's all Chicheng's fault

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm just asking for advice

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The plan you made at the beginning

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is to let him chase you

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I didn't expect him to do this for you now

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It was the beginning

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now is now

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Anyway, Yue Yue and Chichen have broken up

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Our goal has been achieved

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then I and Chicheng

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Will only be simple business partners

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Not in love

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Look at what you said

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Fools

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm a straight man

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to be in love with women

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Marry

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
With a man

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not going to be a man

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm not going to be a man

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What's the point of being in love and getting married

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's the point of being with a man

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You ask yourself

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do you have feelings for him

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay, I admit

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I do have feelings for him

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But I can't be with him

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
why

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Two people who like each other

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How can you not be together

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If I'm really with him

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I must be the one who was hurt

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can't stand it

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Macau New Beijing Entertainment City 772772

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Kong

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The most exciting PG game on the line

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The mahjong is over

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The mahjong is over

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The prize-winning queen

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Search for the golden city

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:29,280
The

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
President Wu

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is the design of various lighting instruments in the future

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can leave it to our company to do

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Come and introduce to you

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is our director

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hello, President Wu

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Please cooperate more in the future

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
it is good

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The space above

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I may have to change it again

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I think I'm in Lian Rui

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't think I've seen it

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That project

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't even know myself

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm so nervous

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is the first time I've seen it

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm so nervous

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Such a big company

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
President Wu, you worked hard

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
it is good

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Nothing

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Come, President Wu

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let me introduce you

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He is so stubborn

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is my friend, Director Yu

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hello, hello

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Please cooperate

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Our President Wu is young

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a good thing, right?

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go up and have a look

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
it is good

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That project

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know which hand President Wu is holding

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sorry, excuse me

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
it is good

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Old oil bar

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You said you were starting a business before

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't expect to really open the company

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I hope it's a good start

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You look pretty in a suit

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How do you bend this collar?

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No need

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can do it myself

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Just bend it

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You've changed a lot

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's okay

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I left you

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's not because I lost my sight

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I know

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He doesn't love me

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I broke up with him

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I know

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So you know

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So you care about me so much

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Because he's already with me

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What did you say

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This company

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He and I opened it together

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
How is that possible

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
How can you two

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How can you two be so big

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your name card

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I bought it for you

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What are you talking about

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Have fun

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's really fun

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How did they

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't touch me

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm not a man

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I serve the boss

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why is he here

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't have to ask you that

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I didn't

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Mr. Wu

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Mr. Shi

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Come on

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Come on

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Mr. Shi, I'll go first

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come on

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why are you drinking so much

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What's wrong

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What's wrong with drinking

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I can't bear to love you

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why can't you bear to love

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We won't separate

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But we don't have

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The reason to stay together

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't believe in feelings

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Do you believe

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Killed by feelings

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't believe

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't believe

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're really drunk

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What are you doing

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Put me down

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm going to throw up

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Stand up

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll call you

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Wait for me

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't go

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can't bear to leave you

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not leaving

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let go

212
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Stand up

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll stay with you for a night

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I've been with you

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I've been with you

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then I'll sing for you

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
OK, you sing

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The sun rises and sets in my eyes

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Waiting for you to stop

220
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
In the world

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The last night on earth

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I just want to confess to you

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
With a heart

224
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Pass the end of the world

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Maybe there is no regret

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The last night on earth

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
When life becomes love

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I want to kiss the sky

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I will hold you and leave

230
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I want to kiss the sky

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will hold you and leave

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I want to kiss the sky

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I will hold you and leave

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I want to kiss the sky

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I will hold you and leave

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I want to kiss the sky

240
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will hold you and leave

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I want to kiss the sky

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I will hold you and leave

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I want to kiss the sky

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I will hold you and leave

247
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I saw it

248
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Now there are so many things in the company

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't have time to think about these

250
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The workplace

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I've been on a business trip these days

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've been sending messages about work for a few days

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They didn't make it clear

254
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I was thinking about it

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Can't you take the initiative?

256
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're anxious

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You worry about your own business

258
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What can I do?

259
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's just the hospital number in the clinic

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And the mess with the neighbors

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What about your life?

262
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm a single man

263
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm happy to be alone

264
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Guo Chengyu

265
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Did he bother you recently?

266
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's already a missing person

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Not supposed

268
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now Chi Shen and Yueyue have broken up

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I and Chi Shen are so close now

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Guo Chengyu shouldn't be more at ease to chase you

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why is there no movement?

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
His family is rich

273
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The people around him are hard

274
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm just a joy to him

275
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Xiaoshuai

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ask you something

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Ask

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Chi Shen can be fired, right?

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Can he still be fired after being fired?

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm afraid not

281
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why?

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Look

283
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If he is fired again, he will be a snake

284
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Mr. Shi

285
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
s

286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Xiaoshuai

287
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can bend up with a white paper

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's a disease

289
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's called YAV

290
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It can be turned formally through an operation

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Really

292
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,120
You're nice.

294
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,600
What are you doing?

295
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,680
Shifu.

296
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,800
I think men and women can be a girl and have boys.

297
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,880
You can check if your partner is 와ed up.

298
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,440
I found out it's useless after my partner has changed a corner.

299
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,560
Jiang Xiaoshan is your master?

300
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,720
My friend made a fake one.

301
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,040
Does your master teach you how do the Chicago practice?

302
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,200
You're going crazy view.

303
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
You think I'm blind?

304
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
She's a crooked person.

305
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
You're talking to her about this.

306
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Is she looking for trouble?

307
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
No.

308
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
What are you doing?

309
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
What are you doing?

310
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Tell me.

311
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
How many times have you talked to her?

312
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
It's none of your business.

313
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I talk to her every day and night.

314
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
She's talking about my own habits.

315
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm not talking about her.

316
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
I'm talking to you.

317
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
What are you doing?

318
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm warning you.

319
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
You've done this many times in the actual battle.

320
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I don't want to talk about you.

321
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm just talking.

322
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
You don't have the right to talk about me.

323
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm just looking at what you did before.

324
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
You...

325
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Let go.

326
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I won't let go.

327
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
What are you doing?

328
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
This is in the company.

329
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Don't talk nonsense.

330
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
I know.

331
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
What's wrong?

332
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Let's battle.

333
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Yes.

334
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Get up.

335
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Get up.

336
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Take away your clothes.

337
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I want to take it.

338
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Are you hungry?

339
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Let's go warm yourself up.

340
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,800
You...

341
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,160
You dare to go in again?

342
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,240
I'll hurt you!

343
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Don't come over!

344
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,960
Get lost!

345
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,680
Don't run.

346
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,120
I know it

347
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,680
You feel the same way

348
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Don't think that I don't know

349
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Do I have nothing without you

350
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Why hasn't she replied to my message yet?

351
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Fine, I won't touch you anymore

352
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Let's break up

353
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
You don't want to get involved with me, do you?

354
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
No

355
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Then what is it?

356
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Actually I lied to you

357
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
What did you lie to me about?

358
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,680
Actually, I'm not like what you see

359
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Then what is it?

360
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Actually, every moment I spend with you is not my own

361
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,680
I don't like to read those economic and political articles

362
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
I don't want to dress so decently

363
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Every action is so profound

364
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Every sentence is so well-organized

365
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
This...

366
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
This...

367
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
You think you are like this in my eyes?

368
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,680
You are a little moth in my eyes

369
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,680
I like to see you wear a flower dress and run around

370
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
You play the sugar man who is so silly

371
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
You take the sparrow who is so silly

372
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
You watch the comic with your feet

373
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
You are my little moth

374
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,680
You are the little moth you are so obsessed with

375
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Do you have anything else to say?

376
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
No

377
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
I'll take you back to the police station

378
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Okay

379
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Okay, I'm going to take a shower

380
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Go

381
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
What?

382
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
It's so late

383
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Why hasn't he come back?

384
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Why hasn't he come back?

385
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
This...

386
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
You...

387
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Stay away from me

388
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Dawei

389
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Let me go

390
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
I'm going

391
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
You touch me

392
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Dawei

393
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Let me go

394
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
What's wrong?

395
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Master

396
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
What's the matter?

397
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Excuse me

398
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
The weather is so nice today

399
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Give me some flowers

400
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,680
It's time to clear the grass

401
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,680
The water is so romantic

402
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Master, don't look down on me

403
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
You can't pick a place for me

404
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
You can't pick a place for me

405
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,680
No wonder you didn't finish your speech yesterday

406
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
You didn't answer my call

407
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
You went to work

408
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Master, I'm so embarrassed to see you

409
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
It's okay

410
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
It's not that serious

411
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
You finally figured it out

412
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,680
You're willing to be with Chi Cheng wholeheartedly

413
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
It's a good thing

414
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I'm happy for you

415
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Actually, we haven't reached the last step

416
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
No

417
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Why?

418
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,680
You can't accept it, can you?

419
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
I tried it

420
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
But it's really...

421
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,680
How about I buy you a bottle of perfume?

422
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Perfume?

423
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Keep your voice down

424
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
This voice is even louder than the one in the next room

425
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
How is it?

426
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Master

427
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
I've been a man for more than 20 years

428
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
You have to give me some time to prepare

429
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,680
If you want to stall

430
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Why don't you take advantage of the situation now

431
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,680
and make it clear that you were close to Chi Cheng

432
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
I want to do that too

433
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,680
But I don't want to be in this situation

434
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,680
I'll be a coward when I see Chi Cheng

435
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Master

436
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
How about you lend me two bullets

437
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
and kill me?

438
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
It's not that I don't want to help you

439
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,680
I don't have the courage to face Chi Cheng

440
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,680
It's over

441
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
But Master

442
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Is the perfume you just said really useful?

443
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
I'll buy you a bottle

444
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
Mom

445
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Mom, I'm back

446
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Where did you get the car?

447
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
The company has been doing well recently

448
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,680
I bought a second-hand car

449
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,680
I can come back to see you often after buying a car

450
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
and take you out for a ride

451
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
Mom, I bought you something in the car

452
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
I'll take it for you later

453
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,680
This kid is so arrogant when he makes money

454
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
You have to save some money

455
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Mom, you should save money

456
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Mom, the skin is ripe

457
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Yes, look

458
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Take some home when the time comes

459
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Okay, mom

460
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Mom, I'll take all these away

461
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
You have to take all of them away

462
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Oh, no

463
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Who are you going to leave it to?

464
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
You are a high school student

465
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
You can't eat these high-calorie fruits

466
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Yes, I have to take some to Chi Cheng

467
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
You want to give it to Chi Cheng?

468
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
You should have said it earlier

469
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,680
I left a box for him on purpose

470
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Mom, why are you so partial?

471
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,680
I took two bags and you just kept them

472
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
But you left a box for Chi Cheng

473
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Why is he so insolent?

474
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Chi Cheng always comes to our house

475
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
with a big bag and a small one

476
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,680
We only give him corn and loquat

477
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
What's wrong with giving him more?

478
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Why is Chi Cheng so nice to us?

479
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Mom, he is nice to everyone

480
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Mom

481
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,680
When did you come?

482
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Guess

483
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
I didn't mean to

484
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
I didn't mean to break in

485
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
I just heard the sound of the bathroom

486
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
So I...

487
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,680
You usually help Wu Suowei to trick me, right?

488
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,680
I didn't...

489
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
I didn't...

490
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
I didn't trick you

491
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Only me and Wu Suowei

492
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
How can I trick you?

493
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
I can record your chat

494
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
I have seen your chat records

495
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
You have known about Guo Chengyu and me

496
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,680
for so long, right?

497
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
I will do anything

498
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,680
as long as he likes me

499
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
I will give you five days

500
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,680
to solve his problem

501
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,680
and let him be with me willingly

502
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
If it's not done

503
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,680
I will go back to the state I was in

504
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,680
I can't bear to use him

505
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,680
but I can't bear to use you

506
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,680
But I don't have to do that to you

507
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Dr. Jiang, don't be so nervous

508
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
I believe you

509
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
I can't bear to use you

510
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
but I can't hide from you

511
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,680
You can't drink after taking this medicine

512
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
I know

513
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Dr. Jiang always tells me this

514
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Thank you, Dr. Pang

515
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Don't forget

516
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Pang, where is Dr. Jiang?

517
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
He has something to do at home

518
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Something?

519
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
What does he have to do?

520
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
I will go to him

521
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Thanks

522
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
Be careful

523
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
I will go to him

524
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
I will go to him

525
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,680
I will go to him

526
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
I will go to him

527
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Why are you drunk like this?

528
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,280
If you have something to say, just tell me. What are you trying to do?

529
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,080
What's the use of telling you?

530
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,360
Xiaoshui, I am no longer that weak and incompetent disciple.

531
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,540
I have the ability to help you get rid of everything.

532
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,080
Give me a chance to help you get rid of it.

533
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
You help me get rid of it?

534
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,400
You are the one who caused the trouble!

535
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,920
Is it true?

536
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,680
I'll go find him.

537
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,280
Don't cause me and Chi Cheng to have a conflict.

538
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:40,280
I already told you that this kind of person can't be

539
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Why?

540
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
This has nothing to do with you!

541
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,080
It didn't have anything to do with me, but you forgot.

542
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,680
Chi Cheng has been stealing from Guo Chengyu.

543
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,880
Now, Guo Chengyu is interested in me.

544
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,480
This is all because you are here.

545
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,880
Chi Cheng can't do anything to me.

546
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Now, you are not giving Chi Cheng any medicine.

547
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,080
I've already made him angry.

548
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,880
He's now secretly pointing the bag at me!

549
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,680
Forget it.

550
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,280
I'm not worth anything anyway.

551
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,480
I might as well be killed again!

552
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,080
Teacher, don't worry.

553
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,680
I will definitely get rid of everything.

554
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,680
Dawei, don't go!

555
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,480
Don't blame Teacher.

556
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Guo Chengyu, did you hear that?

557
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,880
Xiao Chuan is in danger now.

558
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,080
Chi Cheng can't sleep. He's going to attack Xiao Shuai.

559
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,680
I know.

560
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,080
You know but you still don't understand.

561
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,480
Then why didn't you agree to it?

562
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,080
It's because your own strategy didn't work.

563
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,680
You didn't even fully understand.

564
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,680
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

565
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,880
A lot of boys can't get through the night.

566
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,080
I don't think you need to worry too much.

567
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,280
Those people who are behind Chi Cheng's real gun,

568
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,880
they all have their own problems.

569
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,880
A lot of difficulties.

570
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,480
How long has Chi Cheng been sleeping?

571
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
I don't know.

572
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,280
I don't know.

573
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,480
I don't know.

574
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Are you happy that you're one of them?

575
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Or are you angry that you're just one of them?

576
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,680
Are you going to help or not?

577
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,880
What's wrong?

578
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,480
Of course I'm going to protect Xiao Shuai. Let Chi Cheng not fight him.

579
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,880
Okay.

580
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Then I'll change another boy to be the sniper.

581
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,680
I won't disturb Jiang Xiao Shuai.

582
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,880
Then he'll be safe.

583
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,080
It seems reasonable.

584
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
After you go back and tell him,

585
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,280
tell him that I don't like him anymore.

586
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Tell him to let go of 100 hearts.

587
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,880
Okay. I'll go now.

588
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,480
Are you really not going to disturb Jiang Xiao Shuai anymore?

589
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,480
It's exactly like that.

590
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,280
This time,

591
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,680
you're the one who's going to get in trouble.

592
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Master, there's a great news.

593
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,080
I've tested so many.

594
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,280
Don't be sad. I've solved the problem for you.

595
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,880
How did you solve it?

596
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Could it be that Chi Cheng is really asleep?

597
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,680
What are you thinking about? How is that possible?

598
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,280
What?

599
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,480
The problem hasn't been solved yet.

600
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,680
Let me tell you. The method I found is one-shot.

601
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,480
It can either solve your heart disease or my heart.

602
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,280
You won't listen, but you'll regret it.

603
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
I won't listen.

604
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,280
Let me tell you.

605
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,880
I went to see Guo Chen Yu today.

606
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,280
He promised me that he won't disturb you anymore.

607
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,680
He's going to chase someone else.

608
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
You're so kind.

609
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,280
He's going to chase someone else?

610
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
What's wrong?

611
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,080
Nothing. It's fine.

612
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,080
It's fine if he doesn't disturb me.

613
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,680
Say it.

614
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,280
Not only the sunset and the sea of clouds,

615
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,680
if after today,

616
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:56,280
we won't come back to this place again,

617
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,080
and the week will change,

618
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:08,080
I still want to tell you

619
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,080
that there is no fear of the stars or the mountains.

620
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,080
When the sun rises and sets,

621
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
I'll wait for you in my eyes,

622
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:29,080
and there's no fear of time.

623
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,080
On the last night of the earth,

624
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:45,080
I just want to confess to you.

625
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I'll use my heart to go through the end of the world.

626
00:38:52,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Maybe there's no regret.

627
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,080
On the last night of the earth,

628
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,080
when life turns into dust,

629
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:22,080
and the sea of water kisses the sky,

630
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:32,080
I'll hold you tight and leave without hesitation.
