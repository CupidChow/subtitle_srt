1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Your name is Mr. Liu.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,960
Did you mention precisely that your mother?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,120
I onlyx gloves are not walking like this.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,520
I am telling you that you need to?

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,080
No, voir.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,400
Where?

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,200
Where?

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,720
Don't you dare say that product i choose right.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
What about them?

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,520
Are they waiting for an answer?

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
When the breeze blows through my face,

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,680
it blows through my hair.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,720
They're quietly telling me some words.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,120
The sound of spring is like the sound of flowers.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,640
Is it all you?

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Is it all you?

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,640
The autumn leaves are in the winter, the four seasons are changing.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Is it all you?

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Is it all you?

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Episode 10

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
What?

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
You lied to me?

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,640
Actually, I had a purpose when I approached you.

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
What purpose?

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
I just want you to know.

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Enough.

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,640
You only have a girlfriend you've been dating for 3 years.

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
You don't care about your father.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
And you kicked her out.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,640
And then you want to use my shoulder to carry her.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Do you know I have a girlfriend who I've been dating for 3 years?

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
I know.

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
I don't know.

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,960
But I don't want to know.

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Why?

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Because I can't stand

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,880
your hard-hearted love

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,200
in my unchangeable history.

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,760
Dering is Ren pointer's boyfriend?

40
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,460
Yes.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,200
everything can change to now.

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,960
What you can do?

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,720
Say it.

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
Yes.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,040
What is it?

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,080
No one is brave enough

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,280
and go to the workplace.

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,560
That's right.

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,080
If you can keep it a secret,

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
don't take the risk.

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,160
You will be in a stable relationship in the future.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,960
Maybe one day,

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,680
you will bring it out.

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,960
That's right.

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,880
Weiwei,

56
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,480
transfer me your phone bill.

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,360
You can't do it yourself.

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,960
You're not in charge of the money in our family.

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,760
Who is in charge of your family?

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
I charged you 30 yuan.

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
You're really stingy.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,840
It's not about whether I'm stingy or not.

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm stingy on purpose.

64
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,720
Whoever calls me when they go out

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,760
and says nothing,

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,560
I will hang up.

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,200
That's not good.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,920
It means I love you.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,640
If love wants to last,

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
it should have me.

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,600
You should cling to it.

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
But I need my own space.

73
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,960
Then,

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,840
two men in love

75
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,920
need to be so stingy?

76
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,840
Do they need to be so stingy?

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
They really do.

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,120
The pants you bought me

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
are too big.

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,400
Can you

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
put them on a bigger size?

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,160
It's already the biggest size.

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Can you push it down?

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,040
It's fine.

85
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,240
It's fine.

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
I can wear the pants

87
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,040
after I turn it around.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
You've been raising a snake for seven years

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
because of Wang Shuo.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,440
Can you wear the pants

91
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,480
for seven years?

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,200
If you give me only one pants,

93
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,680
I can wear it for the rest of my life.

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
You mean

95
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,560
this pants is not good enough.

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,240
Let me buy another one.

97
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
How much money do you have in your small vault?

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,360
Don't take my money.

99
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,720
Weiwei,

100
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
you're really a magnetist.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
What do you mean?

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,920
Not only do you have a good taste,

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,600
you also know how to take others' money.

104
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,320
Credible!

105
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,160
Though I love you more than you love me,

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,360
you don't care about me left or right.

107
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,080
No.

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,480
I'm your boss now.

109
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,880
Any relationship or interest can be taken just like that.

110
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,280
I don't understand.

111
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,600
This presents the reason never to leave.

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,440
Thank you.

113
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,960
Is the price of the other party still not appropriate?

114
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,520
No, no, no.

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Wait a minute.

116
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
I think it's okay.

117
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,680
I suggest we can reduce some design

118
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,160
about mechanical aspects.

119
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,800
In this way,

120
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,320
we can control the cost better.

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,640
As long as we can make

122
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,280
the effect they want.

123
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,720
Okay.

124
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,760
I'll go to the mirror.

125
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay.

126
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,800
Why are you following me?

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Is the company closed?

128
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,280
Bullshit.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,880
My company's development

130
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,160
is going well.

131
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,360
So you two are fighting?

132
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,160
It's the opposite.

133
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
We are in a hot relationship now.

134
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,560
Don't say we are fighting.

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,960
We don't even have a half-mouth.

136
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,680
Then why are you here

137
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,160
with a sad face?

138
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,440
It's because the relationship is too good.

139
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,560
I have to force you.

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,760
You know,

141
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,720
his blood-stained house

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,200
is not a good place to live.

143
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
I don't want to live here.

144
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,640
I don't want to live here.

145
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Are you sure about this?

146
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,920
So let me Imperial Lord

147
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
tell you something.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
First,

149
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,160
you guys attacking with your necks

150
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,580
is

151
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,160
a bad thing.

152
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
I highly recommend you

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,320
do it again.

154
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,640
So we are dating.

155
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,480
Thewrite or not

156
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,180
we opticly

157
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,720
will end up like this.

158
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,440
Then I can make life meaningful.

159
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
I want him to be full.

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
But he can't.

161
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,440
I can't help him with this.

162
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Here you are.

163
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Thank you.

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Okay.

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Chen Daning.

166
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
No problem.

167
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Go back and take care of your diet.

168
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Have a good rest.

169
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Okay.

170
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Okay, go back and take care of yourself.

171
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Okay, thank you.

172
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Take this.

173
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
I'm leaving.

174
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Mr. Li.

175
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Come and sit.

176
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Okay.

177
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Dr. Jiang.

178
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
How long will you be in the hospital?

179
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Two or three months.

180
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
I'll take care of myself.

181
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
Okay, no problem.

182
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
You go back and take care of yourself.

183
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
Okay?

184
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Dr. Jiang.

185
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Have you ever thought about expanding your shop?

186
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
I have.

187
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,440
But now I need this.

188
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Then I wish Dr. Jiang a high salary.

189
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Okay, when I go back, I'll buy a lottery ticket.

190
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
I'll give him 5 million.

191
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Is the doctor lying?

192
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
What are you talking about?

193
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
I'm telling you.

194
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
This Dr. Jiang is a good doctor who is far from civilization.

195
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Okay, I'm fine.

196
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Uncle.

197
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Mr. Guo.

198
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Mr. Li, get your mask there.

199
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Take care of yourself when you go back.

200
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Okay.

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I'll be right there.

202
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Thank you.

203
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Dr. Jiang.

204
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Do you think Guo Chengyu will like you?

205
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Next.

206
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
He's not here.

207
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
He's been away for a long time.

208
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Why would he like you?

209
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
It's him again.

210
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
The men in the past

211
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
never ate what I cooked.

212
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Who did?

213
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Their later boyfriends.

214
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
It's a long story.

215
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Eat.

216
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,440
You must find the freshest green paper and the ground.

217
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Don't get it wrong.

218
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Don't pull it out when you get hurt.

219
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Right.

220
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
I think it'll make him feel better.

221
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Yes, it's good.

222
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Just follow the plan.

223
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Do whatever you want.

224
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Okay.

225
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Who's better?

226
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Cool.

227
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
You're asking for a change.

228
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
You're going back to the first version.

229
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
What are you thinking?

230
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I'm thinking

231
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
the sunset is so beautiful.

232
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
But the people around me

233
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
don't shave their beards.

234
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
They love to watch it.

235
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Your godfather and I forgot to shave.

236
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
We shaved it this morning.

237
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Who are you calling your son?

238
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
You're not my godfather.

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
You're my godfather.

240
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Who are you calling your son?

241
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Little rough is your brother.

242
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Don't pull me.

243
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
You're always here.

244
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Showing affection.

245
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
It's none of your business.

246
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Master.

247
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Let me explain.

248
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Explain what?

249
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
You're pulling me.

250
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Okay, someone's here.

251
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
What are you doing?

252
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Let's go.

253
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Go.

254
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Go.

255
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Go.

256
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Xiao Shuai.

257
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Xiao Shuai.

258
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
What's wrong?

259
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,640
I'm here to see you.

260
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
I'm here to see you.

261
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,840
You didn't come to see me

262
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,240
when Chi Cheng didn't come.

263
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
You blame me

264
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,640
for not coming to see you for a long time?

265
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,840
Yes.

266
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm here to see you.

267
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm here to see you.

268
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
I'm here to see you.

269
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
You haven't come for a long time.

270
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
But you see them so close.

271
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,040
Are you uncomfortable?

272
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,240
They are close?

273
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,840
Comfortable?

274
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,240
No.

275
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
I don't feel comfortable

276
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
seeing them so close.

277
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,440
Pretend.

278
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,840
Pretend again.

279
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,040
You...

280
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Are you

281
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,040
angry with me that night?

282
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,040
I didn't

283
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,040
touch you that day.

284
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,840
I know.

285
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,640
Don't worry.

286
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
Before you officially accept me,

287
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I won't be rude.

288
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,840
It depends on

289
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,440
whether you have the ability.

290
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,640
You don't really think

291
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
I can't

292
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
or don't want to be with you.

293
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,240
You are full of thoughts about Chi Cheng.

294
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,240
Of course you don't want to.

295
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
You don't think I like Chi Cheng, do you?

296
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,040
Don't you?

297
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,440
But I advise you

298
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,840
to stop it as soon as possible.

299
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,040
Chi Cheng

300
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,440
likes Wei so much.

301
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
You two are a match.

302
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,840
It's not suitable.

303
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm going to work.

304
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,640
You go back first.

305
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
I go back first.

306
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,640
I...

307
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,040
What's wrong?

308
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,440
I'll go first.

309
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,240
praying

310
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,400
No.

311
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,260
I'll try to get back

312
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,920
because of theVery goodI me.

313
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,000
Isn't itpreyoaseat me?

314
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,680
No.

315
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,800
Xiao Spirit.

316
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,300
Stop drinking!

317
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,640
You... you look like Ge Chengyu.

318
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,640
How is it? Is he very handsome?

319
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
He's very handsome.

320
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Ge Ping.

321
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Zhou...

322
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Xiao Shuai, stop drinking.

323
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Don't you care about me!

324
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Don't you care about me!

325
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,640
It's not my fault.

326
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
It's not my fault.

327
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,640
It's not. It has nothing to do with you.

328
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,640
It's not your fault.

329
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
It's not my fault.

330
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
It's not.

331
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Don't think about me when you cry.

332
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
It's not.

333
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Don't peek at my password.

334
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,640
This is my home. I know how to get there.

335
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Come. Be careful.

336
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Be careful.

337
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Slowly.

338
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Wine.

339
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Okay, I'll go pour the wine. Wait for me.

340
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Wine.

341
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Wine is here.

342
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Slowly.

343
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Slowly.

344
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Here, cheers.

345
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Be careful.

346
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,640
What's wrong?

347
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Why are you doing this to me?

348
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
What did I do to you?

349
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Don't be so nice to me.

350
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Why?

351
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Because...

352
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Because...

353
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Because...

354
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
You...

355
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,640
You're my ancestor.

356
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,640
It's gone.

357
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,640
I still want to tell you

358
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,640
No fear of the stars or the mountains

359
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
When the sun rises and sets

360
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,640
I'll wait for you in my eyes

361
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,640
No fear of time

362
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,640
How much did I drink yesterday?

363
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Apologize.

364
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Let him apologize to me.

365
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Apologize.

366
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Apologize.

367
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Apologize.

368
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Apologize.

369
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Apologize.

370
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
My god.

371
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
You're awake.

372
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
Let's go.

373
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Go out and have some soup.

374
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
I've prepared breakfast for you.

375
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Here.

376
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Have some milk.

377
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,640
How is it? Does it still hurt?

378
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,640
It doesn't hurt if you don't move.

379
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
If it doesn't hurt, don't drink it.

380
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,640
I want to drink it.

381
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
I want to drink it.

382
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
I want to drink it.

383
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
I want to drink it.

384
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
I want to drink it.

385
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Let me ask you.

386
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Did I say something stupid yesterday?

387
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
You didn't say anything stupid.

388
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,640
You kept saying I was tall, handsome and considerate.

389
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
I was very nice to you.

390
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,640
You're much more mature when you're sober.

391
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,640
I can't drink anymore.

392
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,640
You said you came out to go shopping.

393
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Yes, I checked.

394
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,640
When they're in love, they have to go out.

395
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
You can't stay at home.

396
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
You'll kill me.

397
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,640
That's a foreign luggage.

398
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Don't look at your phone.

399
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Let's talk.

400
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Give it to me.

401
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Sir, this is a magical couple watch.

402
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Look, one watch adjusts the time.

403
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,640
The other watch's compass will follow the movement.

404
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Even if they're separated by a thousand miles,

405
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
the two watches can be operated simultaneously.

406
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Isn't it amazing?

407
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,640
It's real. Look.

408
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
He doesn't like it.

409
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Thank you.

410
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Who likes you?

411
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
You.

412
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
How do you like it?

413
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Look at your hand.

414
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Wait for me.

415
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,640
I'll go to the bathroom.

416
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Okay, go.

417
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,640
The bathroom is not...

418
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Just say it.

419
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,640
What a vulgar excuse.

420
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
You're back.

421
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Let's go.

422
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
What's wrong?

423
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
You really went to the bathroom?

424
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Why not?

425
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Let's go.

426
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
I'll buy you a suit.

427
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Let's go.

428
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
You really bought it?

429
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
How did you get it?

430
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,640
You think you're the only one who knows how to do it?

431
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
It's time to buy me a suit.

432
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Buy it.

433
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Let's go.

434
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Let's go.

435
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,640
I must get it today.

436
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Didn't you say you'd buy me a suit?

437
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Why are you here?

438
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Let's do some exercise.

439
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Open your hands.

440
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
Inhale.

441
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
Exhale.

442
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
Let's go.

443
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
Okay.

444
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Let's see.

445
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
You go swimming for 20 days.

446
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Okay.

447
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Give me a hug.

448
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
What are you doing?

449
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
I didn't see you.

450
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
I know.

451
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,640
I just want to be with you.

452
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
I used to be very...

453
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,640
What did you say?

454
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,640
I...

455
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,640
I think you don't have a form now.

456
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,640
I've never had a form.

457
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
Let go.

458
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
It doesn't matter.

459
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Let go.

460
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Wu Suowei.

461
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Wu Suowei.

462
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Wu Suowei.

463
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Wu Suowei.

464
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Wu Suowei.

465
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
Wu Suowei.

466
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Wu Suowei.

467
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Wu Suowei.

468
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Wu Suowei.

469
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Wu Suowei.

470
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Wu Suowei.

471
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Wu Suowei.

472
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
Wu Suowei.

473
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Wu Suowei.

474
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Wu Suowei.

475
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Wu Suowei.

476
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Wu Suowei.

477
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Hello?

478
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
The stuff is here, right?

479
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Okay.

480
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Okay.

481
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
I'll go back now.

482
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Okay.

483
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Let's go.

484
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
You come to the company first.

485
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
I'll talk to you tonight.

486
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
Can you go home now?

487
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
I...

488
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
I suddenly remembered that I have something urgent to do at the company.

489
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,640
I have to go back and deal with it.

490
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
I'll drive you there.

491
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
No need.

492
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
I'm going now.

493
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
I'm going.

494
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Gangzi, don't sleep.

495
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Play with me for a while.

496
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
I can't play anymore.

497
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Wu Suowei hasn't come back yet?

498
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,640
What time is it now?

499
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
It's twelve o'clock.

500
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
It's too early.

501
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
He comes out early and comes back late every day.

502
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
He's all focused on his work.

503
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Is your company busy?

504
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Recently, there are indeed many company business.

505
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
But...

506
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
He doesn't have to sleep in the company every day.

507
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
He won't be behind you.

508
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
In the office...

509
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Is he going to be okay?

510
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Impossible.

511
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
He doesn't have the guts.

512
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
Then he won't dare.

513
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Look at how handsome he is.

514
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
His eyes are shining and bright.

515
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
What about others?

516
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
I think this way, he'll feel more comfortable.

517
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
It's good.

518
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
You just follow this plan.

519
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Let him feel comfortable.

520
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Okay.

521
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
Who feels more comfortable?

522
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Damn it.

523
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I'm going to change the ball.

524
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm going to change it back to the first version.

525
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Please come back next time.

526
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
I'm going to change it back to the first version.

527
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

528
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Can we go to the office today?

529
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Let's go.

530
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
You come to the office first.

531
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
I'll talk to you tonight.

532
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
I suddenly remembered that the company had an emergency.

533
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I have to go back and handle it.

534
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
I'll drive you there.

535
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
No need.

536
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
I can handle it myself.

537
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Let's go.

538
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Let's go.

539
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Come with me to the office.

540
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
Okay.

541
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Hurry.

542
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
I'll go with you.

543
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
I'll go with you.

544
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
I'll go with you.

545
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
You go that way.

546
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Okay.

547
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
I'll go with you.

548
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Why are you here?

549
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
I can't come, right?

550
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
No.

551
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
What is this?

552
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
This is the ecological shrimp I made for Little Chubo.

553
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
The one I made before was not enough material.

554
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
So I made it smaller.

555
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
He Jiong Po.

556
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Now the material is enough.

557
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
The space in the new house is quite big.

558
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
I want to change it for Little Chubo.

559
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Look at this old wood.

560
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
This leaf. This wood.

561
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Look at it.

562
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
It's like a forest.

563
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
I've checked the species of Little Chubo.

564
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
He will definitely like it.

565
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
Are you stupid?

566
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Are you stupid?

567
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Does it hurt?

568
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
No.

569
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Just put it on for a few days.

570
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
I said why you are so sneaky these days.

571
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
I'm sorry.

572
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
I'm sorry.

573
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
Shicheng.

574
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
I'm not used to love yet.

575
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
But my brain is fast enough.

576
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
I believe it won't take long.

577
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
I can definitely become a real boyfriend.

578
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
You.

579
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
You are already.

580
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
So when you rise up,

581
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
there'll be a world

582
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
that's better than life.

583
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
Ji Fu.

584
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Look at this.

585
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
He is really...

586
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,640
It's okay.

587
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
I don't care.

588
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
I'm sorry.

593
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640

595
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
I'm sorry.

596
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm sorry.

597
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
I'm sorry.

598
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
I'm sorry.

599
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
I'm sorry.

600
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
I'm sorry.

601
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
I'm sorry.

602
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,640
I'm sorry.

603
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm sorry.

604
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
I'm sorry.

605
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
I'm sorry.

606
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
I'm sorry.

607
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
I'm sorry.

608
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
I'm sorry.

609
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
I'm sorry.

610
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
I'm sorry.

611
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
I'm sorry.

612
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
I'm sorry.

613
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
I'm sorry.

614
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm sorry.

615
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
I'm sorry.

616
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
I'm sorry.

617
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
I'm sorry.

618
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
I'm sorry.

619
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
I'm sorry.

620
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
I'm sorry.

621
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
I'm sorry.

622
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
I'm sorry.

623
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
I'm sorry.

624
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm sorry.

625
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640

I'm sorry.

631
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,640
The last night of autumn

632
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,640
When life turns into dust

633
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,640
The moment the sea water kisses the sky

634
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
I will

635
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Hold you tight and leave
