1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows through my face and blows through my hair

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They're pretending to say something to me

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The spring breeze blows, the flowers are in full bloom

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are they all you?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They're all you

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The autumn leaves are in full bloom, the four seasons are changing

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's the same as you

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's the same as you

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 16

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
One

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Mr. Jiang, how many boxes does A-Sid Pilin need?

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Three

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Three boxes

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The last time Chi Cheng gave me a call

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Only three days left

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What should I do?

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Dr. Jiang

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Long time no see, Dr. Jiang

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Didn't you plan to change your partner?

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why did you come?

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If I change my partner, shouldn't you be happy?

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm happy. Am I not happy?

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Am I not happy?

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Dr. Jiang, how can you treat others like this?

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Doctor, doctor

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's wrong?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She doesn't want to live anymore. Treat her

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Shi Pa

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Get the medicine

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Qiu Yu, come and help

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't go

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hurry

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You all go first

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll stay here and guard

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
OK, I'm leaving

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Bye

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Her root problem is not solved

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's no use to guard her

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't guard her

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's the difference with not saving her?

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You go back first

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's okay

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Go

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're awake

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are you doing this to me?

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Calm down first

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Come, let me see

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What are you doing?

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let go

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let go

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let go

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let go

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let go

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let go

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What's wrong?

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Xiao Shuai

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you okay?

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Xiao Shuai

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What do you want?

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Qiu Yu, don't do this

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let her die

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
For a man like this

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She deserves to live so much

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's because of people like you

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That makes those who are serious about love

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Lose their courage

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Xiao Shuai

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm here to save you

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Xiao Shuai

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm speaking for you

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How are you?

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Calm down

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I didn't mean it

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's okay

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I know you're careless

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Lie down and rest

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't think too much

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's okay

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Have a good rest

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Xiao Shuai

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Xiao Shuai

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll help you

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm a doctor

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can do it myself

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's not convenient for you to do it yourself

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let me do it

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's go

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Be careful

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Be careful

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It might hurt

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hold on a little

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's okay

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's okay

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's okay

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's okay

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's okay

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's okay

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's okay

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's okay

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's okay

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's okay

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's okay

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's okay

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's okay

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's okay

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's okay

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Take it easy

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Does it hurt?

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then I'll hold on

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Only momentary memory

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Then would it be true?

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Maybe

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why must you still ask

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
why is he lonely

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You didn't leave just now?

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Leave

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Come on.

127
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,360
Forget it.

128
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,080
I'll do it myself.

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
Okay.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
So,

132
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,080
you don't like this idea.

133
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,240
It's okay.

134
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,880
I'll think of another one for you.

135
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,040
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,440
Bear with it.

137
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,560
For what I've done.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
Dr. Jiang, I'm back.

140
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,880
Thank you for taking care of me.

141
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,160
Zhuang,

142
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
you must love yourself more.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
Call me if you need anything.

144
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,480
What are you doing?

145
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
I have something to talk to you.

146
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,080
I've thought of a perfect

147
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,280
new way.

148
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,280
Do you want to hear it?

149
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,800
What is it?

150
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,120
Hello?

151
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,160
Dawei,

152
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,800
I have a good news.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
I promise you'll be happy.

154
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,880
What is it?

155
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,960
The snake king in Chi City

156
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,840
will be back in three days.

157
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,000
He'll be back at zero.

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,840
We'll be free then.

159
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,840
Snake king?

160
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,320
What snake king?

161
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
You mean the snake king?

162
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,160
Chi City has been missing him for six years.

163
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,480
For him,

164
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,000
he's willing to fight against Guo Chengyu.

165
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,280
So what if he's back?

166
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,560
You know what?

167
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Yuan Pei is back.

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,400
He has no time to deal with us.

169
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,640
In this case,

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,600
Chi City will lose interest in you.

171
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,400
You'll be in trouble.

172
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,040
Guo Chengyu was friends with him before.

173
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,080
Maybe he's been seduced.

174
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,680
I'll be free.

175
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
It's a one-shot-three-hit.

176
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,680
It's okay to go to the police.

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,800
That's good.

178
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,680
Dawei,

179
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,000
do you think we'll be in a big trouble?

180
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Yes.

181
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,200
I have a patient.

182
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,120
I'll go back first.

183
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,480
Deal.

184
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,840
You know what?

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,360
I'll eat the grass with my friend.

186
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
It's okay, sister.

187
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,560
I'll find you a better one every day.

188
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,520
No, I want to choose him.

189
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,360
I'll go.

190
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
Let's go to work.

191
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,160
Let's go.

192
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,960
I really want to tell you

193
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,080
that I don't know what will happen tomorrow.

194
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,800
If today is over,

195
00:11:51,880 --> 00:12:01,840
I won't come back to change the week.

196
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,280
I still want to tell you...

197
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,040
Mr. Wu.

198
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,360
Mr. Wu.

199
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
What's wrong with you?

200
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
I've checked the contract with the legal department.

201
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,360
Do you have any other questions?

202
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,080
Yes.

203
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,560
I was thinking about something else.

204
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,960
This contract

205
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,880
has been signed by Chi Cheng.

206
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,840
Why did you suddenly come to me this time?

207
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,920
I don't know where Mr. Chi went these days.

208
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,800
I can't reach him.

209
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,960
I just want to tell you

210
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,640
Come on.

211
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,440
This is the pipa on our tree.

212
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,160
Take it and share it with your colleagues.

213
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,920
Okay.

214
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I want to tell you that I don't know what will happen tomorrow.

215
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:02,040
Maybe there is no regret.

216
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,560
Go to our office.

217
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Chi Cheng,

218
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,360
I sent your grandma De Ning to kill the last persons who are sonoiny and ins ficar le video.

219
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I was so stupid to wait there.

220
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
What did you say when you told me?

221
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
You said it so harshly. You said I must kill you when you come back.

222
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Now that he's back,

223
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
he's going to lick it up.

224
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Stupid.

225
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Episode 2

226
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
I'm here to see Er Bao.

227
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Yes, that's what I said.

228
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Where's Mr. Shen?

229
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
He's retired.

230
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
When did he retire?

231
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Just these two days.

232
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Why did he retire?

233
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
What's the point of saying that?

234
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
He's a rich man.

235
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
He's just going to live here for a while.

236
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
He's going to experience life.

237
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Who can stand it after a long time?

238
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Experience life?

239
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
He's been experiencing it for six years.

240
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
He could stand it at first, but he can't stand it now.

241
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
What a poor Er Bao.

242
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
He's been drinking your heartless drink.

243
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
I should have dragged him here.

244
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
What? What did you say?

245
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Nothing.

246
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
It's already the last day.

247
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
You're here.

248
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
It seems like there's a play today.

249
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I can use the skill of the chicken.

250
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
How is it, Mr. Shen?

251
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
It's pretty good.

252
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
The good days are coming.

253
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Go out and have a drink.

254
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
I have to celebrate it.

255
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
What's wrong?

256
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I haven't disturbed you

257
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
in the past few days.

258
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
No.

259
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
I was worried that

260
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
I would change my mind.

261
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
After talking to Guo Cheng Yu,

262
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
I realized that

263
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
our worries are too much.

264
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
What did you two talk about?

265
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
What else can we talk about?

266
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Let's talk about the three of them.

267
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
I found that

268
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
I'm getting more and more interested in Wang Shu.

269
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
I used to think he was handsome

270
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
and had a high rank.

271
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Now I realize

272
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
he's a big fan of everyone.

273
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
And he's very talented.

274
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
He's very good at Chinese and Western music.

275
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
He can sing in high school.

276
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
He even wrote songs for Zhicheng.

277
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
And he's in good health.

278
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
He's a national athlete.

279
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Is it that exaggerated?

280
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Yes.

281
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Guo Cheng Yu slept with him once

282
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
and he was in the army for six years.

283
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Not to mention the time.

284
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
He slept with him for three years.

285
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
He has to be in the army for a lifetime.

286
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Such a deep poison flow.

287
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Who can get rid of it?

288
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Can you?

289
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
You can't.

290
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
You're so small.

291
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
You can't even see it.

292
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
You can't even read it.

293
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
You can't even write it.

294
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Yes, yes, yes.

295
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
And he's very bold.

296
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
He dares to do it behind Zhicheng's back.

297
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Do you dare?

298
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
You definitely don't dare.

299
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
You don't even dare to

300
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,360
say you betrayed him.

301
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
I don't like him.

302
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
Yes, yes, yes.

303
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
You don't like him.

304
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
I'm just kidding.

305
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Why are you so anxious?

306
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Anxious?

307
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Who's anxious?

308
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
How can you tell?

309
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Look, you're angry.

310
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Wei,

311
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
you don't look well.

312
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
What's wrong?

313
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm too anxious.

314
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm too anxious.

315
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Deng Bao,

316
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
anyone can be angry with me.

317
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Because only when you're angry,

318
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
I'll be anxious.

319
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
Even if you don't do it every day,

320
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I still like you.

321
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
I promise

322
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
I won't let you get hurt again.

323
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
You're my little mule.

324
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
You're the little mule

325
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
you're confused about.

326
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Liar! You're a big liar!

327
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Why did you do that?

328
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Because you're like a real man.

329
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
You have to be careful with your words.

330
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
You're my little mule.

331
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
I promise I'll never let you get hurt again.

332
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
I don't want you to get hurt.

333
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
You're my little mule.

334
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
You're my little mule.

335
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
You're my little mule.

336
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
You're my little mule.

337
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
It's just a breeze.

338
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Tomorrow will be another beautiful day.

339
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
What time is it?

340
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,960
Why is it still not zero?

341
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
He's a true fan of everyone.

342
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
And he's very talented.

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Zhong Xiyue is very good at it.

344
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
Guo Chengyu slept with him once.

345
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
He's been back for six years.

346
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
Not to mention Chi Cheng.

347
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,800
I even dreamed of being with him for a lifetime.

348
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
Yuan Pei is back.

349
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
Chi Cheng is no longer interested in you.

350
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't care if you can write songs.

351
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I don't care if you're brave or not.

352
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
I don't care if you're in good shape.

353
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
This is mine.

354
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,800
You're the one who's not afraid of me.

355
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,400
Get out of here.

356
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
I thought you'd show up at 11.59.

357
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
It seems that I've told you the time.

358
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I'm sorry.

365
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm sorry.

381
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:42,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
It's yours.

387
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,240
Then you can't get on the boat with him anymore.

388
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Not with him.

389
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Only with you.

390
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Then from now on,

391
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
when you're with me,

392
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,360
don't think of him.

393
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Don't worry.

394
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Why would I think of him?

395
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm warning you.

396
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,360
He's doing it for himself.

397
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,840
No matter how talented he is,

398
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,160
you'll only hear my singing.

399
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,520
No matter how good he is, he's his.

400
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,480
You should be concerned about his health.

401
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,360
You should be concerned about my neck and chest.

402
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,320
It's his business if he's bold.

403
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,400
Don't take his rhythm as a standard.

404
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I'm my own self-respect.

405
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,520
He's mine.

406
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,120
Jiang Xiaoshuai is really capable.

407
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Enough.

408
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,400
I told you I'm yours.

409
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Are you mine?

410
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Nonsense.

411
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Fine.

412
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,040
Since you're mine,

413
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,040
we should have a deal.

414
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,040
It's not good to be so poor in this society.

415
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Think about it.

416
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,240
If you don't have a pool,

417
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
who will you talk to

418
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,560
when I run away?

419
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,520
If you run away,

420
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,680
I'll go to someone else.

421
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,680
Who dares to rob me?

422
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,560
I'm notmudging what I'm doing.

423
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Shun.

424
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Come back.

425
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,320
If I run away from you,

426
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
you'll come after me.

427
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,600
Everyone però

428
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
엄마.

429
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,760
Stop!

430
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,400
I'll come after you!

431
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
moves.

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,440
Keep on as you are.

433
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm busy.

434
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,880
You're not free to go home now.

435
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,000
I'll be free tomorrow

436
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,920
to take off your clothes and go to the company.

437
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,880
Come on.

438
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,440
Let me think.

439
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,280
Keep doing this.

440
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I have to go home.

441
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,080
My dad called me.

442
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
It's really your dad.

443
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
It's really your dad.

444
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,440
Your dad called you so late.

445
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,800
There must be something urgent.

446
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,440
Go ahead.

447
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
I've been waiting for this day.

448
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,480
Wait for me to come back.

449
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,260
Art

450
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
I told her to stop.

451
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,680
Do you think she will want

452
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,920
to come back?

453
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,600
It has happened to her.

454
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,120
Now what?

455
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,200
I'm worried

456
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm not a fool.

457
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Don't be shy.

458
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm going.

459
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Xiao Tian, be honest with me.

460
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,920
I'm here to talk about something.

461
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
How often do you come here?

462
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,920
I don't come here often.

463
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Let's go.

464
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Oh, right.

465
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Young Master Chi hasn't come here for a long time.

466
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
What is he busy with?

467
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I miss him so much.

468
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,920
We're here. Let's go.

469
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Everyone, please keep me company today.

470
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
How many?

471
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Good.

472
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
I'll answer the phone.

473
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Have fun.

474
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
You're Chi, right?

475
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Yes.

476
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Is Chi often here?

477
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
He comes here every day.

478
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
He stays here all night.

479
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
He's so naughty.

480
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
What does he come here for?

481
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
What do you think?

482
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Is he really here to sing and dance?

483
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Chi likes to play with the public.

484
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Did you notice the second room at the door when you came?

485
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
As soon as Chi enters,

486
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
there are many ghosts and wolves in the house.

487
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
He's so naughty.

488
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Does he often call you?

489
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
I'm the one he calls the most.

490
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
He said I'm obedient.

491
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,400
He can torture me as he wants.

492
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Look.

493
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Look at the cigarette butts here.

494
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Chi made them for me.

495
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Why are you leaving?

496
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
I have something to do in the company.

497
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
What is it?

498
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Come on.

499
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Let's have fun.

500
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Let's have fun.

501
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
He hasn't shown up for a day.

502
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
And he hasn't done it.

503
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
I think he's done his job.

504
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
God bless him.

505
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
God bless him to succeed.

506
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
God bless him.

507
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
God bless him.

508
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
God bless him.

509
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
I'm so angry.

510
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
What's wrong?

511
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
What happened?

512
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I just broke into Chi Cheng's camp.

513
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I stole his bottom out of Namu's mouth.

514
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I want to kill him now.

515
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
It's a little late for you to know today.

516
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,400
You slept with Chi Cheng yesterday.

517
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Almost.

518
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
If his father hadn't called him back,

519
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I would regret it if I did it.

520
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
I slept with him.

521
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
It's not bad if I didn't break up with him.

522
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,880
But he didn't choose to be with me.

523
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
I will break up with him...

524
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
right now.

525
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
No.

526
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
No.

527
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,640
What are you talking about?

528
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Uh...

529
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
the sad thing in living is not that sad.

530
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
It seems so.

531
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
I think they are still talking.

532
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
It's serious.

533
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Let's make a wasn-a.

534
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,840
Why?

535
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
I'm begging you

536
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
You can hide here forever

537
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
If you say so, I'll go

538
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Don't go

539
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,840
What about the clinic?

540
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
I can take a break for two days

541
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Take a break?

542
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm the best place to take a break

543
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Let's go

544
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
I'll be gentle

545
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
You have your own private doctor

546
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
How can you go to my clinic?

547
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
See what you want to eat

548
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
I'll cook it for you

549
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Where are you?

550
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
You haven't answered my call since last night

551
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
You can't hear me, can you?

552
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Don't touch me

553
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
What do you mean?

554
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
I think you're dirty

555
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
What?

556
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
I mean

557
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,840
I think you're dirty

558
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
What?

559
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
I mean

560
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
I think you're dirty

561
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,840
I think you're dirty

562
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
You think I'm dirty?

563
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Yes

564
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,840
No.1 club, No.6 male demon, Tian asked me to transfer the position

565
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
He misses you

566
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Do you have to investigate me there?

567
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
I don't know how many people I've played with

568
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
I was dirty like this in the past

569
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
You regret it now

570
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
If I want to regret, will I scold you?

571
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
What's wrong with me scolding you?

572
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I shouldn't scold you for the dirty things you did

573
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
I'm not happy

574
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
I just want to say it

575
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
I think you're dirty

576
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
I think you're dirty

577
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,840
You and Wu Suowei are still together?

578
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
What do you mean?

579
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
You're afraid we'll break up, right?

580
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,840
No. I think you have a bad mood

581
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
I think you have a bad mood

582
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
I will take you to the hospital

583
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm sorry

584
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
I'm sorry

585
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Xu Chen?

586
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,080
Can you talk?

587
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,240
Sit down.

588
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,640
Yes?

589
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
He doesn't let me touch it.

590
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,040
Why?

591
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,960
He thinks it's dirty.

592
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,840
How dare he gets rid of...

593
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,800
Why?

594
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
I'm sorry.

595
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
What's wrong?

596
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
Say it again.

597
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
I didn't say anything.

598
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
The pharmacy is in front.

599
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
What's wrong?

600
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Bring me some medicine.

601
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
What medicine?

602
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
The medicine that can reduce the fire.

603
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
No.

604
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
I have to think of a way.

605
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
10 by 80.

606
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
82.1.

607
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
That's it.

608
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Tian.

609
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Chi Cheng and I have arrived at Sheng Hao Club.

610
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
When will you come?

611
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
The club.

612
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
I'm sorry.

613
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
I made a mistake.

614
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
You made a mistake?

615
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
I made a mistake.

616
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
Where is he going?

617
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
I knew he couldn't hold it.

618
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
This is the public's public announcement.

619
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
I want to kill him.

620
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Chi Cheng.

621
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Didn't you say you have a client to see me?

622
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,840
I want to order a set of art decorations.

623
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Why did you bring me here?

624
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
The client will be here soon.

625
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Let's play first.

626
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Chi Cheng, you're finally here.

627
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Get lost.

628
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
Chi Cheng, he's dragging me.

629
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Chi Cheng.

630
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
I'll take care of him.

631
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Chi Cheng.

632
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Listen up.

633
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
From today onwards,

634
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,840
we will say goodbye here.

635
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
We can't show our gratitude to everyone.

636
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
If anyone wants to see him,

637
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
take a look.

638
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
There will be no more chance

639
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
after you leave this door.

640
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
What does this mean?

641
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
Go back and do your work.

642
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
I'm really worried about you

643
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
when you leave this door.

644
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Where is this?

645
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
My new home.

646
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
But...

647
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
It will soon become your new home.

648
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
I'm in a small village.

649
00:36:42,840 --> 00:37:07,840
Linaktime

650
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,560
I really want to tell you

651
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,320
Not only the sunset and the sea

652
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,320
If today will not come again

653
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,120
No fear, the week will change

654
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,280
I still want to tell you

655
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,360
Not only the stars or the mountains

656
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,240
The sun rises and sets in my eyes

657
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,600
Waiting for you without fear

658
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,560
Time stops

659
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,040
The last night of the earth

660
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,360
I just want to confess to you

661
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:27,200
Use a heart to go through the end of the day

662
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:35,040
Maybe there is no regret

663
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,040
The last night of the earth

664
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,880
When life turns into dust

665
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,880
The moment the sea is in the sky

666
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,160
I will hold you without hesitation

667
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,040
Let's go
