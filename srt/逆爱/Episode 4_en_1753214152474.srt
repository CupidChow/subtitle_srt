1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
No.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows past my face, it blows through my hair

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And tells me a few words

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The spring breeze blows, the flowers bloom

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's you, it's you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The autumn leaves fall, the winter leaves bloom

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's you, it's you

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't look at Chi Cheng as a playboy.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He is a top student who graduated from the University of Tsinghua.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You don't have his family background.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You should at least know some culture.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What are you doing?

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm reading.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why didn't you reply?

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What are you doing?

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Da Bao.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Da Bao.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you busy?

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you are busy, then say it.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want to go to you.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah.

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Zhu, help me get rid of this rogue.

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Does it hurt?

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No.

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go out and chat.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't have time.

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The car is at the door.

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Whatever.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I found that reading the book of the dragon

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
is like seeing a surprise turn.

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's always a joke, a joke, an exaggeration.

36
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The most exciting PG game on the line.

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The mahjong is over.

38
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The mahjong is over.

39
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The queen of the prize pool.

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Find the golden city.

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The super high rate of compensation.

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The reward frequency is high.

43
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hurry up and join.

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The Macau New Beijing Entertainment Center.

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The end of history.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Where are you going?

48
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Tea house.

49
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You said that history is so dramatic.

50
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why would someone like to read novels?

51
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you think religion can monopolize the truth?

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think that all the unkind behavior

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is due to the fear of humanity.

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Especially those who are highly respected.

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
They will not hesitate to confuse the public at all costs.

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Just like what you said, the situation of the blind.

57
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What do you think?

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't talk to me about these shit.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's talk about the steel door.

60
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Are you free tonight?

61
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What?

62
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You want to be hurt by me so quickly?

63
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Except tonight, the time and place are up to you.

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It seems that Yue Yue is going to see her parents tonight.

65
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What a coincidence.

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Except tonight,

67
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
there is no time for anything else.

68
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Then it's a coincidence.

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't let you run away.

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm the bilingual artist, Nancy.

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Of course I can understand.

73
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Thank you for taking the time to attend this summer concert.

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
First of all, let me invite the piano, John, to bring us his performance.

75
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's welcome.

76
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Guanxi.

77
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's have a good talk.

78
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you.

79
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Forget it.

80
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
For the sake of revenge, I can't help but sacrifice.

81
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He can't do this all the time.

82
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So I can keep him here.

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,000
Sorry that I hurt you.

86
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's a music concert that is famous for singing.

87
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're done?

88
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,640
Is it that good?

89
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
You have one too.

90
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,040
You'll know when you taste it.

91
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I want yours.

92
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
Aren't they all the same?

93
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,200
You...

94
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Endure it.

95
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,520
It's truly yours, Bi Jiu Tian.

96
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
Do not be angry.

97
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,960
It's a good thing.

98
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,160
Endure it.

99
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,560
This chance runs out part-time,

100
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,360
something else is going on.

101
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,840
Or maybe

102
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:37,400
Lu Di has sold shampoo

103
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,440
to a girl just like a friend.

104
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
A Yan.

105
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Darn it.

106
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,640
What am I talking about?

107
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,840
Show some respect.

108
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,360
What do you mean?

109
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,920
You're just showing respect to others' pants.

110
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,600
I just want to see if you've worn the pants I bought for you.

111
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
You've bought so many pants and so many pieces.

112
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,280
How do you know if I'm wearing them or not?

113
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,360
You're talking nonsense.

114
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,000
I bought all your pants myself.

115
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,920
I chose the brands, style and fabric.

116
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,960
You're waiting for me to sell them to the market?

117
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,480
Blow it for me again.

118
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,520
What?

119
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,000
Tang Ren.

120
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Why do you blow it again?

121
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,560
My girlfriend likes it.

122
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,280
She likes it more and more?

123
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,960
She used to think that these are all bad things.

124
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,520
It's true.

125
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,080
A young man like you

126
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
is doing all these for a woman.

127
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,520
You want this and that.

128
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
You've been baking for so long.

129
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,120
You're doing all this to make a friend.

130
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,680
What's wrong?

131
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,960
You're not happy to see my girlfriend off?

132
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,880
Be good.

133
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,880
Blow it for her.

134
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,600
I'll do it.

135
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,480
Wait, Why don't I do this for her.

136
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,720
You're doing this with my finger Consort ahead.

137
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,120
I knew that Bidu's response on your shoulders

138
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,440
was so experienced.

139
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,920
So,

140
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,280
I should blow it for her.

141
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,240
Why is everything so nice?

142
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,440
What do you think?

143
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,920
I don't know.

144
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,640
That sense of near orSTEAND still considered as meaningless.

145
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,540
How long

146
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,260
Before the powered-up moisturization

147
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,920
Please give Deposit

148
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,000
Worship for a while

149
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't be a kid.

150
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,040
Who's a kid?

151
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,440
Don't touch the water.

152
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,280
What's wrong?

153
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,400
Take it to your girlfriend.

154
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
I won't eat it this time.

155
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,640
You're too annoying.

156
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,920
This cup is needed.

157
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,440
Give it to him.

158
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,440
If you don't give it to him,

159
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,400
he will definitely

160
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,160
play you fair in court.

161
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,280
I requests you

162
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,800
to keep it for me one more time.

163
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
If you can't,

164
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,800
let the bad guys

165
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,800
get the job done.

166
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm nice to you,

167
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,360
to start the woman's dream forever.

168
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,960
What're you staring at?

169
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,200
Hey.

170
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,480
What's the difference between him and Wang Zheng Long?

171
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,920
He is just a young boy

172
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,040
who has no girlfriend.

173
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,120
Moreover,

174
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,680
he is even more beautiful than Wang Zheng Long.

175
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,760
He is just watching the pot in his bowl.

176
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,400
Go to sleep.

177
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,800
He left.

178
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,760
He left early.

179
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,360
What time?

180
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
Around...

181
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
I decided it at night.

182
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,200
He didn't sleep here last night?

183
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,480
Why should I let him sleep here?

184
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,080
Did you two do nothing?

185
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,840
We played a trick on him.

186
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,440
Again?

187
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
Can you do something else?

188
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,960
You think I want to play tricks on him?

189
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,560
He's the one who keeps asking for it.

190
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,960
If I didn't ask for it,

191
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,040
would I be satisfied?

192
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,560
Don't just sell clothes.

193
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,960
Your sister is a deep woman.

194
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,800
What did you say?

195
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,600
I mean,

196
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,560
that's not how men are.

197
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,600
After all, men are flesh and blood.

198
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,280
It's too monotonous to just go there.

199
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,520
If it goes on like this,

200
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,880
the city will be changed for a few days.

201
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,960
Yueyue also ran away with another man.

202
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
Who are you going to revenge?

203
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,360
I think

204
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
you should give her more

205
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,960
and she'll definitely respond.

206
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,840
Take her down while it's hot.

207
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,920
Did you two really

208
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,840
have no physical contact yesterday?

209
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes.

210
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,240
Does she steal the smallest weapon?

211
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes.

212
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,240
Why not?

213
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,320
How do you respond?

214
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,280
I'll answer her.

215
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,240
You're going to respond to this?

216
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
It's from her mouth.

217
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,680
What a great opportunity.

218
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Brother,

219
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,120
you don't mind being dirty,

220
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,560
but I do.

221
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,880
Brother,

222
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
I'm coming.

223
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,920
It's me.

224
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,680
It's your turn.

225
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
I'm back.

226
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,080
I'm back.

227
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm back.

228
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,720
I'm back.

229
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,480
Hello?

230
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,920
Hello?

231
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,760
I want to go up to you.

232
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,600
You should give her

233
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,160
more and she'll definitely respond.

234
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,840
Me too.

235
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,160
What did you say?

236
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,040
I...

237
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,320
I said

238
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,200
I want to go up to you.

239
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,440
OK.

240
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,160
What's wrong with you?

241
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,520
Do you want to

242
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,080
join me to have a drink?

243
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,320
My side!

244
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,080
Wow.

245
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,520
How could you do this to me?

246
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,320
You really are telling him the truth?

247
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,920
Stop laughing. It's all your fault for making this bad idea.

248
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Now, it's so embarrassing.

249
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,720
People just hang up and disappear.

250
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,620
Is that what you're saying?

251
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,320
Then what should I say? I'll say it.

252
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,920
Come on.

253
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm not a woman.

254
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm not a

255
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,520
Why are you here?

256
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Look.

257
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
I...

258
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,720
Damn.

259
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,120
Why is Chi Cheng here?

260
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,920
How would I know?

261
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
This is the clinic.

262
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,320
I'm here to change the medicine.

263
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,720
It's normal, right?

264
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,920
Why are you here?

265
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,520
Your house and the company are quite far from here, right?

266
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
There's no hospital nearby.

267
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,920
What should I do now?

268
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
How would I know?

269
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,120
What?

270
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,720
You're too fast.

271
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,320
I haven't done it yet.

272
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
You just killed me.

273
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Are you crazy?

274
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
No.

275
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,520
You like him?

276
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,520
I like him.

277
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,320
I'm going out to chat.

278
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Let's go.

279
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,920
How did they know him?

280
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Then we can find a breakthrough from Guo Cheng Yu.

281
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,320
Maybe we'll get an accident.

282
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,320
So?

283
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,320
How did you get this wound?

284
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,720
In your shoulders.

285
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,520
Why would you go to our company?

286
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
The taste is good.

287
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
The chef is good.

288
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
I went to taste it.

289
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
I was thinking if I could dig a few chefs away.

290
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
So?

291
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Did you dig it away?

292
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
The chefs there are

293
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
as good as the thieves.

294
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
The chefs didn't dig it away.

295
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
I'm in trouble.

296
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Why?

297
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Hello?

298
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Hello, boss.

299
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
There's something wrong with the car.

300
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Okay.

301
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
I'll be right there.

302
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,520
The snake is more important than the person.

303
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Yes.

304
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,520
You can't go back.

305
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
I'm going to the hospital.

306
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
I'll be there.

307
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Okay.

308
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Don't forget.

309
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,520
You can investigate Wu Suowei

310
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,520
and all my detailed information.

311
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
Send me a message.

312
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Okay.

313
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
This...

314
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
What's wrong?

315
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Nothing.

316
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm fine.

317
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Well...

318
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
Ask him.

319
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Well...

320
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I'm almost done.

321
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Done.

322
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Wait.

323
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
What's wrong?

324
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Come on.

325
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
I...

326
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
I...

327
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Yes.

328
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
That's it.

329
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
I'll get you some medicine.

330
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Okay.

331
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Take this and eat it.

332
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
It'll be better.

333
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
How much?

334
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
32.

335
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Just give me 30.

336
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Well,

337
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
I've got the credit card.

338
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
How about we add a contact?

339
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

340
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
You're a cheat.

341
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
You're an excuse.

342
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Forget it.

343
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
I have to help Wu Suowei find out the news.

344
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I'll add it first.

345
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Okay.

346
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I'll go first.

347
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

348
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
You...

349
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
It's okay.

350
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
I'll find a way to contact you.

351
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,480
It's evil.

352
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,820
It's an

353
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
It's not as annoying as our entire group.

354
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
We've not buried it in a single piece.

355
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
It's our coaster.

356
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
It's so thin that no one can see it.

357
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
It seems that someone really wants to sell your snake.

358
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,080
After all, your snake is expensive.

359
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,320
So this snake

360
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,400
is hiding in the company.

361
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
Car?

362
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,280
The canteen?

363
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,520
The chef there

364
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,320
is just like a thief to me.

365
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
So he found it early.

366
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,760
Let's just get it back.

367
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,240
No.

368
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,240
Don't do it wrong.

369
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,880
The car is already locked.

370
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,360
Could it be that the chairman has already known the news

371
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,400
and transferred it to the ground?

372
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,040
Since they are selling it secretly,

373
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,920
they must be more afraid of that old man than me.

374
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,320
And it's not just one person.

375
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,880
Use it well.

376
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,480
That's right.

377
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,720
Such a big snake.

378
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,240
It's not easy to get it out of the company without any damage.

379
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
The chairman may have arranged a lot of people.

380
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,400
Even if we get it out, it's still a two-way trade.

381
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,040
It's hard to guarantee that the old man will get it again.

382
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,680
We have to find a way to get it back.

383
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,240
Now Guo Changyu has already known this news.

384
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,640
The old man and I have been in a two-way trade.

385
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,200
We've already made the old man and I get a discount.

386
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,480
Guo Changyu?

387
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,400
How did he know?

388
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,400
He has a few hundred eyes.

389
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,240
You know it too.

390
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,520
You want to find something?

391
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,720
Where's the gift?

392
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,480
Where is it?

393
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,680
You're living together, huh?

394
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,320
No.

395
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,920
I should be leaving.

396
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,760
I'm sorry.

397
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,040
Why are you taking things from him?

398
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,400
I just want to see

399
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,080
what kind of books

400
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,680
that guy who said he wanted to sleep with me reads.

401
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,720
Why do you still remember this?

402
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,920
I thought I would forget him as soon as I touched it.

403
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,040
Hey.

404
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,600
When did you start to have feelings for me?

405
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,000
I really don't have

406
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,720
that kind of feeling for you.

407
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,480
Since...

408
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,840
Since the day...

409
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,680
So, according to what you said,

410
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,360
you arranged all the meetings

411
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,840
on purpose.

412
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,880
It was you who arranged it.

413
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,680
And you pushed it on me.

414
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,560
Yes.

415
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,880
Then why didn't you just say you liked me?

416
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,080
Are you shy?

417
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,440
Don't you want to?

418
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,640
I...

419
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,000
Do I want to

420
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
or not?

421
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,440
Who are you asking?

422
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,240
I...

423
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,280
Why are you so afraid of me?

424
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,640
I won't eat you.

425
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,320
Don't be afraid.

426
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,160
I've never been here before.

427
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,400
We're all men. What do you want?

428
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,480
I don't want to

429
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,560
be like this with you.

430
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,680
What?

431
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,760
You've never kissed a man?

432
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,240
Nonsense.

433
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,120
Do I look like

434
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,160
I've kissed a man?

435
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,600
Then how do you know you like men?

436
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,600
I...

437
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,200
I...

438
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,840
I don't know

439
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
if I like men.

440
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,360
But...

441
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,000
But I know

442
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,600
I like you.

443
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,960
I don't know

444
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,000
what's going on

445
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,520
between Wu Suowei and Chi Cheng.

446
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,400
And that Guo Chengyu.

447
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,600
He and Chi Cheng

448
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,920
look like they're not on good terms.

449
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
How did he find

450
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
my clinic?

451
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,800
Why is he so calm?

452
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,120
Or

453
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,720
I should talk to him.

454
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,680
I saw you

455
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,360
talking to Chi Cheng that day.

456
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,160
You two know each other.

457
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,640
I'm sorry.

458
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,880
I'm sorry.

459
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,680
I'm sorry.

460
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,320
I'm sorry.

461
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,040
I'm sorry.

462
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,760
I'm sorry.

463
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,360
I'm sorry.

464
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,920
I'm sorry.

465
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,600
I'm sorry.

466
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,240
I'm sorry.

467
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,600
I'm sorry.

469
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,120
Who told you so?

470
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,920
And now heН's

471
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,400
troublesome as well.

472
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,880
No.

473
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,640
That was a wrong idea.

474
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,440
If

475
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,120
we get anything wrong,

476
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,560
and investigation his hurt again,

477
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:30,280
he'll have

478
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,800
Tell them not to know about my sauce.

479
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,200
Understand?

480
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,200
So long now.

481
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,440
What's wrong?

482
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,280
Stop facing it.

483
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,400
Not at all.

484
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
The fire place is private.

485
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,120
How do you know it's private?

486
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,000
Don't tell me that

487
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
Mom.

488
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,100
It looks like a well-made picture.

489
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,560
I didn't expect it to be that boring.

490
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You haven't got up yet?

491
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,440
I don't want to get up.

492
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,640
You don't want to get up?

493
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,240
Why don't you want to get up?

494
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,440
I want to die.

495
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,840
Did he do that to you?

496
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,440
Did you bleed?

497
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,200
You...

498
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,280
You bleed.

499
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,280
Bleed?

500
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,880
Yesterday,

501
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,080
he kissed me.

502
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,680
That's all?

503
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,280
I thought you were in trouble.

504
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,600
What a waste of feelings.

505
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,680
Master,

506
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,280
don't you want to comfort me?

507
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Master.

508
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
Master.

509
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,080
Okay, take your medicine.

510
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,240
Thank you, Dr. Shuai.

511
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,200
Did something really happen?

512
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,400
Dawei.

513
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,400
Dawei.

514
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,040
Dawei.

515
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,440
You haven't got up yet.

516
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,840
Why are you having a fever?

517
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,440
Why don't we just stop here?

518
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,760
You're so kind.

519
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,120
You should just bite your tongue.

520
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,400
When you go public,

521
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
sell it at a good price

522
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
and open a store.

523
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,040
Maybe

524
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,160
many girls will come after you.

525
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,960
What are you doing?

526
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,840
In my dictionary,

527
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,920
there's no half-way.

528
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,640
Why are you getting up?

529
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,600
I'll go to rest for a few days.

530
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,640
No.

531
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
You're having a fever.

532
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
I'm a new patient.

533
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,040
I can't get rid of the needle and needle.

534
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,840
I can only fight against the needle by force.

535
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
I'll get you some medicine.

536
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,320
No need.

537
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,640
By the way,

538
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't want to see Chi Cheng these days.

539
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,520
Shuai, come to me.

540
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,640
Help me apply it.

541
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,080
Okay.

542
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,920
Thank you.

543
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Dawei, your slippers.

544
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,680
I don't know if I like Xiu Hainan.

545
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,960
But I know

546
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,280
I like you.

547
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,760
Shuai,

548
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,120
challenging me?

549
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,240
Don't be afraid.

550
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,200
I'm here.

551
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,080
You must be a woman.

552
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,000
Yes, I am.

553
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,600
Are you summer?

554
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,680
Yeah.

555
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,320
Come on.

556
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,340
But you are worried about me

557
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,120
And I

558
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,340
You don't even care about me

559
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,860
As long as you are in love with me

560
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,280
It's your choice

561
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,540
You know

562
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,700
I just share it with you

563
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,820
We…

564
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,220
From now on

565
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,920
I think butter or paint

566
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,840
You must have mein

567
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,540
I won't play much

568
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,400
Once in theOwn Side

569
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,000
Ok

570
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,300
I won't give in

571
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,360
No

572
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
I'm going to find it.

573
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,360
One.

574
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
It doesn't matter.

575
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Keep it.

576
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
One.

577
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Two.

578
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,360
I really want to tell you

579
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
that

580
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,360
there is no such thing as a sunset or the sea of clouds.

581
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,360
If today is over,

582
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,360
I won't look for you again.

583
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
I'll wait for you.

584
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
I'll wait for you.

585
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,360
Come, don't be afraid.

586
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,360
The week is open.

587
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,360
I still want to tell you

588
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,360
that there is no such thing as a sunset or the sea of clouds.

589
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,360
The sun rises and sets.

590
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,360
I'll wait for you in my eyes.

591
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,360
Don't be afraid.

592
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,360
Time stops.

593
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,360
The last night on earth.

594
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,360
I just want to confess to you.

595
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:43,360
I'll spend the last moment with a heart.

596
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Maybe there is no regret.

597
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,360
The last night on earth.

598
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,360
When life turns into dust.

599
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:13,360
The moment when the sea is kissing the sky.

600
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:23,360
I will leave you with no hesitation.
