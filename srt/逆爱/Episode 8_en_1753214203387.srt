00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Episode 21

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows through my face and blows through my hair

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They're telling me something

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The spring breeze blows and the flowers bloom

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is it all you?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's all you

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The autumn leaves are in full bloom

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The four seasons change

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's the same with you

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's the same with you

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's the same with you

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I want to kill you

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I want to kill you

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's late at night. What are you doing?

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did he find out something?

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Guo Chen Yu wouldn't tell him, right?

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Even if Guo Chen Yu didn't tell him, Yue Yue would be with him every day

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Would he tell him something?

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why do you want to kill me?

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're a scoundrel

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I...

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why did I do that?

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You didn't tell me

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Please forgive me

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're so bad

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why did I forgive you so easily?

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I...

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Then... what do you want?

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Tell me

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I...

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Do you miss me?

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I want to chop you

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come on, chop me

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Silly

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Silly

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How about this?

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's good

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll wait for you outside

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wait a minute

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This one, this one, this one, this one

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll wrap them all up

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you have a bigger one?

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll go get it

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll go get it

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll go get it

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll go get it

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll go get it

50
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
One yuan for the toys

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Wrap them all up

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It only took five minutes

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's not even fifty minutes

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah

56
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why am I so close now?

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is not a good sign

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, I have to turn around

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Six days

60
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Six days

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have no news for six days

62
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Are you crazy?

63
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But it's true

64
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm treating you well

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm enjoying you

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I won't come back even if you're bad

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll go get it

68
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll go get it

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Shi Cheng

70
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Shi Cheng

71
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Shi Cheng

72
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Shi Cheng

73
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You

74
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You

75
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You

76
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Who are you?

77
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You

78
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You

79
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You

80
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You

82
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You

83
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You've been missing me since you started to miss me

84
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How do you know I'm missing you?

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you doing?

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You

87
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Who are you missing?

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I lost

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What are you doing?

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't do anything

91
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Get in

92
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Just sleep

93
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No

94
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Am I too deep?

95
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let me ask you

96
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What is this?

97
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Are you stupid or am I?

98
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Chopsticks

99
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No

100
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In my hands

101
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The second one is yours

102
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The second one is mine

103
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The next one can be an art device

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're doing this again

105
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Art device

106
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going to open an art device company

107
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You don't understand

108
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Art device is to use art, lights, sound

109
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
To do something with art style

110
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The small bag you made

111
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's also a kind of air-conditioner

112
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But it's more practical

113
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Can it be different?

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
With your brain

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Are you sure you can understand?

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why can't I?

117
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Have you been to my house?

118
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yes

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is it good?

120
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let me tell you

122
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Flower pot, table chair, light, and dinner

123
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I made them all myself

124
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Amazing, right?

125
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I told you

126
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I have an art cell since I was a kid

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And my previous company

128
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Has a lot of related business

129
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I checked a lot of information

130
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Most of the art products now

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Are designed for large exhibitions

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't want it

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I want to be small and beautiful

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And then there are things to appreciate and use

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Anyone who is interested in art

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Can come to me

137
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Choose art according to your needs

138
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Art is this thing

139
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's just that it's not separated

140
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Everyone can use it

141
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Are you listening to me?

142
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Good idea

143
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What about you?

144
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I

145
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Have my own arrangement

146
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's eat

147
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm going to eat

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to eat

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm going to eat

150
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm going to eat

151
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm going to eat

152
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is for you

153
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You can use it when you need money

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't want it

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You think I'm a duck?

156
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You will use a lot of money when you start a business

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Just take it as an investment

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm going to work

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Take it

160
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's enough to keep money

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Boss

162
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Go back

163
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That snake is sold out

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Last time a big tiger came

165
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Bought all your snakes

166
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm not here to buy snake seedlings this time

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm here to buy mother snakes

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Mother snake

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes, the last time you sold me that snake seedling

170
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I like it very much

171
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So this time

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I plan to sell that mother snake

173
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You help me burn the guard

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
See if you can burn that mother snake

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
impossible

176
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Absolutely impossible

177
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There are several ways to let go

178
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Burn out at once

179
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
How did you burn that snake seedling?

180
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's different

181
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This mother snake has a number

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Not a single one

183
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Then you see

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm looking for a similar mother snake

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Replace that mother snake

186
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This number of mother snakes is not small

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't think about it

188
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This matter is not credible

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Boss

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Come

191
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Look

192
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Boss, if you really see it

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
First, the number is not small

194
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Second, the snake seed has not changed

195
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Third, the value has not been reduced

196
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Can you really take that snake to do a DNA test?

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Boss

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You help me contact that person

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You don't have to worry about the rest

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll try my best

201
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
OK, I'll wait for your good news

202
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
go

203
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I really met a big deal today

204
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What a coincidence

205
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I also have one

206
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I have more money

207
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
People are stupid

208
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They said they would exchange it with me

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm also

210
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Still use Mina as a midway station

211
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The snake will faint at you

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He will send people to get the snake

213
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Pay the money

214
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Then we are not for nothing

215
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Madam, Miss Yueyue is here

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Aunt

217
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yueyue, come, come, come

218
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Come and sit

219
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yueyue, tell me the truth

220
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
How are you and Chi Cheng?

221
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We are fine

222
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You didn't have any conflicts, did you?

223
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Aunt, did Chi Cheng tell you something?

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No

225
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Since you came back

226
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I haven't seen him yet

227
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Aunt, don't worry

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We have always been good

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Everyone has his own temper

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We always use time to get along

231
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
As long as we are together

232
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We can get along

233
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You are so clear, Yueyue

234
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No wonder Chi Cheng likes you

235
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He has so many girls around him

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You are the first one he brought home

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You two, hurry up

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Pick a day to get the certificate

239
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Aunt, isn't it too fast?

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
No, no

241
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You will be Chi's daughter-in-law sooner or later

242
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You will go to his house tonight

243
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I will call him later

244
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Everyone, let me introduce

245
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
This is my partner, Mr. Wu

246
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Nice to meet you

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This is Mr. Wang from Sky Fog Design

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Mr. Wang, nice to meet you

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Mr. Wang

250
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Mr. Wang

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Nice to meet you

252
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Nice to meet you

253
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Sit down

254
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is Mr. Teng from Sky Fog Design

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sit down

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Mr. Teng

257
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Nice to meet you

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Nice to meet you

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And this is Mr. Liu from Fantasy Space

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Nice to meet you

261
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Nice to meet you

262
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Nice to meet you

263
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Sit down

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I know you

265
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I have said it all

266
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's drink

267
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Come on, let's drink

268
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Come on, let's drink

269
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Chi Shao

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Mr. Wu

271
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is our first meeting

272
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I want to propose a toast to you

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
OK, OK

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Cheers

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Cheers

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Here you are

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Take it easy

278
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I will trouble you

279
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
if you need anything

280
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I will treat you more

281
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Sit down

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Come on, Mr. Wu

283
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Cheers

284
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Sit down

285
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Give me the wine

286
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Be careful

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Miss Cang seems not to be there

288
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
OK, don't be so nervous

290
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Eat

291
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You didn't see the wind today?

292
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No

293
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Sit down

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What's wrong?

295
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Drunk?

296
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Drunk?

297
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Why are you so good to me?

298
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will answer the phone

299
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Just in time

300
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I will be back

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
OK

302
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't worry, Er Bao

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I won't hurt you

304
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
My girlfriend will be back in a while

305
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I will pay you back

306
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I will pay you back

307
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't worry, time stops

308
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Chi Chang

309
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You

310
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You

311
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You

312
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Eat

313
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why don't you eat?

314
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You don't eat

315
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I will kill you

316
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This kind of poison can kill snakes

317
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's a little bit toxic

318
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If you eat something like this

319
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's just a little bit of vomiting and diarrhea

320
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But it won't work if it lasts

321
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You can't save it if you want to

322
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He is bold

323
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But he is not smart

324
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He doesn't know the habits of small vinegar bags

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
How can he think of such a bad trick?

326
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
People who poison in this way

327
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
must be very frequent with me

328
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You mean Yue?

329
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yue

330
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I will know it in a few days

331
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
By the way

332
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Tell the uncle who is in charge of the restaurant

333
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The food is ready

334
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The snakes in it look like the original

335
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But the habits of life are different

336
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If it lasts long

337
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Your snakes will attack it

338
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Maybe they will be bitten to death

339
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Once there are a lot of dead snakes

340
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Those uncles will report it

341
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The chairman will do it

342
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I will do it

343
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Be patient

344
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Once they make a move

345
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They will do it

346
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't worry

347
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's been so long

348
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We just wait for this day

349
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't want to say that everything is fine

350
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But there will be no big trouble

351
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The snakes will definitely save it

352
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Go and see our snakes

353
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Long time no see

354
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I miss them

355
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Come and see this

356
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What is this?

357
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
There is more

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No more?

359
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Xiao Shuai

360
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Come and see

361
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Is it this one?

362
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Look

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's the same

364
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Exactly the same

365
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes

366
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I miss it

367
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Let me tell you

368
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
As long as there are snakes in Chicheng

369
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There are copies of them in the pot

370
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Shut up

371
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I

372
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Can you sell this snake to me?

373
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What are you joking about?

374
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Can I take your money?

375
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Li Wang

376
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Find a glass box

377
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Put this snake in

378
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And send it to the special clinic

379
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You don't ask me

380
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Why I want to buy this snake?

381
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I give you something

382
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You don't need to know why

383
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
As long as you need

384
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Thank you

385
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So fast

386
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You are worried about me?

387
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
He didn't do anything to you, right?

388
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Who am I?

389
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I can make him take advantage of me

390
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You ask him

391
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
He will give it to you

392
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes

393
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
No nonsense

394
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It seems that

395
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Guo Chengyu is nice to you

396
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Can he treat you well in Chicheng?

397
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Much better than Chicheng

398
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
If I find Chicheng to take the snake

399
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
He will give me one hundred percent

400
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No matter how much I like you

401
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
This can't be discussed in one go

402
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Guo Chengyu raises snakes for fun

403
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And Chicheng treats snakes as children

404
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
How can children send people?

405
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yes

406
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Different meanings

407
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
For Guo Chengyu

408
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Snake is snake

409
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But for Chicheng

410
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Snake is human

411
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's the only part of his inner thought

412
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Not everyone can burn it

413
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I can smell the three flavors

414
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Let's see the snake first

415
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Such a precious snake

416
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Must be worth a lot of money

417
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's put a fake one in first

418
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Anyway

419
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It will be killed by Chicheng's snake

420
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Can't let it be a big deal

421
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
If the snake can see it

422
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Chicheng will lose

423
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I have invested hundreds of thousands

424
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
For this plan

425
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Not bad

426
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
A man who is not talented

427
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
How can he spend so much money?

428
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Just think of it as a risk investment

429
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
After all

430
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
A man who can let us pay

431
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
A man who can steal money

432
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Must be worth it

433
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The plan is so smooth

434
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Why are you still unhappy?

435
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I don't know

436
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Just annoying

437
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't you think

438
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Chicheng saw the internal medicine bag

439
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Not only not angry

440
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Will you still indulge Yueyue?

441
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
If she indulges

442
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's not Chicheng

443
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
In Chicheng's heart

444
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The snake is the most important

445
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Do you know why you are suffering?

446
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
In fact

447
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You don't care about Yueyue anymore

448
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What you are entangled in

449
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Is Chicheng's attitude

450
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You see, for that snake

451
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
He would rather stay with Yueyue

452
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You don't feel good

453
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
As long as Chicheng opens his mouth

454
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Give up that snake

455
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Everything can be solved

456
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But he is not

457
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So you can only put in effort

458
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
To get that snake back

459
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And see him and others

460
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Kiss me

461
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So you feel wronged

462
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You feel bad

463
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You are not willing to

464
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
For his love of snakes

465
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And suffer

466
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Am I right?

467
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You said I was right

468
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You are so smart

469
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Get out

470
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You are so smart

471
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You are so stupid

472
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
As long as you can get that snake back

473
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No matter what you do

474
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Can I do it?

475
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I spent money to let you come

476
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Is it a plan for you to think about this stupid?

477
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
He doesn't eat things given by outsiders

478
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Stop talking

479
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just do it

480
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I want to see his body

481
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That's too risky

482
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We can't do it

483
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The price

484
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Twice

485
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I really want to see you now

486
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm not kidding you

487
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The situation has changed

488
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The caretaker of the snake

489
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Can't contact

490
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The chef of the canteen also changed a bottle

491
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
They must have found something wrong with your snake

492
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
They are trying to fix it

493
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Wait a minute

494
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
How many years have you heard recently?

495
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's earlier than I thought

496
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Just changed more than twenty snakes

497
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
They found one

498
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Ok, ok, ok, I know

499
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You say

500
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This is not urgent

501
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
When will you see?

502
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Brother Wu

503
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The shopkeeper can't contact

504
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I went to his place

505
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I found that his behavior was all moved out

506
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I feel this kid is going to run away

507
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
There must be something wrong with the hideout

508
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I want to send more people to watch at the door

509
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What do you think?

510
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You can do it by yourself

511
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Don't worry about the money

512
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
No one will be hurt

513
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Sit here

514
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Let me see

515
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I want to see you

516
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Where are you?

517
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm going to the city

518
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm so stupid

519
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Why don't you talk?

520
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I happen to be coming to you

521
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm at your door

522
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Ok

523
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Something is wrong with the hideout

524
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So big

525
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Move away

526
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Shensheng really broke the range

527
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So easy

528
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I have a lot of good tricks

529
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You hit

530
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You hit

531
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
No lock

532
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
What to do?

533
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Take it out or kill it here?

534
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Kill it here

535
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You do it

536
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Can you do it?

537
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I do it

538
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
What are you doing?

539
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
What are you doing?

540
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Don't play this with me

541
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Get out if you want to live

542
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'll kill you

543
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You

544
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Are you ok?

545
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm fine

546
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm fine

547
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's poisonous

548
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Who let you come?

549
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't talk

550
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Take my money to cure the disease

551
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Or buy a coffin with his money?

552
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You choose

553
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Your girlfriend

554
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
She can't stand you raising snakes

555
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
She asked us to kill you

556
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You and her can die

557
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Wake up

558
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Wake up

559
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Hold on

560
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:55,600
You put the

561
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,000
That pack of sweet potato medicine, right?

562
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What sweet potato medicine?

563
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That sweet potato medicine

564
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Won't hurt the small bag too much

565
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But it will

566
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Have an effect

567
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
People who use this way to make medicine

568
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Either don't know about the small bag

569
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Or they know too much

570
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I didn't know how much Yueyue knew about the small bag

571
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But she chose to kill the snake

572
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So the answer is only this

573
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
When did you find out?

574
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Since you told me the small bag was in trouble

575
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I know you didn't poison

576
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You want to remind me to protect the small bag

577
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
If today I'm late

578
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You will be the one who get hurt

579
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You want to hurt me

580
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So I feel uncomfortable, right?

581
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Can you stop your nonsense

582
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Stop being so dramatic

583
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Then I did it for the small bag

584
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I was really scared just now

585
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I was really scared just now

586
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I was really scared just now

587
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I am not okay

588
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
You have a little smile

589
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
What's wrong?

590
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I feel bad for you

591
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I feel really good

592
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
OK

593
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Then I'll show you

594
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm not afraid of you

595
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm not afraid of you

596
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm not afraid of you

597
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm not afraid of you

598
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Don't do this kind of thing again

599
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
OK?

600
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You do anything for me

601
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It has nothing to do with whether I like you

602
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Even if you don't do it every day

603
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I still like you

604
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What if

605
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I lied to you

606
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and fooled you

607
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Why?

608
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Because you owe me

609
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I can sleep with you

610
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You

611
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I really never wanted to sleep with someone like this

612
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You show your love

613
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and still go straight

614
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You are all big men

615
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Is it interesting for me to lie to you?

616
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I really never wanted to sleep with someone like this

617
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Eat

618
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I am not afraid of you

619
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm not afraid of you

620
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm not afraid of you

621
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Your aesthetic

622
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Can it really be?

623
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Your flower tea and cloth

624
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Can't get rid of it

625
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You don't know at all

626
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
how high and comfortable the value of those clothes are

627
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And, it's a lot of money to do art

628
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You won't feel bad about the client's money

629
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,960
the imperial part of the billion meanings of poetry!
