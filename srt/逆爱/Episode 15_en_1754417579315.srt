1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
Let's go.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
What about them?

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,520
Are they waiting for an answer?

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
When the breeze blows through my face,

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,680
it blows through my hair.

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,720
They're quietly telling me some words.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,120
The sound of spring is like the sound of flowers.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,640
Is it all you?

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Is it all you?

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,640
The autumn leaves are in the winter, the four seasons are changing.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Is it all you?

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Is it all you?

13
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Why did you leave suddenly?

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Why did you leave seven years ago?

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
You have the nerve to open a room with him.

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
You have the nerve to stay and commit a crime.

17
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Since you've left, why did you come back?

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
I have the nerve.

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,640
I'm afraid that you'll kill Liu Sheng.

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
I'm afraid that you'll kill Liu Sheng.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
I'm afraid that you'll kill Liu Sheng.

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm afraid that you'll kill Liu Sheng.

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm too lazy to fool you.

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
I think you're dirty.

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
I've been fooled by you.

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
I've at least slept once.

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
You're a bastard.

28
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Yes, I'm a bastard.

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm the one who ran away.

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
I've been thinking about you for seven years.

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,640
It's me.

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Maybe you've lost your appetite.

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
No one can satisfy me anymore.

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
At least, please satisfy me once.

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Give it to me.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
I'll just take care of it.

37
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
I'll give you trouble.

38
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm back.

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
You're back.

40
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Why are you blowing so much?

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,640
I want to blow every tongue in your tongue.

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Make a touch.

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
How can you think that?

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
No, I just think it's fun.

45
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Okay.

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
I'll wash my hands.

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
When you go back today,

48
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,640
you must be at the hospital for twenty hours.

49
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Okay.

50
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Why do you have to say it in person?

51
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
It's important.

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
I heard that Wang Shuo is hospitalized.

53
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Why is he hospitalized?

54
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,640
I don't know the specific reason.

55
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Guo Chong also told me once.

56
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Why don't you go and see him?

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I go to see him?

58
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,640
What's this?

59
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Sit down.

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Why can't you go and see him?

61
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,640
You go as a family member.

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
It's good to show your power.

63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,640
He didn't say he was going to the front yard.

64
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Why should I go and find him?

65
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Why don't you go back to the front yard?

66
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Stay abroad and live well.

67
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
It's half a year after you come back.

68
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Half a year?

69
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Yes.

70
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Do you think he has any idea?

71
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
He didn't show up for half a year.

72
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
He's hiding it well.

73
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
It's about his idea.

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
I'm afraid he's not capable.

75
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
He's quite confident.

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
I'm not going anyway.

77
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
I'm not interested in him.

78
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Hello.

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
May I ask which ward Wang Shuo is in?

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Wait a minute. I'll check it for you.

81
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
He's in ward 309.

82
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Go straight in and check the second ward.

83
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Okay, thank you.

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
You're welcome.

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
One pair of Ks.

86
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
One pair of two.

87
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
One pair of two?

88
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Let me think.

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Think.

90
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Wang Zhihao.

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
How is it?

92
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Wang Shuo doesn't look sick at all.

93
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Let's go.

94
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Wang, you're so good at playing cards.

95
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,640
It's just a hand.

96
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
You should play more.

97
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm leaving.

98
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Sorry.

99
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
It's okay.

100
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Who are you looking for?

101
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
I...

102
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
Wang...

103
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Wang...

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
I've finished.

105
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
I've finished.

106
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
I have something to do. I'll go first.

107
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Isn't this the new bus?

108
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Hello.

109
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Where are you?

110
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
I'm with a client outside.

111
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
I'll talk to you later.

112
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
By the way,

113
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I have a business meeting tonight.

114
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,640
I'll be back later.

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Okay.

116
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I'll see you later.

117
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Bye.

118
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Bye.

119
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Bye.

120
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Bye.

121
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Bye.

122
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Bye.

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Bye.

124
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Bye.

125
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Bye.

126
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Bye.

127
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Bye.

128
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Bye.

129
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
I don't know why

130
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
it's so serious this time.

131
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
If I didn't have the guts,

132
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
I wouldn't have bothered you

133
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
to come to the hospital with me.

134
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm just afraid

135
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
that it will be more troublesome

136
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
if the disease is delayed.

137
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Don't think too much, auntie.

138
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
It's not troublesome at all.

139
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Besides, I'm in charge of the outside.

140
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
I can come out at any time.

141
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
No. 127, you can start the check-up.

142
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Auntie,

143
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
please sit down and have a rest. I'll go and save her.

144
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Okay.

145
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Is the patient your mother?

146
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Yes.

147
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Doctor,

148
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
is my mother seriously ill?

149
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
You have to be prepared.

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Her condition is not optimistic.

151
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
The initial diagnosis is

152
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
a first-line cancer.

153
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
After the check-up

154
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
of our medical records,

155
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.

156
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
It's dry and hard.

157
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
The future is not optimistic.

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
The meaning of the operation is not big.

159
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
First-line cancer.

160
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Doctor,

161
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
is there

162
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
any other way

163
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
to make her

164
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
suffer less

165
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
and live longer?

166
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
This cancer is worse

167
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
than other bad diseases.

168
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
And she's old.

169
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
The chemotherapy

170
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
may bring her psychological burden

171
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
and play a role.

172
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
So we should try to reduce the pain

173
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
to improve her quality of life.

174
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Your family

175
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
should spend more time with her.

176
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Maybe it can make her live longer.

177
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I understand.

178
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Doctor,

179
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
please check

180
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
if there's any other better treatment.

181
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
We'll try our best.

182
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Thank you.

183
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Chi,

184
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
don't tell her yet.

185
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
If she knows,

186
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
she'll feel bad

187
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
from now on.

188
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Chi.

189
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Chi.

190
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
My son,

191
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
you're back.

192
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
You can't be sick

193
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
if you're not sick.

194
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
You can't be sick even if you don't scold yourself.

195
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I'm not sick.

196
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
You can't come back.

197
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Don't lie to me.

198
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
You lied to me after you got out from the hospital.

199
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Zhang Bao is still awake.

200
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,600
You know it's late.

201
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,040
Where did you go?

202
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,240
I didn't lie to you.

203
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Yang Zhi is sick.

204
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,040
He got that kind of...

205
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
I said I'll go with my client.

206
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Your client is really hard to deal with.

207
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,840
You're always with him at this time.

208
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,040
Yes.

209
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,240
He said one,

210
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,840
I don't dare to say it.

211
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,440
If he doesn't let me leave,

212
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,440
I can only do it.

213
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I'll go back to the clinic.

214
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,440
Fei Fei.

215
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,040
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,640
I won't let you wait for so long.

217
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Don't touch me!

220
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,640
Let me sleep for a while.

221
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,640
The more the enemy is light,

222
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,440
the more I can't be in a mess.

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I've been in the hospital for a while.

224
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,840
I can be your reward.

225
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,440
But I can't be angry for nothing.

226
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,840
You can sleep on the sofa tonight.

227
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Are you frozen?

228
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm not.

229
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,840
Let me tell you.

230
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,640
I'm not forgiving you.

231
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm just afraid you'll freeze to death.

232
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,440
I know.

233
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
You are feeling Thai?

234
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,440
I know that as my Flagship.

235
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,240
But this is for you to defend yourself.

236
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,640
adhesive

237
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,840
All because I am his ex-boyfriend.

238
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,440
I was wrong on the first place.

239
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,660
They reported as wrongs.

240
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,220
I had no intention to go for it.

241
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,260
ever-coming

242
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Hello.

243
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,840
Mr. Chi.

244
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,400
Please move your stuff out of your room.

245
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm renting out my room.

246
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
Okay, I'll go over later.

247
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Thank you.

248
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Weiwei...

249
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
It's a bit sweet.

250
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,600
I'll go to the suburb later.

251
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,480
Isn't the stuff in the room with the landlord?

252
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Let's go together.

253
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I won't go.

254
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I won't go.

255
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,040
I'll go to eat with Xiao Shuai later.

256
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,520
Didn't the snake move out?

257
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,920
I'll go to the suburb later.

258
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
I'll go to eat with Xiao Shuai later.

259
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
I'll go to eat with Xiao Shuai later.

260
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
I've been here for months.

261
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
You just don't know.

262
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Get the hell out of here!

263
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Get out?

264
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Stop talking nonsense.

265
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Get out of here.

266
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
I'll tell you.

267
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
You're like this.

268
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
I thought you were worried about me getting sick.

269
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Stop it, okay?

270
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,440
When you moved out, you left a snake egg.

271
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
It's this one.

272
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Is it cute?

273
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Why are you always with me?

274
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Where's Shu Chuang?

275
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
He went home to work.

276
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Why didn't you go with him?

277
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't want to go.

278
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Did you go to the hospital to see Wang Shuai?

279
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
What do you think of him?

280
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Is he very ordinary?

281
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
He's not normal.

282
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
He's just a little bit of a kid.

283
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
He's not normal.

284
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Is he very ordinary?

285
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
He's not ordinary.

286
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
He's just a little bit of a kid.

287
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
He's also pretty handsome.

288
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Can he be as handsome as you?

289
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
He can.

290
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
I saw Chi Cheng at the hospital yesterday.

291
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Chi Cheng didn't go home for a day.

292
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
I called him.

293
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,920
But he lied to me that he was meeting a client.

294
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Is there any misunderstanding?

295
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
What misunderstanding?

296
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I told Xiao Gang.

297
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
He said he hadn't seen Chi Cheng for a day.

298
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Chi Cheng must have been in the hospital.

299
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
He should have seen it.

300
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
But he didn't dare to say it.

301
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Otherwise, how could he apologize to me when he came back?

302
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
It's not like Chi Cheng's style.

303
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,160
If he really cares about Wang Shuai and wants to see him,

304
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
he will go there openly.

305
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
If he's really guilty,

306
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
he won't let you know.

307
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
That makes sense.

308
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
You didn't ask him?

309
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Why would I ask him?

310
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Why would I ask him?

311
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm pretending not to know.

312
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Many misunderstandings are caused by this.

313
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Many misunderstandings are caused by this.

314
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Many misunderstandings are caused by this.

315
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
The teacher doesn't solve them.

316
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
The teacher doesn't solve them.

317
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
The trust he should have is gone.

318
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
If you're really worried,

319
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
then do a surprise check.

320
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
He's packing up now.

321
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
You're not here.

322
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
If something's wrong with them,

323
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,400
maybe they're having an affair.

324
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Chen... Chen Qu.

325
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Chen... Chen Qu.

326
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
If he's really in the bag,

327
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
then we'll just break up.

328
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Don't make a fuss.

329
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
He's like you can't leave him.

330
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Fine.

331
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
I'll go.

332
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
It's best to be in bed.

333
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
We'll have a single party right away.

334
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Wang Shuai.

335
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Let me ask you one last time.

336
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,640
Why didn't you show up when you came back half a year ago?

337
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
I often show up here.

338
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Right?

339
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
It's just that you didn't come.

340
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
I've moved away my snake.

341
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Why should I come back?

342
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
You've moved away your heart.

343
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
How could you have found me?

344
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Hurry and go back.

345
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
I heard that

346
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
you killed the Great Yellow Dragon

347
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
for that Wu Suowei.

348
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Who told you that?

349
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Fei Fei did.

350
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
She told me herself.

351
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
You're not human.

352
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
You killed the Great Yellow Dragon for that Wu Suowei?

353
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
You killed the Great Yellow Dragon for that Wu Suowei?

354
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Who told you that?

355
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Fei Fei told me herself.

356
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
She told me herself.

357
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
You killed it!

358
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Wang Shuai!

359
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
From the moment you started doing these things,

360
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
these things should all die.

361
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
You're crazy!

362
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
This is poisonous!

363
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
You don't know, do you?

364
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Actually, humans are poisonous too.

365
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Your mouth is still so sweet.

366
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
You're so sweet.

367
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
You're so sweet.

368
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
You're so sweet.

369
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
You're so sweet.

370
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
You're so sweet.

371
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
You're so sweet.

372
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
You're so sweet.

373
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
You're so sweet.

374
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
You're so sweet.

375
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
You're so sweet.

376
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
You're so sweet.

377
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
You're so sweet.

378
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
You're so sweet.

379
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
You're so sweet.

380
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
You were always cute.

381
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
You were always mean.

382
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
You were always kind.

383
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
You were always nice.

384
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
It's all right.

385
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
It's all right.

386
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,860
It's all right.

387
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,780
I'm fine.

388
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,420
Are you crazy?

389
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,820
Shi Chang!

390
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,900
You only asked me why I've been gone for so many years.

391
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,420
You never asked me

392
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,780
why I did those things with Guo Chengyu.

393
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,820
I'm sorry.

394
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,940
Hello?

395
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,220
Are you Zhang Liya's son?

396
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,460
Yes.

397
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,940
Come to the hospital.

398
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,820
Okay, I'll be right there.

399
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,900
You know.

400
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,140
You now hurt my feelings.

401
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,820
I'm so sorry.

402
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,160
Directly he fired me.

403
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,340
What a saint.

404
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,620
he's truly over you.

405
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,300
Good.

406
00:24:41,300 --> 00:25:06,540
until I'm alive.

407
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,900
when you want to expel me.

408
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,380
I'm sorry.

409
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,680
I'm sorry for what I've done.

410
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,140
Shi...

411
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,140
I will never let you go so easily.

412
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
Who is it?

413
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Oh my god.

414
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
Why is he here?

415
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
There's no place to stay.

416
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
I came here to see you.

417
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
How do you know my house is here?

418
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,140
There is Chengyu.

419
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
How can I not know where your house is?

420
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
Chengyu and Chi Cheng are not here today.

421
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
We are not familiar with each other.

422
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
Why do you come to my house?

423
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
I like you.

424
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
I also like Wu Yanzu.

425
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
I'm also in my own house.

426
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,140
It smells so good.

427
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
No wonder Chengyu likes you.

428
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
Get up.

429
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,140
You give me a kiss.

430
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,140
Get up.

431
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,140
Please.

432
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Let me stay in your house for a night.

433
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
Please.

434
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,140
Please let me stay in your house for a night.

435
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,140
Please let me stay in your house for a night.

436
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,140
Wang Shuo is here.

437
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,140
Then Dawei should be with Chi Cheng.

438
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Forget it.

439
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Keep it.

440
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Don't bother him.

441
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
Please let me stay.

442
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,140
Aunt, you are awake.

443
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Chi.

444
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140
You didn't tell Da Qiong, right?

445
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Don't worry.

446
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,140
You have a brain problem.

447
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
What's wrong?

448
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Why do you lock the door?

449
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
You are disturbing the people here in the morning.

450
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
There are so many hotels and homestays outside.

451
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Why don't you go to live there?

452
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,140
Why do you have to save hundreds of yuan in my house?

453
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
I hate it when people touch my things.

454
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,140
Your food is so delicious.

455
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Give me a bite.

456
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
What's wrong?

457
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Chi Cheng had a good taste.

458
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,140
Why don't you say Chengyu has a good taste?

459
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,140
Because Chengyu likes you.

460
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
That's why I came to your house for a night.

461
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,140
Among so many people, you are the smartest.

462
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,140
Xiaochuan.

463
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
Why are you here?

464
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Good morning.

465
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
I gave you Jiang Xiaochuan's address.

466
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,140
It's not for this purpose.

467
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
Then I have this purpose.

468
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,140
I'm leaving.

469
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,140
Bye.

470
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,140
Get out of here.

471
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Why is she here?

472
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,140
Are you angry that she sleeps with me or that I sleep with her?

473
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,140
What do you think?

474
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
It's so late yesterday.

475
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,140
I can't let her stay here.

476
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,140
Don't talk to her in the future.

477
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,140
I'm telling you.

478
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,140
Who knows what she wants to do?

479
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:29,140
She asked me for your address and said that she liked you when she first saw you.

480
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
She wanted to send you some food.

481
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Who knows she...

482
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,140
And you let her stay at your house for a night.

483
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,140
I...

484
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,140
I didn't stay at your house for a night.

485
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,140
I stayed at your house for a night.

486
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,140
Xiaochuan.

487
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,140
I may have to go on a business trip.

488
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
But I swear.

489
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,140
It's really about the company.

490
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,140
Well, listen to me.

491
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,140
If Uncle Wang comes again, you must open the door for him.

492
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
Don't let him do it on purpose.

493
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,140
Do you hear me?

494
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
Okay.

495
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
I'll go to the bathroom.

496
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Okay.

497
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,140
Where's Wu Suowei?

498
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,140
Why is your man here?

499
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,140
Wasn't he with you yesterday?

500
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
He left at nine o'clock yesterday.

501
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
And then where did he go?

502
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,140
And then?

503
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,140
And then he went to you.

504
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
I don't know where he went.

505
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
I don't know.

506
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,140
What can I say?

507
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
I'm not sure.

508
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
If he's not here,

509
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
I'll have to go find him.

510
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,140
I'm so sorry.

512
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
I'm sorry.

513
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
I'm sorry.

514
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Where's my man?

515
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,140
I'll go to the bathroom.

516
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
I'll be there in a minute.

517
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,140
I'm sorry.

518
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,140
I'm sorry.

519
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
I'm sorry.

520
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,140
I'm sorry.

521
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,140
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
I'm sorry.

525
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
Bye bye.

526
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,140
Where did you go yesterday?

527
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Home.

528
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
With my mom.

529
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
Impossible.

530
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
Why not?

531
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Bye bye.

532
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,820
Did you go to my...

533
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,780
My grandma's...

534
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
To her office.

535
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,300
We can't make it clear, right?

536
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,180
Did you see something?

537
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,060
I should have.

538
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,140
Weiwei.

539
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,140
Listen to me, okay?

540
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
Tell me.

541
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,620
Why didn't you go home last night?

542
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,540
I didn't go home last night because I...

543
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,460
I went to see a client.

544
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I'm sorry.

545
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,140
Sorry.

546
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,860
Sorry again.

547
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,140
I made you say those three words.

548
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,940
It's like killing you.

549
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
Now,

550
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,060
you say it twice in three days.

551
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
I'm sorry.

552
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,580
I'm sorry.

553
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
I'm sorry.

554
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,460
I'm sorry.

555
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,540
I'm sorry.

556
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,620
I'm sorry.

557
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,700
I'm sorry.

558
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Weiwei.

559
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,940
I'll explain it to you.

560
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,660
It's not a big deal.

561
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,700
You go to see a client.

562
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,180
I should be happy.

563
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,740
Can't you listen to me?

564
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,700
Why are you in such a hurry to leave the hospital?

565
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,980
It's no use staying in the hospital.

566
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,740
Da Qiong knows.

567
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,140
He should be suspicious.

568
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,660
Thank you for your hard work.

569
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
Mr. Wu.

570
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,580
A client wants to see you.

571
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
Who?

572
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,940
Mr. Wang Shuang.

573
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,060
Mr. Wang Shuang.

574
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,140
Mr. Wang Shuang.

575
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Mr. Wang Shuang.

576
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,300
Mr. Wang Shuang.

577
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Mr. Wang Shuang.

578
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,460
Mr. Wang Shuang.

579
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Mr. Wang Shuang.

580
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
Mr. Wang Shuang.

581
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
Wang Shuang?

582
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,380
Yes.

583
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
Let him in.

584
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Okay.

585
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Hello.

586
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
I'm Wang Shuang.

587
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
I'm not coming.

588
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,620
Then play again.

589
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,820
What are we playing?

590
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,060
I'll definitely let you win the next game.

591
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,220
I can't beat you.

592
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,940
You should play with someone else.

593
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,300
I'm not playing.

594
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,900
I really want to tell you

595
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,500
that there is no such thing as the sunset and the sea of clouds.

596
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,460
If today is over,

597
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:27,540
I won't come back and change the week.

598
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,900
I still want to tell you

599
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,780
that there is no fear of the stars and the mountains.

600
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,180
When the sun rises and sets,

601
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,420
I'll wait for you in my eyes.

602
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:58,100
There is no fear of time.

603
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,980
The last night on earth,

604
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:12,100
I just want to confess to you.

605
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:19,900
I'll use a heart to go through the end of the last day.

606
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:27,860
Maybe there is no regret.

607
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,780
The last night on earth,

608
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:41,740
when life turns into dust,

609
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:49,300
I'll hold you tight in the sea and in the sky.

610
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:56,700
I'll hold you tight without hesitation.

611
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,980
leaving King Kong.
