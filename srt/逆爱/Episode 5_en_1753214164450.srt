1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
flavoured quit

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows through my face and blows through my hair

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They're quietly telling me a few words

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The sound of spring is growing, the words are being spoken

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is it all you? It's all you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The autumn leaves are in the winter, the four seasons are changing

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's the same as you

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's the same as you

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 16

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hello, uncle and aunt

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Aunt

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sit down

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Come, come, come, sit down Yueyue, sit here

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Auntie, this skin care product has a very good anti-shake effect

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're so considerate, Yueyue

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Uncle, I asked Chi Cheng specifically

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He said you like this tea

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're welcome, you're welcome

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yueyue, Chi Cheng has an older sister who is abroad all year round

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll introduce you to her when she comes back

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's great, I'm looking forward to it

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look at this girl, she's beautiful and has a good personality

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right?

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes, yes

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I like her more and more

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Chi Cheng

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Treat her well

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's so easy to win

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yueyue, come and play more if you have time

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You don't know how nervous I was when I came to see your parents today

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I didn't expect them to be so easy-going

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
When will we go back to see my parents?

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's talk about it

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll ask the driver to send you back

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Miss Yue, this way

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Brother Chi, we still haven't heard from the snakes recently

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you think I'm scary?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, why are you asking all of a sudden?

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I feel that someone is afraid to get close to me

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sister Yue is afraid of you, she won't let you touch her

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It has nothing to do with her

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why do you still have this kind of trouble?

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's just a wall

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What's wrong with you?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If I want to stay on the wall, why should I ask you?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think there are only two possibilities

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Either it's too pure or it's a ghost in the heart

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Dr. Jiang, you finished the medicine you gave Guo Shao last month

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He asked me to get more

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There are medicines in every store

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why do you have to come to me?

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I just want to give you the dessert

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll go get it

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why doesn't he come?

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't you want to see him?

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He comes to harass me when I don't want to see him

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's invisible when I want to gossip with him

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay, here's the medicine

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Pay the money and take this away

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What a pity

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can only throw it away

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, don't waste it

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This can be eaten by children

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right?

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
By the way, Guo Shao also told me to keep an eye on you

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Be careful not to let him down

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The mahjong is over

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The mahjong is over

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The queen of the prize pool

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Find the gold city

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Call the cat

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The gold captain and so on

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
High rate of compensation

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The reward frequency is high

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There are many opportunities to take revenge

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hurry up to join

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Aomensin Peking Entertainment City 772772com

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have something to do today

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll talk to you another day

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't say half of it

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Aunt Li, don't be angry

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is the third time I've been to the hospital

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
In the future, communicate with the children

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you, doctor

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Aunt Zhang

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Your value is a little high

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't do much farming when you go home

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And you are a wound

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't touch water when you go back

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I know, thank you

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't stay here

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know where he is

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know where he is

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't know where he is

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't know where he is

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know where he is

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's twelve o'clock

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's twelve o'clock

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Still not leaving

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Dr. Jiang

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You said I started to go to you from now on

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Before the guard comes back

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Can we end

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He went home

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is stupid

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
what

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll ask

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is Wu Suowei here?

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
May I ask you

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
Hello, aunt. I'm her colleague,

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,680
Chi Cheng.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Just call me Chi.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,160
Chi, come on.

118
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,960
Come on in.

119
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,400
Da Qiu has been sick for a week.

120
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,880
He's been lying in bed.

121
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
He hasn't been out since he came back.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
It doesn't matter.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
You're secretly learning new skills?

124
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,480
What are you doing?

125
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
Let's practice.

126
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,000
Come on.

127
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,640
I accidentally hit it.

128
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,080
What are you doing?

129
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
What are you doing, Third Uncle?

130
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm here to see you.

131
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,520
You're sick.

132
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,080
Aunt said you hadn't been out for days.

133
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,120
Don't touch me.

134
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,400
Da Qiu, it's almost done.

135
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,680
Come out and eat.

136
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,120
Is it done?

137
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
Come down now.

138
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,160
Mom,

139
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,160
why are you cooking so much?

140
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
There are guests here.

141
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,600
Aunt, let me help you.

142
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,640
No, no.

143
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,680
It's all oil and salt.

144
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,560
It'll be ready soon.

145
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,200
Da Qiu, take Chi in.

146
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,200
Okay.

147
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,680
Aunt, you...

148
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,560
No, thanks.

149
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
You used to wear it?

150
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,120
Yes.

151
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,200
Don't say that.

152
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,880
You look cute in open pants.

153
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,520
Is this your dad?

154
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,080
He's been gone for 16 years.

156
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,320
It must be hard for me to take care of you for 16 years.

157
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,880
My mom

158
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,480
has been careful of the meaning of life.

159
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,880
I want to make a lot of money

160
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,160
for the sake of her.

161
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,720
I want to take care of her.

162
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,880
But I've been in the same bad company

163
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,240
for three times.

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,800
Don't worry.

165
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,120
Just go ahead.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,920
I'll take care of you.

167
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
It seems that

168
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
he's quite

169
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,440
handsome.

170
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,920
Come on.

171
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,160
Let's eat.

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,280
Chi, come on.

173
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,480
Don't be shy.

174
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,960
Chi Chi,

175
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,360
this is braised pork.

176
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,000
Thank you, aunt.

177
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,960
Try it.

178
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,600
Is it good?

179
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,520
It's good, aunt.

180
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,040
You're really good at cooking.

181
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,040
Really?

182
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,960
Then eat more if it's good.

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,800
Da Qiu,

184
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,320
you're eating with Chi.

185
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,080
Why are you doing this?

186
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,040
I...

187
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,760
Thank you.

188
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,360
Aunt,

189
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
you've cooked so many dishes.

190
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,440
Thank you.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,920
Okay, okay.

192
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,920
You eat more.

193
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,520
Okay.

194
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,400
You're so skinny.

195
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,040
Thank you.

196
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,320
Chi, come on.

197
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Have some rice wine

198
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
that I made myself.

199
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,120
It's not worth much.

200
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,880
Don't mind it.

201
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,080
You're so arrogant.

202
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,480
What do you want?

203
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,160
You're so good at cooking.

204
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,320
No one can drink it.

205
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,960
Xuan.

206
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,160
Chi,

207
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,440
eat more meat.

208
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,600
Aunt,

209
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,840
you don't eat meat?

210
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,960
My mom is a good student.

211
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,840
She can't eat

212
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,000
so many high-quality dishes.

213
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,040
You young people

214
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,000
eat more meat.

215
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,960
Okay.

216
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,440
Uncle,

217
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,640
my graduation street is over there.

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
I can't go in.

219
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:11,360
They can still

220
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,920
teach me

221
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,040
to cook in the afternoon.

222
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,880
I'm in class now.

223
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,600
Really?

224
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,440
You don't get this?

225
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,040
You're pretty good at this.

226
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,360
I don't think I'm in class.

227
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
I go to class out.

228
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm in a bad place

229
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
so I can't go there.

230
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,480
Since I Search,

231
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,320
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,840
Auntie.

233
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,320
I don't think

234
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
I'll bother you two.

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,760
No, you won't.

236
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm afraid you'll feel wronged.

237
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,960
Let's play a game tonight.

238
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
No.

239
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
Not at all.

240
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,080
I'll take back what I said to him.

241
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,040
Listen to me.

242
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,040
Take care of him.

243
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,400
Eat.

244
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
Your pants are too small.

245
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,760
Who cares?

246
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
It's just a cardigan.

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
My pants when I was a kid.

248
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,480
Sleep.

249
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,240
I'll sleep here tonight.

250
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,080
You'll sleep there.

251
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,920
You treat guests like this?

252
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,320
What?

253
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
You're mad?

254
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,200
Auntie.

255
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm warning you.

256
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,720
Don't talk nonsense.

257
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,800
Sponge the fan?".

258
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,080
turmeric

259
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,720
Good.

260
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,400
You win.

261
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,640
You sleep here.

262
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,100
I'll sleep here.

263
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,920
I hope to make you special love.

264
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,880
ing

265
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,140
In Green Pavilion

266
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,260
Do you want to drink?

267
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
Pink favourite

268
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,700
Pink favourite

269
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,740
Qin Ymusi

270
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,500
give it to me

271
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,060
Pink favourite

272
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,060
I'm asking if the floor is hard.

273
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
It's pretty hard.

274
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
What are you doing?

275
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
Go upstairs.

276
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
Okay.

277
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,060
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,060
Where are you going?

279
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,060
I'm taking you to a fun place.

280
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Can you do it?

281
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Can you ride a bike?

282
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
Get in the car.

283
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Shan'an.

284
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,060
You're taking me to this place to fight with you in the wild, right?

285
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Get lost. Who's fighting with you in the wild?

286
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Shut up. Don't talk.

287
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
It's a sword.

288
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
How far is it?

289
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
A little further.

290
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
A little further.

291
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
We're here.

292
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Right here. Get off the bike.

293
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Come on.

294
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
Come here. Right here.

295
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
Right here.

296
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
I'll take it back to Xiao Si to change it.

297
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
What era is this?

298
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
You're using this soil to make a?

299
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
What do you know?

300
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,060
The? in the ground is more stupid than the? in the city.

301
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
It doesn't avoid people.

302
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
I'm telling you.

303
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,060
There's a bunch of stupid? in my house.

304
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,060
They fly into the smoke every day.

305
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
They don't know it's empty inside.

306
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
They fall on my bed.

307
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,060
You're a snake too.

308
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
You must have a lot of ways to catch birds.

309
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
This is the way.

310
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
Open it.

311
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,060
It's really stupid.

312
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,060
Why does it feel like it's taking back?

313
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,060
Look.

314
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,060
These are all our corn fields.

315
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,060
It's pretty big.

316
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
Don't look over there.

317
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
Not over there.

318
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,060
It's not big enough.

319
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
I'll introduce it to you.

320
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,060
This is the early corn we grow.

321
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Early corn is a kind of corn that can be picked and cooked in a short time.

322
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,060
You can eat it now.

323
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,060
It's just not too ripe.

324
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
It's sweet. Try it.

325
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,060
What are you doing?

326
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,060
I'm going to eat it.

327
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
I'm going to eat it.

328
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
I'm going to eat it.

329
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
I'm going to eat it.

330
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,060
You don't know you resigned, do you?

331
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
How dare you say that?

332
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
If you don't let me kiss you,

333
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
I'll show you everything.

334
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,060
I'm going to eat it.

335
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
You sent Xiaochun away?

336
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,060
Really?

337
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,060
Who sent this?

338
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Xiaochun sent so many gifts when she left.

339
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
She said it was her first time coming to our house.

340
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,060
She felt embarrassed.

341
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
This child is so thoughtful.

342
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
She sent so many.

343
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,060
Daqiu.

344
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,060
Don't be with Xiaochun anymore.

345
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
What's wrong, mom?

346
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,060
Didn't you just say she was pretty good?

347
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,060
I just think she's too good to say that.

348
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
Think about it.

349
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
If you're with her,

350
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
who else would look down on you?

351
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,060
Mom, you're really my horse.

352
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Xiaochun.

353
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
How's the school?

354
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
What do you think?

355
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,060
I'm going back to my room first.

356
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
Okay.

357
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
I'll go.

358
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
Xiaochun.

359
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
I have the sugar man.

360
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,060
I took it away.

361
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Really?

362
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Why did she take my sugar man?

363
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
She did it on purpose.

364
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
She took your sugar man away.

365
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,060
You can only go to her.

366
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
Why did you take my sugar man?

367
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,060
You can't take it all.

368
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Right?

369
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
It's my girlfriend.

370
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Xiaochun.

371
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Help me prepare a good dress.

372
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
The more handsome the better.

373
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
I'm going to the infirmary tomorrow.

374
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
If I don't get her,

375
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,060
I won't believe it.

376
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Here.

377
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
Here.

378
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
I'll kill you if you don't take it.

379
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Chief.

380
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Let me down.

381
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
You can die if you don't pretend to be dead.

382
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
Let me down.

383
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
I didn't ask you to hit me with a peony.

384
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
You brought me good food again.

385
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
I didn't bring it for you.

386
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
My mom made it for me.

387
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
Hello?

388
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Hello, Chi Cheng.

389
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,060
Are you tired from playing basketball?

390
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,060
I'll be back soon.

391
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,060
I'll be back soon.

392
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
My head.

393
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Hello?

394
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
My head hurts.

395
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
I'll go to the hospital

396
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
to get the medicine.

397
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Okay?

398
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Chi Cheng.

399
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,060
Hello?

400
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,060
Chi Cheng.

401
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,060
My head seems to be more dizzy.

402
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
I'm so dizzy.

403
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
It's so strange.

404
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
What's going on?

405
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,060
I'm so dizzy.

406
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
I'm so dizzy.

407
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
What's wrong?

408
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
I'm so dizzy.

409
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
I'm so dizzy.

410
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
I'm so dizzy.

411
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,060
I'm so dizzy.

412
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
I'm so dizzy.

413
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
I'm so dizzy.

414
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
It suddenly doesn't hurt.

415
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Don't go.

416
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,060
I don't know why I got it.

417
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
This pair of pants is worth 60,000 yuan.

418
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,460
I've seen bad guys.

419
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,740
But I've never seen you so bad.

420
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,940
Let's go together.

421
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,180
Don't hang out.

422
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,340
I'm hungry.

423
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,780
My girlfriend wants...

424
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,580
I'll treat you.

425
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,140
What?

426
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,300
Listen.

427
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,020
This restaurant is so delicious.

428
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,860
Here it is.

429
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,140
Here it is.

430
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,140
Thank you.

431
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,780
You're welcome.

432
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,260
Is this your girlfriend?

433
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,300
Yes.

434
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
My girlfriend, Ding Ding.

435
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,900
Girlfriend?

436
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,740
Enjoy.

437
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,020
I'm your girlfriend?

438
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,180
No.

439
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,460
No.

440
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
I want to drink coke.

441
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,540
Pour it yourself.

442
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,180
There's ice.

443
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,940
Why drink it?

444
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,860
Pour it yourself.

445
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,820
You're so stubborn.

446
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,780
Fill it up.

447
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,980
Fill it up.

448
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,500
I don't eat chili.

449
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,900
It's delicious after you put it in.

450
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,980
Really. Trust me.

451
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,980
Try it.

452
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,900
Mix it first.

453
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,300
It's delicious.

454
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,100
It's delicious.

455
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,980
It's delicious.

456
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
It's delicious.

457
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
It's delicious.

458
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,820
It's delicious.

459
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,660
It's delicious.

460
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,020
It's not about whether to pull it or not.

461
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,700
I just don't like your poor taste.

462
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,740
My friends are all wearing designer bags

463
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
and eating a big meal.

464
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,900
But I'm with you.

465
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,340
Every day, except for noodles, it's spicy soup.

466
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,900
Have you ever treated me to a good meal?

467
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,380
It's delicious.

468
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,260
You ate the ice?

469
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,620
Why don't you eat?

470
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,740
It's too hot.

471
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,100
I have to take a break.

472
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,020
temple

473
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,260
Put it down.

474
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,100
It's too hot.

475
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,780
I told you to put it down,

476
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,420
but you can't hear me.

477
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,220
It's hot.

478
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,740
You're hot?

479
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,500
I tell you.

480
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,100
Come on.

481
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,100
What are you doing?

482
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,260
You like to show off?

483
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,820
Let go.

484
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
You want to cry?

485
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,220
You want to seduce me?

486
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,060
Don't touch me.

487
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
How many do I weigh?

488
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,500
I weigh tens of thousands of pounds.

489
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,820
Tens of thousands?

490
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,140
If you don't cut your pants and sell them,

491
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,180
I'll have a good meal.

492
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,900
You think I'm poor.

493
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,380
You think I'm stingy.

494
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,340
If I really think you're poor,

495
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,180
I'll let your two evil gods

496
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
trick me.

497
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,860
No.

498
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,620
You've been calling me over and over again.

499
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,380
If I do, I'll be fat.

500
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,420
What do you want?

501
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,940
The timing is just right.

502
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,300
You're not my boyfriend.

503
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,020
Why should I let you touch me?

504
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,420
Now,

505
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,220
it's time to break up with Yueyue.

506
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,340
What should we do?

507
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,740
Let's go to my house tonight.

508
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,420
If you don't break up with her,

509
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,020
I won't go.

510
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,100
I won't go.

511
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,540
The last one,

512
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,700
go.

513
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,900
You're extremely impudent.

514
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,940
You're watching me really gracilily.

515
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,260
And you claim that Yueyue is blind.

516
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,620
You're still being shielded?

517
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,060
Why did you shield me too?

518
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,940
Can you see her WeChat Moments?

519
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,660
I just posted one a few days ago.

520
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,500
I asked the Mu Si I sent last time where she bought it.

521
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,660
Wan Quan, who can tell me which store this Mu Si is from?

522
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,900
You don't say to comment on her.

523
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,060
Oh, right.

524
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,700
The Wu Suowei you asked me to investigate last time.

525
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,460
I got the result.

526
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,260
He's actually a straight man.

527
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,700
He just broke up with his girlfriend who he's been dating for three years.

528
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,180
I knew it.

529
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,500
What's more,

530
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,780
his ex-girlfriend is Yueyue.

531
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,660
What did you say?

532
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,820
That's the ex-girlfriend of Wu Suowei.

533
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,820
The current girlfriend of the Poet.

534
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,260
That means

535
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,940
Wu Suowei is stealing a man from his ex-girlfriend.

536
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,700
Maybe.

537
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,420
Is it because he thinks it's great to see his ex-girlfriend?

538
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,100
He wants to find out the truth.

539
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,780
If that's the case, it's good.

540
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,420
I'm afraid he has other dreams.

541
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,620
You're so honest.

542
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,860
I didn't expect you to be counted again.

543
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,420
Why don't you tell him yourself?

544
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,100
How about it?

545
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,260
Don't tell him yet.

546
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,540
Listen,

547
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,100
the best way to do it is to wait for him to fall for it.

548
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,620
Then you can tell him.

549
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,420
That's the fun.

550
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
It's cute.

551
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,420
The circle of friends is deleted again.

552
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,140
If you're right in the time of your investigation,

553
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,340
is Wu Suowei's time with Jiang Xiaoshuai

554
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,700
stuck after Wu Suowei broke up?

555
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,900
It's connected.

556
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,460
So they're in a group

557
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,540
to revenge for their ex-girlfriends.

558
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,300
Ex-girlfriends?

559
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,420
I went to the clinic last time.

560
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,380
I heard Jiang Xiaoshuai was trying to avoid the ex-girlfriends' emotional injury.

561
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,820
Then he was moved here by Jing Linxiang to open a clinic.

562
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,740
Emotional injury.

563
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,460
And sold seal to me as a peque bun.

564
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,460
Long всеume.

565
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,820
This thing

566
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,180
is really getting more interesting.

567
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,140
Why you still romance me over and over again

568
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,140
but you can't let me touch you?

569
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,180
You're not my boyfriend.

570
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,900
Why do I let you touch me?

571
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,140
You're a pervert.

572
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
Are you asleep?

573
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,540
I'm about to sleep. What about you?

574
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,540
I'm about to fall in love.

575
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
You're about to fall in love.

576
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
No, bro.

577
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,540
Why are you sending me messages when you're about to fall in love?

578
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,500
I want you to cheer me up.

579
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,540
Okay, no problem.

580
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,820
Listen up, beautiful girl.

581
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,860
Your boyfriend is not a good bird.

582
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,980
He has to hide from girls,

583
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,660
and even eat the ginseng and lily.

584
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,740
You're so annoying.

585
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,740
Did you eat, Jiang Yisheng?

586
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,980
Jiang Yisheng, you're off duty.

587
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Jiang Yisheng, you're off duty.

588
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,140
Jiang Yisheng, you're off duty.

589
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
No.

590
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,540
It's too hard to send these messages.

591
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,540
I have to think of something interesting.

592
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
Wait a minute.

593
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,540
You don't have to be so curious.

594
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,940
I'll withdraw my money.

595
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Chi Cheng.

596
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,340
You're out.

597
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,140
Are you tired from work?

598
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
I'm tired.

599
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
Are you hungry?

600
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
Let's go eat.

601
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,540
It's a good thing.

602
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
I'll go get something.

603
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,540
I'll go with you.

604
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,540
It seems that I have to put some strong material.

605
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,940
You're quite determined.

606
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,540
You're still not going to live?

607
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
What's wrong with you?

608
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,540
You're smoking.

609
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,540
It's okay.

610
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
I'm fine.

611
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
I'm fine.

612
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
I'm fine.

613
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
I'm fine.

614
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,540
I'm fine.

615
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I'm fine.

616
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
I'm fine.

617
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
I'm fine.

618
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,540
I'm fine.

619
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
I'm fine.

620
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
Look at the car.

621
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,540
I'm planning to sell the snake recently.

622
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,540
I bought a second-hand car.

623
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
When did you buy this car?

624
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
How much is it?

625
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
I bought it last year.

626
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
It's not expensive.

627
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
Is it 50,000 yuan?

628
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,540
I'll sell it with you.

629
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Let me try it.

630
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
You've done it before.

631
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
What are you pretending?

632
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Get in the car.

633
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,540
How is it?

634
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
The car is not bad.

635
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
I'll take you home.

636
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
No need.

637
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
I'll just take a taxi.

638
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
Bye.

639
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
Give me the book.

640
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,540
I happen to be sending my girlfriend off.

641
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,540
Bye.

642
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,540
You're cruel.

643
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
I'll go with you.

644
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,540
I'll go with you.

645
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
I'll go with you.

646
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,540
I'll go with you.

647
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
I'll go with you.

648
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
I'll go with you.

649
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
I'll go with you.

650
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
I'm fine.

651
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
I'm a little thirsty.

652
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
Do you have water at home?

653
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,540
Enough.

654
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,540
Let go of the car.

655
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
No.

656
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,540
Let go.

657
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
It hurts.

658
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
Let go.

659
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,540
Don't you want water?

660
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,540
Let go.

661
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
It hurts.

662
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
What are you doing?

663
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,540
Don't let me take her call.

664
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
No need to use my phone.

665
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,540
You are worried about your phone.

666
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,540
You're worried about your phone.

667
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
I'll call you later.

668
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,540
I'm sorry.

669
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,540
I'm sorry.

671
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,540
I'm sorry.

672
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,540
I'm sorry.

673
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
I'm sorry.

674
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
I'm sorry.

675
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,540
I'm sorry.

676
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,540
I'm sorry.

677
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
I'm sorry.

678
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,540
You're really a little stubborn.

679
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,540
Take a step.

680
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,540
No, no.

681
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,540
Your butt is going to jump into the sky.

682
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
It's quite a surprise.

683
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,540
Why withdraw?

684
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,540
Why?

685
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
Why?

686
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,540
Why?

687
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,540
Why?

688
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,540
Why?

689
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Why?

690
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,540
You're not drunk.

691
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,540
Good.

692
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,540
It was deliberately seducing me to return her.

693
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,540
Don't get into a fight.

694
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,540
I'm sorry.

695
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,540
I'm sorry.

696
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,540
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,540
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,540
I'm sorry.

699
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,540
I'm sorry.

700
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,540
I'm sorry.

701
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,540
I'm sorry.

702
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,540
I'm sorry.

703
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,540
I'm sorry.

704
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,540
I'm sorry.

705
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,540
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,540
I'm sorry.

707
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
I'm sorry.

708
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,540
I'm sorry.

709
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
I'm sorry.

710
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,540
I'm sorry.

711
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,540
I'm sorry.

712
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,540
I'm sorry.

713
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,540
I'm sorry.

714
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,540
I'm sorry.

715
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,540
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,540
I'm sorry.

717
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,540
I'm sorry.

718
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
I'm sorry.

719
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,540
I'm sorry.

720
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,540
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,540
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,540
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,540
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,540
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,540
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,540
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,540
I'm sorry.

730
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
I'm sorry.

731
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,540
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,540
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,540
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,540
I'm sorry.

735
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,540
I'm sorry.

737
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,540
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,540
I'm sorry.

739
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,540
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,540
I'm sorry.

741
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,540

I'm sorry.

755
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,540
I'm sorry.

756
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,540
I'm sorry.

757
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,540
