1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Don't be convicted of it.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,480
Let's quit.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,400
Don't blame yourself.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,600
You won't solve this problem no matter what.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,960
How about I explain to Tan Donglin all of it?

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,400
We've been in bed for so long.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,760
He might know it.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,520
As him.

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,400
He never knew this is not the case.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,040
Sure.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,840
So do you have a boyfriend?

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,600
Who does he think he is?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
What about them?

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,520
Are they waiting for an answer?

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
When the breeze blows through my face,

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,680
it blows through my hair.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,720
They're quietly telling me some words.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,120
The sound of spring is like the sound of flowers.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,640
Is it all you?

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Is it all you?

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,640
The autumn leaves are in the winter, the four seasons are changing.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Is it all you?

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Is it all you?

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Episode 15

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Dr. Jiang.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Aunt Meili.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
I've sent you spring lotus.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Thank you, Aunt Meili.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Happy New Year.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Happy New Year.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Dr. Jiang, why don't you go home during the New Year?

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,640
I'm afraid it's not convenient for everyone to see the doctor during the New Year.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
So I stayed here and let Fatty go home first.

34
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Dr. Jiang, you're really a Bodhisattva.

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Today is the New Year's Eve.

36
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
You have to eat dumplings, right?

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Yes, I do.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Don't worry, Aunt.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Okay, I'll go first.

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Bye.

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Bye, Aunt Meili.

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Happy New Year.

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Happy New Year.

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Mom, I've picked it up.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
Okay.

46
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
When did you buy this dress?

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Look at you.

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
Your memory is not as good as mine now.

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Didn't you buy this for me last month?

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Last month?

51
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Then who sent it to you?

52
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Xiao Chi.

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
He?

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
Hello.

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Hello.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Hello.

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Hello.

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Hello.

59
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Hello.

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Try it on.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
When did you buy it?

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
When I bought clothes for my mom today.

63
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,640
I bought one for you by the way.

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
That day, Xiao Chi brought the doctor here.

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,640
He said he would let the doctor come to our house regularly and check my health.

66
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,640
So that I won't have to run to the hospital.

67
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Xiao Chi really knows how to treat people.

68
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Da Xiong.

69
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Have you seen his parents?

70
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
I...

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
I'm asking you.

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
No need.

73
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
What do you mean no need?

74
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Why are you so rude?

75
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
He treats us so well.

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Why don't you go to see his parents?

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
I will.

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
I will.

79
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
They are busy now.

80
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
I will go when they are free.

81
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
You must go.

82
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
You must be polite.

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Okay.

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
It's so rare.

85
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,640
We must eat and drink together.

86
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Don't be shy.

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Eat more.

88
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
It's so delicious.

89
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Eat more.

90
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Come on, Zhizi.

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Let me give you a toast.

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Uncle.

93
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Let me give you a toast.

94
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
You are not young anymore.

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,640
I don't know when I can drink your wedding wine.

96
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
What are you talking about?

97
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Chi Cheng is the most feminine.

98
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
So many girls are in a hurry.

99
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
They should pick the best one.

100
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Am I right?

101
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Yes.

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Look at my bad mouth.

103
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Chi Cheng.

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Your cousin bought a new house.

105
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
She is going to renovate it.

106
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I heard that your friend has a company

107
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
that is in the art department.

108
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,640
I will ask you to add more decorations.

109
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Okay.

110
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
You can talk to him.

111
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
It's not about the price.

112
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
The company has his investment.

113
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Take it for free.

114
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
He is so generous.

115
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Come on.

116
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Come on.

117
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Let me give you a toast.

118
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Come on.

119
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
On behalf of our family,

120
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,640
I wish you all a healthy and safe new year.

121
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Come on.

122
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Cheers.

123
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Cheers.

124
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Cheers.

125
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
You are so beautiful.

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Cheers.

127
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Cheers.

128
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Cheers.

129
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Cheers.

130
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Cheers.

131
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Cheers.

132
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Oh my god.

133
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
I can't finish it in one minute.

134
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
How is it going, Daqiu?

135
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
How is it going?

136
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
It's changing.

137
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,640
He told me a word.

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Aunt.

139
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Happy new year.

140
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
We were talking about you just now.

141
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
And you came.

142
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Daqiu.

143
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Come on.

144
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
You look so handsome today.

145
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Daqiu, Chi is here.

146
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
You guys talk.

147
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
We are going to eat dumplings.

148
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Why do you come to my house on the new year?

149
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Can you come?

150
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Sit.

151
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Here.

152
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Dumplings are here.

153
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Let's eat.

154
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Let's eat.

155
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Come on.

156
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Chi.

157
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Thank you, aunt.

158
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
You don't go home for New Year's Eve dinner.

159
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Your family doesn't have any opinions?

160
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
They are so many.

161
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
I have a lot of people.

162
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Then you should come to my house often.

163
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Daqiu always praises you.

164
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
He said you are so nice to him.

165
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
We are nice.

166
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Come on.

167
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Drink.

168
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Mom.

169
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Don't pour it.

170
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
He will drive later.

171
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
It's the price.

172
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
He rarely comes to my house.

173
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
It's the New Year.

174
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Why don't you drink?

175
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
If you can't,

176
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
you can stay at my house tonight.

177
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
The bed in Daqiu's room is so big.

178
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
You two can't get out.

179
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Thank you, aunt.

180
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
Be careful.

181
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
You can drink after dinner.

182
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Come on.

183
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
I will make you feel better.

184
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Take it.

185
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Come on.

186
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Throw it.

187
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
So exciting.

188
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Come on.

189
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
You can make a wish.

190
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Me?

191
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
I won't.

192
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
It's like a thunder.

193
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
It will strike.

194
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
The fireworks you play are for girls.

195
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
It's so wild.

196
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
You do it.

197
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I will make a wish.

198
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Here you are.

199
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
What?

200
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
No.

201
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Don't move.

202
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
No.

203
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Don't.

204
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Eat it.

205
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Throw it.

206
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
OK.

207
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
One, two, three.

208
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Go.

209
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
So exciting.

210
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Go.

211
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Who is it?

212
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Delivery.

213
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
I didn't order delivery.

214
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
How is it?

215
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Did you get the key?

216
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Yes.

217
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
It's here.

218
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Wait.

219
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Wait.

220
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Wait.

221
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Wait.

222
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Wait.

223
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Wait.

224
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Wait.

225
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
How is it?

226
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Surprise?

227
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Surprised?

228
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Why are you here?

229
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I'm here to make a warm-up.

230
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Otherwise, you will be lonely at home.

231
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Right?

232
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Now I'm here.

233
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Are you happy to see me?

234
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Uncle.

235
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Come in and say hello.

236
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
OK, Xiao Ji.

237
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
Let me show you.

238
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Come on.

239
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Try it.

240
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
This is what you eat today.

241
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
You are awesome.

242
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Am I great?

243
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,340
The

244
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
Wait.

245
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Your keyboard is so boring.

246
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
The negotiation is not good.

247
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Jinzhou is so poor.

248
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
You two are making trouble.

249
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Give me the keyboard.

250
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Why do you hit the keyboard?

251
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Three thieves hit the keyboard.

252
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Why do you have to do this?

253
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
You have been thinking about your phone

254
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
since you cooked.

255
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
Why don't you go back to your work?

256
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
I said, Xiao Ji.

257
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Stop.

258
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
OK.

259
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
I'm leaving.

260
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Go.

261
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Don't send me off.

262
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm leaving.

263
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
About Lu Zu,

264
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
he is here to talk about the elephant.

265
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
I'm really not sending you off.

266
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
Right?

267
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
The negotiation is more serious.

268
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Keep a distance.

269
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Keep a close eye on him.

270
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
OK, I'm warning you.

271
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
You go down.

272
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
I'll act.

273
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,360
Nuo Long.

274
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,640
Neither Sun or Zhu

275
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,080
can persuade Wu Yue andodigh К

276
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:57,160
to cause the

277
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,520
Three, two, one.

278
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,000
Surprise!

279
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,360
How is it?

280
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,680
Surprise, right?

281
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,880
Actually, I didn't leave at all.

282
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,200
You're an adult.

283
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,680
You're doing this?

284
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Isn't this a way

285
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,760
to coax kids?

286
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,760
Come on.

287
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,960
Hurry.

288
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,280
Make a wish.

289
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,840
Hurry.

290
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,720
Wish us all the best.

291
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,000
We?

292
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,320
Can you find the point?

293
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,520
Then tell me.

294
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,560
What's the point?

295
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,160
Of course, it's to make a wish.

296
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,960
Make a wish?

297
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
Then eat more.

298
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,360
Gao Congxi.

299
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,960
Go on then.

300
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,920
Go.

301
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,240
I...

302
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,020
Go.

303
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,420
Wrong!

304
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,280
is bitch!

305
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,440
A patch...

306
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,420
What did she screw up or New Year's Day with her?

307
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,160
Every year

308
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,580
she gets better.

309
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,020
I'm a teacher.

310
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,220
I'm taught by a famous male student.

311
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,620
I've found out that Xia Mo is dead.

312
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,900
I tricked them into the office.

313
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,140
I'm tired.

314
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,580
I'm so angry.

315
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,300
I'm tired of playing, so I drugged them.

316
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,100
I'll make them rot.

317
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,060
If I drop them, I'll kill them.

318
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,820
I'm not a human.

319
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
I'm a garbage.

320
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,420
I'm a bad person.

321
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,540
I deserve to go to hell.

322
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,740
I deserve to go to hell.

323
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,020
I deserve to go to hell.

324
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,580
I deserve to go to hell.

325
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,420
I deserve to go to hell.

326
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,460
I deserve to go to hell.

327
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,340
Let's go, handsome.

328
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,100
Let's go back to eat.

329
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,500
I deserve to go to hell.

330
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,780
I'm sorry.

331
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,460
Damn it. He's not...

332
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,180
I'm not a human.

333
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,940
I'll apologize later.

334
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,860
Don't apologize yet.

335
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,180
Please don't apologize.

336
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
That's him.

337
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,220
That's him.

338
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,820
That's my little brother.

339
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,940
Go back,

340
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,940
and come to me again.

341
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,940
Go on.

342
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,980
See you next time.

343
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,860
Let's go.

344
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,020
Y debates.

345
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,060
See you.

346
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,580
Bye.

347
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,540
I'm on the flat.

348
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,660
Be careful and cautious at school.

349
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,020
Why can't you remember?

350
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,780
I don't think there's anyone here.

351
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,060
So...

352
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,980
Jiang Xiaoshuai.

353
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,820
I remember when I first met you,

354
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,300
you weren't a careless and ungrateful person.

355
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,940
Why are you like this now?

356
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,540
Meng Tao.

357
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,020
I didn't mean to do that.

358
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,100
I'm sorry.

359
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,340
Jiang Xiaoshuai.

360
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:52,900
Listen,

361
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,980
I have a very important week.

362
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,140
Let's not meet each other, okay?

363
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,340
Meng Tao.

364
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,660
I'm sorry, Meng Tao.

365
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,340
Xiaoshuai.

366
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,980
What's wrong?

367
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,540
You're looking for Jiang Xiaoshuai?

368
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,940
Jiang Xiaoshuai, right?

369
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,580
Yes.

370
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,140
Stop drinking.

371
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,340
No.

372
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,180
You should drink happily when you're out.

373
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,900
Yes.

374
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,900
Drink mine.

375
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,060
Yes.

376
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,620
Drink it.

377
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,220
Perfect match.

378
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,300
You drank too much?

379
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,140
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:57,980
Tell me.

381
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,420
How do you explain it?

382
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,820
I really don't remember.

383
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,500
After our quarrel that day,

384
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,740
I was in a bad mood.

385
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,940
I went to drink with my friends.

386
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,900
Then some friends came.

387
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,420
I was drunk at that time.

388
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,140
Keep changing.

389
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,540
Keep changing.

390
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,180
Meng Tao.

391
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,140
I've been waiting for so long.

392
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,020
Please believe me.

393
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,260
I didn't betray you.

394
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,220
Don't touch me.

395
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,300
You're dirty.

396
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,100
Do you know that?

397
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,980
Jiang Xiaoshuai.

398
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,140
Disappear from my world.

399
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,140
At that time,

400
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,900
I really felt that I was dirty.

401
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,940
I didn't deserve him.

402
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,140
Save him.

403
00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:10,520
Jiang Xiaoshuai is a

404
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
He later

405
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,680
Married another woman.

406
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,520
I remember

407
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
I adjusted the phone to mute.

408
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,480
But I don't know why

409
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
The phone ring still rings.

410
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,720
I never knew the phone ring

411
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,120
Can ring for so long.

412
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,720
As if I must

413
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,320
Pick up your phone.

414
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,640
to,

415
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,840
empress to.

416
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,020
If nobody can talk open this

417
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,980
Especially drafting

418
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,960
What could you do?

419
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,040
I'm stillbor sustrac 1980

420
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,400
Open the door.

421
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,680
Open the door.

422
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,240
Open the door.

423
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,720
Open the door.

424
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,920
Open the door.

425
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,400
Open the door.

426
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,720
What if something happens to Linlin?

427
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
Dr. Jiang, please!

428
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
I hated him.

429
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,760
I hated him for spreading my photo.

430
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,080
I hated him for making me want to die.

431
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,240
But I never thought

432
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,960
he was so cruel.

433
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,360
Why didn't you tell me

434
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
such an important thing?

435
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
If you had told me earlier,

436
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,640
I would have taken it from him.

437
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,120
It's not enough to kill a man like him.

438
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,840
Sorry, I'm not on duty today.

439
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,400
It's okay, Young Master.

440
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,720
He's a good man.

441
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,680
Look at him now.

442
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
He's going to get his revenge.

443
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
Meng Tao!

444
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,200
How dare you come here?

445
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,200
Young Master, I'm sorry.

446
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,920
I was wrong.

447
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,320
Young Master.

448
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,360
I was wrong.

449
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,880
Let me go.

450
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,320
Young Master, I was wrong.

451
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,960
Let me go.

452
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,000
I was wrong.

453
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
I was wrong.

454
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,840
I should have died.

455
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm sorry, Young Master.

456
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
I shouldn't have

457
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,480
dumped you for Qu Lingdao's daughter.

458
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,960
I shouldn't have used such a despicable way

459
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
to dump you.

460
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,560
I was wrong.

461
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
I admit it.

462
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,400
I admit it.

463
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,800
I designed everything

464
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,160
in the first place.

465
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,960
Those men...

466
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,840
I spent money on them.

467
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,760
You actually

468
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,160
had nothing to do with them.

469
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,840
Xiao Shuai.

470
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,520
I knew it.

471
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,160
You scum.

472
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,320
Xiao Shuai.

473
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,320
Xiao Shuai.

474
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,720
Didn't you want to know the truth?

475
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,000
This is the whole truth.

476
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,640
I told you everything.

477
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,000
I've shot the video.

478
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I've apologized.

479
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,720
I swear.

480
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,440
I promise

481
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,920
I won't do this again.

482
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,880
I swear I won't do this again.

483
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,920
Xiao Shuai.

484
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,400
You...

485
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,840
Xiao Shuai.

486
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,640
Can you

487
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,600
let your friend let me go?

488
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,480
Okay?

489
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,400
Let him say good words.

490
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,880
Let me go, okay?

491
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,080
Let me go.

492
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,040
Xiao Shuai.

493
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,840
I'm not a human.

494
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,160
I'm not a human.

495
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm not a human.

496
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,480
I'm not a human.

497
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,520
Xiao Shuai.

498
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,120
Let your friend let me go.

499
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,560
What are you talking about?

500
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,440
What friend?

501
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Don't touch me.

502
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,320
It's your friend named Guo.

503
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,080
He said...

504
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,560
He said only if you forgive me

505
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
can he let me go.

506
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm a scum.

507
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,160
Xiao Shuai.

508
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,200
How about this?

509
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,040
For...

510
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,520
For the sake of our good company,

511
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,760
let him let me go, okay?

512
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,800
Let him let me go.

513
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,440
Xiao Shuai.

514
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,000
I beg you.

515
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,840
Good company.

516
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,640
Don't touch me.

517
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,800
Are you still a human?

518
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,240
You're a scum.

519
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,640
When you slandered me,

520
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,560
did you think about today?

521
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,040
When you hurt others,

522
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,760
did you think about today?

523
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,720
Everyone has to pay for

524
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,560
what they've done.

525
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,960
You can apologize,

526
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,000
but I have an unacceptable reason.

527
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,560
Yes.

528
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,160
Xiao Shuai.

529
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,880
It's my fault.

530
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm not a human.

531
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,400
I'm a scum.

532
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,880
I'm not a human.

533
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,400
I'm a scum.

534
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,800
Let me go.

535
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,560
Yin Zi.

536
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,040
Get out.

537
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,720
I told you to get out.

538
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,240
Didn't you hear me?

539
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,000
Go.

540
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,320
Xiao Shuai.

541
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,960
I'm sorry.

542
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Guo.

543
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,120
I've apologized.

544
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,000
Let me go.

545
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
Let me go.

546
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,360
I've apologized.

547
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,040
You went on a business trip

548
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
because you were busy?

549
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,360
Thank you.

550
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,800
It's okay.

551
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,080
What did you say?

552
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,920
Thank you.

553
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,680
You can speak human words.

554
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,360
Say it again.

555
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,000
Let me hear it.

556
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,600
Say it again.

557
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,840
You hit me

558
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,400
with this punch.

559
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Luckily, I'm fit.

560
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,800
When did you

561
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
know about it?

562
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,720
Well,

563
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,960
since

564
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,840
I've been following you.

565
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Stop pretending to be innocent.

566
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,920
You're not fit for me.

567
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,320
At first,

568
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
I thought you were interesting.

569
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,280
So I wanted to tease you.

570
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,480
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

571
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,880
I remember you.

572
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,280
Okay.

573
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,040
Okay.

574
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,720
Aunt,

575
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,320
have this.

576
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,360
Dr. Xiao Shuai.

577
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,240
Let me see

578
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,080
why there's no sound on this phone.

579
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,520
You click here.

580
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,880
Thank you, Dr. Xiao Shuai.

581
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,760
Then,

582
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
I found you're a warm and kind person.

583
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,600
I want to report to Senior

584
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,640
the fact present in this year for proof.

585
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:37,280
Even though there was talk of

586
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,840
keepingthinker's record,

587
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,260
Your Honor master

588
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,360
acted hastily.

589
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,520
Don't forget to kill yourself.

590
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Your Honor,

591
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,520
it took me a day

592
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,640
to Sophitate you.

593
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,480
I'm sorry.

594
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,640
It's not my fault.

595
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,840
Apologize.

596
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,440
Let him apologize to me.

597
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Let him apologize to me.

598
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,120
Shui Peng, don't worry.

599
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,840
He owes you.

600
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,600
I will

601
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,760
make him pay back one by one.

602
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,040
Are you a man or not?

603
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,840
Did I do anything wrong?

604
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,240
I'm sorry.

605
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,240
Enough.

606
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,480
Don't beat him to death.

607
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,320
Pull him over.

608
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,120
Get up.

609
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,840
Do you know why I beat you?

610
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,080
Say something.

611
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,480
I know.

612
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,440
I know.

613
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,000
This thing has been delayed for so long.

614
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,160
It's time to make a conclusion.

615
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,360
Mr. Gu.

616
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,240
Brother Gu.

617
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,080
Uncle Gu.

618
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,920
I know I was wrong.

619
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,200
Please let me go.

620
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,600
I will be a good man in the future.

621
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,760
I won't do it again.

622
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,440
I've already been repaid.

623
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm begging you.

624
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,000
Repay?

625
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,680
I...

626
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,840
When this video is recorded,

627
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,840
remember to find Jiang Xiaoshuai

628
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,160
and tell him everything

629
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,720
you did that year.

630
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,200
Mr. Gu.

631
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,840
You...

632
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,800
You don't have the right to make a conclusion.

633
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,680
Do as I say.

634
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,720
Otherwise,

635
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,400
I'm your Lord Yan.

636
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,440
Say it.

637
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Raise your head.

638
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,240
The rumors in the school

639
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,080
are all true.

640
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,560
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

641
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,440
For many years,

642
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,320
I've been wearing the teacher's clothes

643
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,680
and taught by many male students.

644
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
It's too late to report him.

645
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,920
I've found the project's name

646
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,280
and put them in the office.

647
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,040
Make a wish.

648
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,480
Wish us all the best.

649
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,080
You're so good.

650
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,760
I must make you a wish!

651
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,280
You must be tired from the Feed-TH jewels.

652
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,640
Let's go for breakfast.

653
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,160
As for the dishes on the lunar eve,

654
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,240
just listen,

655
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,960
usually moon-belly restaurants

656
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,960
take care of their own eat belts.

657
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,280
But this restaurant

658
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,360
бо Quite famous for making fried dishes.

659
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,960
Behavior.

660
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,040
A great way to take a taste of food.

661
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,440
Especially with a grilled musiang

662
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,800
near his house

663
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
It's so fresh.

664
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
It melts in your mouth.

665
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
It's so fresh.

666
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,800
I wish you could swallow it.

667
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
Let's go, Young Master.

668
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
I promise you to eat...

669
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,400
Young Master.

670
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,120
What's wrong?

671
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,360
Wait a minute.

672
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,000
Uncle Wang.

673
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
What's wrong?

674
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,480
Chen Yu.

675
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,400
How do you know to come back?

676
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,960
You recognized me at a glance.

677
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,520
Good for you.

678
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
All these years,

679
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,240
you've always been like this.

680
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,400
Walking is like walking without a foot.

681
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
You've been raised a lot.

682
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Of course, at a glance,

683
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
you can distinguish yourself from a normal person.

684
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,600
Chen Yu.

685
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,760
Who is he?

686
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,400
Hello.

687
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm Wang Shuang.

688
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,240
Wang Shuang.

689
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm Jiang Xiao Shuai.

690
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Jiang Xiao Shuai is not bad.

691
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
He left in advance...

692
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
when he knew that I had something to say to you.

693
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
I like him.

694
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
My people don't need you to like them.

695
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Your people?

696
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
You're so mischievous.

697
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,040
I was half your man back then.

698
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,160
I've never seen you protect me like this.

699
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
I'm not.

700
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm not.

701
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I'm not.

702
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
I'm not.

703
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
I'm not.

704
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,360
I've realized that after all these years,

705
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,360
your bad habits haven't changed at all.

706
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,280
You've been back for half a year.

707
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,640
I've been here for a long time.

708
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,320
What do you mean?

709
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,240
I have a home here. I can't come back.

710
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,560
You've been on the horse for six years.

711
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,280
You let others take care of you.

712
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,920
If you don't come back,

713
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,080
let others take you away.

714
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,920
It's too late to chase after you.

715
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,800
If I chase after them a few months ago,

716
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,120
it's about the rope.

717
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
If I chase after them now,

718
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,360
even if I steal the rope,

719
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,160
the horse won't leave with me.

720
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,360
Don't you like adventure games?

721
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,400
I'll leave in a few days.

722
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,000
Don't you want to see me?

723
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,400
I don't care if I see you or not.

724
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
You won't leave.

725
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
How do you know?

726
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I just know.

727
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Guo Zhengyi,

728
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
you're so smart that people don't like you.

729
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,880
Don't you want me to be yours bread?

730
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,120
All right, we'll go together.

731
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,040
But, fighting is playing with wood,

732
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,480
fighting is being nice.

733
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,280
Let's wait for them.

734
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,320
They'll burn.

735
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,120
Let's wait for them.

736
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,840
If we lose them,

737
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,020
510希望

738
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,060
I met her on the way

739
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,560
She sent you carelessly

740
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,280
He said he wanted to call you out to get together.

741
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Why is he back?

742
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
He's probably here to rob people.

743
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
You have to watch out.

744
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
The power of the moon light returning to the country

745
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,840
is not something that ordinary people can handle.

746
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Drink some water.

747
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
You saw it?

748
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,840
What did I see?

749
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
If you want to chase, go ahead.

750
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Or else, you won't get a chance.

751
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
No, you say it.

752
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Who am I chasing?

753
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,840
I remember someone said on someone else's birthday

754
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
don't let me see him again.

755
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,840
If I see him again, I will kill him.

756
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
You're jealous?

757
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
How is that possible?

758
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Yes.

759
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,840
I thought killing him was a good idea.

760
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
But I met you.

761
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Why waste this time?

762
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Stop talking to me about these beautiful things.

763
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
If you have the ability, you can solve it in your heart.

764
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,840
No, you like to torture yourself so much, right?

765
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Do you have to explode your thoughts in your heart to satisfy you?

766
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Yes, I like to see you be a fool.

767
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
That will let you down.

768
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Don't worry.

769
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
I don't have a crazy person in my heart anymore.

770
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Cheers!

771
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Cheers!

772
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Where's the fish?

773
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
I drank it.

774
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
This place hasn't changed at all.

775
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
But you've lost weight.

776
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
What does it have to do with you?

777
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Have you lost weight?

778
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
No, I'm quite strong, right?

779
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,840
But you're so skinny that you look like a package of bones.

780
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
You're in this shape right now.

781
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
It's a game for women.

782
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Women don't like it.

783
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,840
It's no fun being played by men.

784
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
You're so mean.

785
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
I'm skinny but I'm not fat.

786
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
I just have a low body fat.

787
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Didn't you play the game of stop-motion?

788
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
I'd forget if you didn't say it.

789
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I did play the game of stop-motion.

790
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,840
But I only played it once.

791
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
I didn't play it for a long time.

792
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,840
I played it for three years.

793
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
You're so mean.

794
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,840
I don't think I can beat you.

795
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
I just want you to stop playing.

796
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
Okay, I got it.

797
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
I'm here now.

798
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,840
I'm here, too.

799
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Your brother didn't wake up with you?

800
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
He's back.

801
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
He's busy with his own work.

802
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Speaking of your brother,

803
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I remember the time when we went to the university.

804
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
You were bullied by others in school.

805
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
But your brother came to you.

806
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
He beat you up.

807
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,120
No one is bullying you.

808
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,280
Do you know what it is?

809
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,080
What?

810
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,640
It's called Psychic Abuse.

811
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,720
Those people who bully me

812
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,760
even my brother's brother is so rude.

813
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,280
Who dares to bully me?

814
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,520
I'll be in a long way.

815
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,320
Your brother is a talent.

816
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,480
I heard that

817
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,760
the person you're looking for

818
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,560
is a disciple of Yue.

819
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,160
Yes.

820
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,360
Why do you like to do this?

821
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,440
You used to chase twins.

822
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,800
You couldn't tell who was who.

823
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,120
Now you're a disciple.

824
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,240
What?

825
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,040
It shows that you two are close.

826
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,840
We're always close.

827
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,200
Yes.

828
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
But don't smoke.

829
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,240
We're drinking. Don't drink.

830
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,920
I'm leaving.

831
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,080
I'm leaving.

832
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm leaving.

833
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,800
Dandan.

834
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,200
I still want to tell you

835
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,360
that I'm not afraid of the stars or the mountains.

836
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,080
When the sun rises and sets,

837
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,320
I'll wait for you in my eyes,

838
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,800
not afraid of the time.

839
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,560
The last night on earth,

840
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,800
I just want to confess to you.

841
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,480
Spend the last moment with sincerity.

842
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,480
Maybe there will be no regrets.

843
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,640
The last night on earth,

844
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,440
when life becomes a long love,

845
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:53,200
the moment the sea water kisses the sky,

846
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:02,640
I will leave with you without hesitation.
