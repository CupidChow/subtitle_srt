00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,000
Neo

2
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,000
Never Back to the pictures

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,260
Doctor magazine

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,260
The light is shining under the tree

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,260
What about them?

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
Are they waiting for the answer?

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,260
When the breeze blows past my face

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,260
And blows through my hair

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,260
They are telling me a few words

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,260
The spring breeze is blowing

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,260
The words are being spoken

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,260
Are they all about you?

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,260
It's all about you

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,260
The autumn leaves are in the winter

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,260
The four seasons are changing

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,260
It's the same with you

17
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,260
It's the same with you

18
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,260
It's the same with you

19
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,260
Hello?

20
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,260
Chen Shao, I've just got a new lecture

21
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,260
Hurry up

22
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,260
Wait, I'll accompany you

23
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,000
The

24
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Haolong

25
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,260
It's your turn to come out

26
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,260
Mom, let me do it

27
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,260
It's okay, let me do it

28
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
I'm going to see my master today

29
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260
Thank you, mom

30
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
Look, I bought Yueyue

31
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,260
Her favorite crayfish

32
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,260
Mom, this duck doesn't have three jin

33
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,260
How could it be?

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,260
Aunt Liu knows that I'm going to see my son-in-law today

35
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,260
She gave me ten crayfish

36
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,260
Mom, you're so mean

37
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,260
There's no three jin

38
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,260
Half a bag of water

39
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,260
I'll go find her

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,260
Don't go, kid

41
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,260
Aunt Liu is not easy to do business

42
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,260
You can't do business

43
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,260
Mom

44
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
What did mom tell you?

45
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,260
It's a blessing if you suffer

46
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,260
The more you suffer, the more you get

47
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,260
Really?

48
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
Have you been through this for so many years?

49
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
But it's different today

50
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
Yueyue is coming today

51
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Yes

52
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Why hasn't this little girl arrived yet?

53
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
It's okay

54
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
She was always late when she was on a date with me

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
I guess she should be around now

56
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,260
It's not easy to find here

57
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,260
I'm going out to pick her up now

58
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
What a poor place

59
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,260
It's dirty and smelly

60
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Yueyue

61
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
Yueyue

62
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Be careful

63
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,260
Yueyue

64
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
You're here, Yueyue

65
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
We can eat when we get in the house

66
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,260
My mom has made it

67
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,260
And you know what?

68
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
My mom knows you're here

69
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,260
She's waiting for you

70
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,260
I'm going to go to the bathroom

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,260
I'll be back

72
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
I'll be back

73
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,260
I'll be back

74
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,840
OK

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,260
If you're happy today

76
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
Just go

77
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,260
And you know what?

78
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,260
My mom is so happy you're here

79
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
I'm not here for the meal today

80
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,260
I have something to tell you

81
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,260
Yueyue, go ahead

82
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Wu Qิqiao

83
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,260
Let's break up

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,260
Why?

85
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,260
Why let you break up?

86
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
Weren't you happy to have dinner in my house?

87
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,260
Why so suddenly?

88
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,260
Suddenly?

89
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,880
In the past I loved you

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
at least you look handsome

91
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Look at you now

92
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
I can change what you like

93
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
I can change back to Yueyue

94
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
We have been together for so long

95
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
I am sorry

96
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
Wang Zhenglong

97
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,260

You are going to lose today

Zhou Qiang, they are not the best brothers

113

They have been fighting for so many years

114
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
You say Chi Shou's snake can win

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Can Guo Shao's snake win?

116
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
It's not necessary

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
Which time is not Chi Shao's snake

118
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
I heard that black snake

119
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
Guo Shao spent a lot of money to bring it back from South America

120
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260

This is my good buddy Chi Cheng

162
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
You go to accompany him

163
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
I gave you the doll

164
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Have fun

165
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260

Doctor Jiang, I know you like desserts

168
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Meili made you a cake

169
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Thank you, Aunt Meili

170
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,260
You're welcome

171
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Uncle Li

172
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
It's not good for Jingchun

173
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Aunt Meili, you're so beautiful

174
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
No, I'm not

175
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Did the doll you sent me wake up?

176
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
Yes, it's a gift for me

177
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Little Chen

178
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
It's okay

179
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,260
It's okay

180
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
It hurts

181
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,260
Don't move

182
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,260
I just gave you the medicine

183
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Where am I?

184
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
This is the clinic

185
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Your friend sent it to you

186
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Friend

187
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,260
Slow down

188
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
Is it a girl?

189
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
No, it's a girl

190
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
She told me

191
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
I should use the cheapest medicine

192
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
The one that can be used for the money

193
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
She knows me best

194
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
She's my girlfriend

195
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
Girlfriend

196
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,260
Yes, who's the man?

197
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
Maybe he's a friend

198
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
Or maybe

199
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
He's a hot-hearted person

200
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
Hot-hearted person

201
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Brother, you seem to be green

202
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Okay, I admit

203
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Actually, I can't blame him

204
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
It's because I'm ugly

205
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
And fat

206
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,260
I think you're good

207
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Really?

208
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Believe me

209
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
You

210
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
First, shave your beard

211
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Cut a handsome hairstyle

212
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,260
What kind of hairstyle?

213
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
The more handsome the better

214
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,260
Can you cut it?

215
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,260
No problem

216
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,260
Dress up cleanly

217
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
It's the hardest to lose weight

218
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
You must hold on

219
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Make a big change

220
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,260
Your girlfriend will change her mind

221
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
I'm here

222
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
Come, stand up

223
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,260
Thank you

224
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
I'm successful

225
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,260
Hello

226
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
Son, where are you?

227
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Your dad is in the hospital

228
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Come back

229
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
Okay, I got it

230
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
I know

231
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
It's okay

232
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Eat

233
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Watch the fire

234
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,260
What's wrong?

235
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,260
Are you jealous?

236
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Little jealous

237
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Mom

238
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Mom

239
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
Why did you bring this back?

240
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,260
You didn't stay in the hospital with my dad

241
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
There is a caretaker

242
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260
I'll be back to wait for you

243
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,260
Let's go

244
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Where?

245
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Go to the hospital to see my dad

246
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,260
Don't worry

247
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,260
I'll go tomorrow

248
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,260
Your dad is asleep

249
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
I knew it

250
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
I'll go to bed first

251
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,260
I'll go to bed first

252
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,260
You can't stay at home

253
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
You can't stay at home

254
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
I'm here

255
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
Say

256
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Something happened

257
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
Someone took the snake nest

258
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,260
What?

259
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Someone took the snake nest

260
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,260
How can someone take it?

261
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
I don't know

262
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,260
I think I and Da Kun

263
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
Were drugged last night

264
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,260
They slept so deeply

265
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,260
It's past 9 in the morning

266
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,260
Someone took the snake nest

267
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,260
Where is the dragon?

268
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,260
I don't know

269
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
He's gone

270
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
Don't tell me it's useless

271
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,260
You have to find the dragon

272
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,260
You didn't stay in the hospital

273
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,260
You took the snake nest

274
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
You took the snake nest

275
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
I knew it

276
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
I've arranged it

277
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
Next week, go to the department of the group's property

278
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,260
Start from the bottom

279
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
I'll go to the back door

280
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
You go for an hour

281
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,260
Look at you

282
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,260
You're 28

283
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,260
You don't have a decent job

284
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,260
Look at Guo Cheng Yu

285
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
He's running the company well

286
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,260
He likes to play too

287
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
But he didn't delay the serious business

288
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,260
You can let him call you dad

289
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
I don't mind

290
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,260
I want to change a son

291
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,260
He complained

292
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,260
To my office

293
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,260
He said my son was a pervert

294
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,260
He's a mess

295
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,260
How can I let go of my old face?

296
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
If you want your snakes to live well

297
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
You should go to work

298
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Xiao Zhu A36

299
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Xiao Zhu A36, you can eat

300
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,260
Yue Yue, you're here

301
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,260
Look, I'm thinner

302
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,260
Let's go, I'll take you to eat something delicious

303
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Wu Qi Qiong

304
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,260
Can you stop bothering me?

305
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm here to tell you

306
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,260
There's no possibility between us

307
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Don't send me messages

308
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Why, Yue Yue

309
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
You thought I was fat

310
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
You thought I was lazy

311
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
I can change everything

312
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
It's not about being lazy

313
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,260
I just don't like your poor appearance

314
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,260
His old friends

315
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
are the best

316
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,260
But I followed you

317
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
There's nothing but spicy soup

318
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Do you buy me a big meal every day?

319
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,260
Are we here?

320
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
A36, Xiao Zhu A36, are you here?

321
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
The restaurant is famous

322
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
secular

323
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,540
Sunlight

324
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
You can only have supper here

325
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,260
Sorry

326
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,800
Yuan Yuan, Yuan Yuan.

327
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,060
Look, only a hundred bucks爆了

328
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,880
How about switching to others then?

329
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,840
Let's go.

330
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,400
Look at that poorO difficulties.

331
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,240
You might as well be someone totally different.

332
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,640
Wang Zhilong.

333
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,900
I already told you.

334
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,920
What do you have to waste your time with him?

335
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,060
You현

336
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,220
Look what?

337
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,180
Simply ridiculous!

338
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,420
These are all admitions.

339
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,760
You first.

340
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,160
Tong safe pinch out.

341
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I'm not poor.

342
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I'm not poor.

343
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Just because of your name,

344
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
I can't turn over my back.

345
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Let's go.

346
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Hello?

347
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Hello?

348
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Hello, leader?

349
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Okay, okay.

350
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I'll be there soon.

351
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Leader.

352
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
What time is it?

353
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
I usually ask for projects.

354
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I want to get paid.

355
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
The key is that no one is here.

356
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Why are you staring at me?

357
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I asked you to fix this.

358
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Why are you looking at me?

359
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Fix it.

360
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Okay, I'll fix it now.

361
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Okay.

362
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
What are you doing?

363
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Leader,

364
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
this key is broken.

365
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
We need to replace it.

366
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
This is it.

367
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
This key was originally good.

368
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
No.

369
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
It was broken at first.

370
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
I'm not angry.

371
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,160
You are too small.

372
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
You

373
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
pay the commission first.

374
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Next month,

375
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
go to the Ministry of Finance to pay the commission.

376
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
I haven't paid the delivery fee last month.

377
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
I have less than 5,000 yuan in salary this month.

378
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
If you think the company's salary is not good,

379
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
you can quit.

380
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Don't be so shameless.

381
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
You can even make conditions with me.

382
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
What kind of person are you?

383
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm telling you,

384
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,160
if you lose the money today,

385
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
it will be over.

386
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,160
If you think I'm a coward,

387
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
I have a good leader.

388
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Everyone is a coward.

389
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
I quit.

390
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
No.

391
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Wu Ji Qiong,

392
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
it's only been a few days.

393
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Why did you come here again?

394
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
I changed my name.

395
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
What did you change?

396
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
It doesn't matter.

397
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I want your blood.

398
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
What?

399
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I want your blood.

400
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
What blood?

401
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I want your blood.

402
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Welcome.

403
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Thank you, Young Master.

404
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Are you willing to take me in?

405
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
It's okay.

406
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Anyway,

407
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I want to find someone to help me with the shop.

408
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,160
The main thing is that I want to start my own business.

409
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
But I'm afraid my mom will worry about me.

410
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
So it's not convenient to stay at home.

411
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Have you decided what to do?

412
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Yes.

413
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Sell sugar man.

414
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
The night market near Xiong City.

415
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
I heard the supervision there is very strict.

416
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
It's okay.

417
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
I've already guessed it.

418
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Sell sugar man.

419
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Sell fruit.

420
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Here,

421
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
we only manage the gold and oil.

422
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
The management fee

423
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
is temporarily reduced.

424
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
The management fee

425
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
is temporarily reduced.

426
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
The shop is coming.

427
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Hurry up.

428
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Wait for me.

429
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Uncle,

430
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
why are they running away?

431
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
This street is the property of the far-off group.

432
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,160
They are here to sell the stall.

433
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
They are here to sell the stall.

434
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
If they don't have the certificate,

435
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
they will run away when they see someone checking.

436
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Uncle, did you get the certificate?

437
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm a small business.

438
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
I often change places.

439
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
It's not necessary.

440
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
Aren't you afraid of being caught?

441
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Let me tell you.

442
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
That person's nickname is Black.

443
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
He's been following us.

444
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
He's been following us.

445
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
A small manager

446
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
shouldn't bother him.

447
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
That's great.

448
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Newly-made light.

449
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Uncle, what are you yelling about?

450
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
This big beard

451
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
is the most inappropriate thing.

452
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
He has the right to own it.

453
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
He often bullies the owner.

454
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Get out of here.

455
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Look.

456
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
The Blacks are teaching him a lesson.

457
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Go to hell.

458
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Get angry.

459
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
What are you doing?

460
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
What are you doing?

461
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
You...

462
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
You...

463
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
You...

464
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
You...

465
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
You...

466
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Go to hell.

467
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Uncle.

468
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Uncle.

469
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
The man in the suit is more handsome.

470
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Move aside.

471
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Move aside.

472
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
You deserve it.

473
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
Hurry.

474
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Get up.

475
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Uncle.

476
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
When it comes to these

477
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
cheapskates,

478
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
they have to be tough.

479
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Let's see how I deal with them.

480
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Li Wo,

481
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
you found this?

482
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
I don't recognize him.

483
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Chi Sha,

484
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
go after him.

485
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
You bastard.

486
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Don't let me catch you.

487
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
I'll kill you.

488
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
I'll tell you what.

489
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
I'll kill you.

490
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
Just go.

491
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Go.

492
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Go.

493
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,760
Don't let me catch you.

494
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,400
Then let's

495
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,640
meet this God.

496
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,960
What's wrong?

497
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,800
Help him.

498
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,520
Wait.

499
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,280
Someone is coming.

500
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,000
Don't tell him I'm here.

501
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:10,960
Okay.

502
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,960
You hide in there.

503
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,360
Okay.

504
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,040
Don't make any noise.

505
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,560
Okay.

506
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,640
Don't make any noise.

507
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,880
Baby.

508
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,400
Why so violent?

509
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,640
What's up?

510
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,960
Looking for someone.

511
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,920
Who?

512
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,040
If you have a stomachache, go to the hospital for treatment.

513
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Turn left 30 meters and take Line 2.

514
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
You look so pretty.

515
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,920
If you have no eyes, go to the same hospital for treatment.

516
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,560
You like men, right?

517
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,360
If you have a mental illness, go to the hospital for treatment.

518
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,200
Keep engrossed in your own effort.

519
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,960
Girl,

520
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,040
hands down

521
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,160
Jiang Xiaoshuai,

522
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,240
I remember you.

523
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,160
It may not be appropriate to touch that stuff.

524
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,600
Yes.

525
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,880
We can discuss the rest.

526
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,360
Okay.

527
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,200
She's just a few words into my head.

528
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,780
It's notifications,

529
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,160
I just find myself watching the phone in a daze.

530
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,480
Why don't you know to himself

531
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,000
in good physical contact?

532
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,480
Little Handsome Doctor.

533
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,160
Did you ever meet your girlfriend?

534
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
But...

535
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,640
I see a boyfriend.

536
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,160
Sorry to disturb you.

537
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
What's wrong?

538
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Did you drink too much?

539
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
No.

540
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
It's okay.

541
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
I'll leave first.

542
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
When did you take it away?

543
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
When you were talking,

544
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
my second start is about to start.

545
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
I'll come back with a smile.

546
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Where are you going?

547
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Chi,

548
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
how many years of class reunion have you been absent?

549
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
I have a business meeting.

550
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
I can't leave.

551
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
What?

552
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Don't come.

553
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
You,

554
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Guo Chengyu,

555
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
and that Wang Shu of the Love Snake,

556
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
you used to be very...

557
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Now you...

558
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Okay, guys.

559
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
After the case of success of the first two cases,

560
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
we'll go to the third one now.

561
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
I found it, guys.

562
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Let me show you, okay?

563
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Isn't it good?

564
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Okay.

565
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
We'll test them today.

566
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
We've connected the真孔 camera.

567
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
I'll have to record it later.

568
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
The moment we turn off the phone,

569
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
the miracle will come.

570
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I'll go.

571
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I'll go.

572
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
I'll go.

573
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
I'll go.

574
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
I'll go.

575
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Are you okay?

576
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Thank you.

577
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
You're pretending to fall.

578
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,300
You're a

579
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
I'm not a thief.

580
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
I'm a bad video recorder.

581
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
I'll return your phone.

582
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Brother, look.

583
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Do you believe me?

584
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
I'm not a thief.

585
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
What are you doing?

586
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Brother.

587
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
I'm not a thief.

588
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Really.

589
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Let go of it yourself.

590
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
No, brother.

591
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
We've met before.

592
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Brother.

593
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I really have evidence to prove that I'm not a thief.

594
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
Let me show you.

595
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Look.

596
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
I'm a counterfeit.

597
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
You're a passerby I picked randomly.

598
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
This is to tell you the truth about thieves.

599
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
So that you don't meet thieves.

600
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Really, brother.

601
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Do you think the audience can testify for me?

602
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Look.

603
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Look.

604
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Look.

605
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Right?

606
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Right?

607
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
What's your name?

608
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Wu Suowei.

609
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Wu Suowei.

610
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
So cool.

611
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
No, brother.

612
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
I'm a counterfeit.

613
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
I'm a counterfeit too.

614
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Wait a minute.

615
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Who is it?

616
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Look.

617
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
You're really Wu Suowei.

618
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Yes, brother.

619
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
A counterfeit.

620
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Not a personality.

621
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Not a personality.

622
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Why did you use the soup to break me that day?

623
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Brother.

624
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I didn't want to break you that day.

625
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I wanted to break your body.

626
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
I...

627
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
I didn't want to break anyone.

628
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Brother.

629
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
I was wrong, brother.

630
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
I was wrong.

631
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Brother.

632
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Brother.

633
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Don't go, brother.

634
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
I'll give you two choices.

635
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Either you get beaten up like this melon seedling.

636
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Or

637
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
the equipment is unfamiliar.

638
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
I feel beaten up.

639
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
You've made up your mind.

640
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Brother.

641
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Brother.

642
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Give it back to me.

643
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
I bought it with a lot of money.

644
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Give it to me.

645
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Brother.

646
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Chi Chang.

647
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Brother.

648
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Bring him back.

649
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
This guy wants to escape from the country.

650
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Brother.

651
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Brother.

652
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Listen to me.

653
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Your father took dozens of people to the suburbs overnight.

654
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
I was so scared.

655
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Your father interrogated me in person.

656
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Otherwise, I wouldn't have told him.

657
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Who are you lying to?

658
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
You called the chairman's office.

659
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Guo Chengyu was the one who called.

660
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
When the chairman drove to the suburbs,

661
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
you were so unlucky.

662
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Come here.

663
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Brother Chi.

664
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Brother Chi.

665
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
What do you think of him?

666
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Not bad.

667
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
We all like him.

668
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Everyone likes you.

669
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
I don't know.

670
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
I don't know.

671
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Then let's leave it to you.

672
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
I'm leaving.

673
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
Brother Chi.

674
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Brother Chi.

675
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Be good.

676
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Brother Chi.

677
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Be good.

678
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Brother Chi.

679
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Brother Chi.

680
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Go away.

681
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Brother Chi.

682
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Sorry.

683
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Brother Chi.

684
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
I'm leaving.

685
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Brother Chi.

686
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Let me go.

687
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Let me go.

688
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Watch out.

689
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Brother Chi.

690
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Don't kick my son.

691
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
I'm leaving.

692
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Let me go.

693
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Let me go.

694
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Brother Chi.

695
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Let me go.

696
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Whose car is this?

697
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Can you stop?

698
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Do you know?

699
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Damn it.

700
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Damn it.

701
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
How can you stop?

702
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Chi Chi.

703
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Is it your car?

704
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Drive quickly.

705
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
Or I'll smash it.

706
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Why are you still standing there?

707
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
What are you doing?

708
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Get out of here.

709
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Stupid.

710
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Only a man like this deserves it.

711
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Win.

712
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
Don't be reckless.

713
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Drive carefully.

714
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
What's wrong with you today?

715
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Nothing.

716
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,760
Xiao...

717
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,720
Slow down.

718
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,360
Let him pass.

719
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Wang Zhilong.

720
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,360
Wake up.

721
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,000
Wang Zhilong.

722
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,520
Say something.

723
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,640
Okay?

724
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,560
Cheers.

725
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,160
You're acting like someone owes you a debt

726
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,920
I'll give you a year

727
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,960
If you can't find a girlfriend

728
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I'll let you marry whoever you want

729
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,360
Okay

730
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,920
Unless he's afraid of losing me

731
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,240
Do you have to take that thing with you?

732
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,920
My son doesn't have a girlfriend yet

733
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,040
He won't listen to you

734
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,680
When he has a girlfriend

735
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,360
he'll know who he is

736
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,200
Right, son?

737
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,760
Let me ask you

738
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,520
Wang's son is in a coma

739
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,960
Does it have anything to do with you?

740
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,920
Who?

741
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,440
I don't know him

742
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,920
You'd better do that

743
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm leaving, Su

744
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,960
Go home and sleep

745
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,480
You're leaving again

746
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,200
I don't know who you're talking about

747
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,760
What do you think?

748
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,280
Just you wait

749
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,000
I finally found you

750
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,520
I forgot that you like men.

751
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Are you avoiding me or deliberately seducing me?

752
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
I'm just trying to be nice.

753
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm just trying to be nice.

754
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
I'm just trying to be nice.

755
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Are you avoiding me or deliberately seducing me?

756
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
I'm sorry.

757
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
What's wrong?

758
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
Who did you owe 8 million to?

759
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
Don't mention it.

760
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I can't do this job anymore.

761
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
The equipment was confiscated.

762
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
If you can't do it, then don't do it.

763
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Help me think about it.

764
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Is there any other industry that I can do?

765
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
I have a relative who has a truck.

766
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
I usually just deliver goods.

767
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Why don't you work with them first?

768
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
The time is free to settle the case.

769
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
This is good.

770
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Sorry.

771
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
You're hurt?

772
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
I'll be fine after seeing you.

773
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
You're oiled.

774
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
I'm fine.

775
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
I'm fine.

776
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
I'm fine.

777
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
I'm fine.

778
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
I'm fine.

779
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
I'm fine.

780
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
I'm fine.

781
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
I'm fine.

782
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Aren't you cold?

783
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Standing outside,

784
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
of course I'm cold.

785
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
There's a horse in my car.

786
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
I love horses the most.

787
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
I'll go take a look.

788
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
The most exciting PG game on the line.

789
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
The mahjong is over.

790
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
The mahjong is over.

791
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
The prize-winning queen.

792
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
The treasure-seeking golden city.

793
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:44,800
The

794
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
reward-winning captain.

795
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
The reward-winning captain.

796
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
The reward-winning captain.

797
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
The reward-winning captain.

798
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
The reward-winning captain.

799
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
The reward-winning captain.

800
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
The reward-winning captain.

801
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
The reward-winning captain.

802
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
I'm fine.

803
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
The reward-winning captain.

804
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
The reward-winning captain.

805
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
The reward-winning captain.

806
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Why are they hanging there?

807
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Does anyone need to look out for them?

808
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
No one?

809
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,800
Open theirномуangumping honour chest.

810
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,520
Hello,

811
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,320
what can I help you?

812
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Come.

813
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Stand over there.

814
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,320
I'm waiting for you.

815
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
Come.

816
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,000
Can I have some money?

817
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,240
No, I don't.

818
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:49,220
But I have a

819
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:57,480
We've seen The Water

820
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:03,340
and I Now the Water

821
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,300
Do I have to be secretary in the company anymore?

822
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,740
No

823
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,940
So many snakes

824
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,220
And we need to raise our roast,

825
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,700
and people will watch over them

826
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,100
This is the warehouse's base.

827
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,660
Wu,

828
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,380
you're the one who was introduced by General.

829
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,220
I'm relieved.

830
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,820
But I have to remind you

831
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,140
that this batch of goods is very important.

832
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,420
It must be approved by the chairman

833
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,300
before it can be unloaded.

834
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,740
Don't worry.

835
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,100
This batch of goods

836
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
can't be opened by me, the King of Heaven.

837
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,100
I said so.

838
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,860
Okay, I believe you.

839
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,740
Okay, stop.

840
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,140
Brother.

841
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,740
Here you are.

842
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,020
What's in the car?

843
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,020
Open it.

844
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,300
Who are you?

845
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,020
Why are you here?

846
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,820
Open it.

847
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,620
Open it.

848
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,620
Open it.

849
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,620
Open it.

850
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,620
Open it.

851
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
I'm not going to fight with you.

852
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,420
The chairman said

853
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,660
that no one can open this batch of goods.

854
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,700
Brother,

855
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,220
who's looking for you?

856
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,220
Who is he?

857
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,100
He's the one who left by Xiao Chi.

858
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,220
Open it and show him.

859
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,620
What Xiao Chi?

860
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,740
No one can do it.

861
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,780
Come on.

862
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,780
Come on.

863
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Come on.

864
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,700
Mr. Guang.

865
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,420
Come on, give me a ride.

866
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,220
Give me a ride.

867
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,220
You can't drive this car.

868
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,220
I promise

869
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,460
that I can't drive it even if the King of Heaven comes.

870
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,460
What are you saying?

871
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,060
I'm the King of Heaven.

872
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,460
Brother.

873
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,580
All the goods are here.

874
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,980
Didn't you say you found it?

875
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,540
Damn it.

876
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,020
Who told you to drive my car?

877
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,620
You're pretending to be a car.

878
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,620
What's your secret?

879
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,940
I can't get the pay then.

880
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
And you.

881
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,860
I've known you for ten years.

882
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,140
What the hell do you want?

883
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,620
I have you in everything.

884
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,340
What are you doing?

885
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,900
This is our Cang Chu Department, Mr. Chi.

886
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,220
It's Cang Chu Department again.

887
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,620
I don't care which department you are.

888
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,340
Pay me.

889
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,660
How much?

890
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,660
500.

891
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,340
Guang Zi.

892
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
Pay him 5,000.

893
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,660
Come on, come here.

894
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Chi Cheng.

895
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
She's so beautiful.

896
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Yeah.

897
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,500
So nice.

898
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,980
Why are you here?

899
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,980
I'm afraid you can't catch up with others after work.

900
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
So sweet.

901
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,980
What? You envy me?

902
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,980
Do you miss me?

903
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Let's go.

904
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,980
Okay.

905
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,980
Let's go.

906
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,980
No wonder you always can't get along with me.

907
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,980
I ruined several jobs.

908
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,980
So you're Yue Yue's new boyfriend.

909
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,980
You're taking revenge on her.

910
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,980
You're not a gentleman.

911
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,980
I want to be with you.

912
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,980
I want to be with you.

913
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,980
I want to be with you.

914
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,980
I want to be with you.

915
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,980
I want to be with you.

916
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,980
I want to be with you.

917
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,980
I want to be with you.

918
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,980
I want to be with you.

919
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,980
I want to be with you.

920
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,980
I want to be with you.

921
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,980
I want to be with you.

922
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,980
I want to be with you.

923
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,980
I want to be with you.

924
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,980
I want to be with you.

925
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:35,980
I want to be with you.

926
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:43,980
Not only the sunset and the sea of moon.

927
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,980
If after today,

928
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,980
we won't come back again,

929
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:58,980
I won't change for the week.

930
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,980
I still want to tell you,

931
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:13,980
not only the stars and mountains.

932
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,980
If after today,

933
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:28,980
you won't be afraid of time.

934
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
The last night on earth.

935
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:42,980
I just want to confess to you.

936
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,980
With a heart,

937
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,980
I'll go through the end of the world.

938
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:57,980
Maybe there's no regret.

939
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,980
The last night on earth.

940
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,980
When life is long.

941
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:19,980
The moment the sea of water kisses the sky.

942
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:29,980
I'll be there with you without hesitation.
