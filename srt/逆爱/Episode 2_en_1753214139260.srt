Episode 41

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about them?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are they waiting for an answer?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the breeze blows past my face, it blows through my hair

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And tells me a few words

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The spring breeze blows, the flowers bloom

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's you, it's you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The autumn leaves fall, the winter leaves bloom

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's you, it's you

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's your art piece

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How can you let Mr. Li go back to spring?

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's not my art piece, it's the art piece of the mirror

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mirror?

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's wrong, Dawei?

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Dawei, say something

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to be alone for a while

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's okay

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're the only female nurse?

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why are you here again?

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is the clinic. Can't I come?

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's wrong with you?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can be treated now

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's lunch break now, no dinner for now

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're a small clinic, and you're still having lunch?

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What do you want?

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's okay

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The spring breeze blows

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dr. Jiang, can you use your magic

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To help me go back to spring?

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm the best at not wanting you

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm the best at not wanting you

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you ready now?

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you okay?

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Xiao Shuai

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What did you do?

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That man, he likes you, right?

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He came to the clinic to see you, right?

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, Dawei, you misunderstood me

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Xiao Shuai, I want to be your nurse

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Teach me

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Teach you what?

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Teach me how to flirt with men

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Flirt with men?

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
With whom?

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
With the guy in front of you

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
From childhood, except for Chi Cheng

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No one dared to fight with me

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you want me to say, don't bother him

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's just a softie

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There are so many people around you who are against you

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why are you fighting with him?

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What do you know?

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Aomenshin Peking Entertainment City 772772

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The most exciting PG game on the line

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The mahjong is over

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The mahjong is over

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The queen of the prize pool

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Find a gold city

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Recruit a cat, reward the captain

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
High rate of compensation

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The reward frequency is high

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There are many opportunities to take revenge

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hurry up to join

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Aomenshin Peking Entertainment City 772772

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What's the point of sending it to the mouth?

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's delicious when you eat it

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's delicious when you eat it

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's delicious

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I have to get it done quickly

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This little general

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If Chi Cheng takes it in the future

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Chi Cheng will lose

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's what happened

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is too cheap

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, I heard from the warehouse manager

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He had a boyfriend before

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If I get him

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
At that time, the complainer will be sad

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Chi Cheng knows the truth

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will be anxious to jump

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
One arrow, two birds

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Are you going to chase him?

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No, I'm going to catch him

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let him chase me in reverse

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If he is like that man just now

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In order to chase me, he will eat me

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This must be solved

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are also great

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Little handsome

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You have to help me

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I have to be discharged

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Little handsome doctor

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I am sincere

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you have a girlfriend who has been dating for three years

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You see her kiss other men

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You will understand my pain now

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Then you have to take action as soon as possible

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Collect his personal information

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Investigate his background

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Emotional experience, personality hobby

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Make an unbreakable

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Difficult plan

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are willing to help me

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I try

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Master is up

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Please accept my bow

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Shen Ke

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Say it

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Chi Cheng, twenty-eight years old

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Second generation

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Usually loves to bite snakes

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There is a black and white snake around

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is his favorite snake

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Called little vinegar bag

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He is familiar with the snake market

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Often hold snake fighting activities

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There is a yellow horse by his side

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Called yellow dragon

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In the battlefield

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nothing is left

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sit down

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Shi Yuan Duan

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is the chairman of Yuan Duan Mechanical Manufacturing Group

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Shi Yuan Duan is his father

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No wonder he wants to go to which department

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
To give me a role

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You are also a waste of time

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Don't worry

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Calm down

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Continue class

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
His love experience

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That is quite rich

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There has been no fixed contact with the object

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Shi Yuan

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Sit down

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sit down

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sit down

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All signs show

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
His skill is very good

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Very strong

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is the most important brave general in men

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
For this aspect

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you think

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Pretty good

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Just these

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What about it

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Not this meaning

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I mean

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Is hopeful

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is a bit difficult to do after the transfer

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You understand what I mean

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
After you two are together

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If he wants to do that to you

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You think you can take the initiative

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
To suppress him

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Of course

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm still working out recently

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That physical strength is definitely good

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What does it mean to suppress him

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's time to show you

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I have been hiding for many years

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Various styles

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Various tastes

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Should have

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I promise you

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Open your eyes

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm going to

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can have it in the future

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You can have it

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Master

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You before

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Have you done this before

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's better to see it after the transfer

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's just talk about it

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Stop

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Why hasn't it come yet

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It should be coming soon

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's coming

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll leave first

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Come on

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's coming

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Why is this kid again

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's coming

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll see you next week

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Come on

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Come on

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Come on

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's you again

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No no

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You said you wanted nothing

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why are you still alive so fast

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You get up quickly

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can't

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hold

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hold

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Really too tired

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is too fierce

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Handsome

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's go

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's go

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You saw the real person this time

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I thought it was overestimating you

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Now it seems to be overestimating the pool

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't have a chance to suppress him

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Unless in the dream

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Next our plan is

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Make a coincidence

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You two are one step ahead of each other

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I suppress him

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Your appearance is not bad

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Just put on a dress

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Change the style

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You are too straight now

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Have to

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Rest in peace

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Because Shicheng is very wild

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You are very aggressive at a glance

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So you have to show some color

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Behind the neck

231
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The ass is going to jump

232
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How to grab the ass

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Shicheng is coming

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Again

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Come for the first time

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I haven't seen you before

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Look at this little girl

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't touch me

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't touch you

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I want to use this kind of demon

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
A lot of men chase

242
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I really

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Since the last time I pushed the car

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No matter how I do it

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He won't look at me

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You say I can't

247
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Men can't say no

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Get the spirit

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I want to find out some new information

250
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Shicheng except for keeping snakes

251
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The biggest hobby is

252
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Big basketball

253
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If there is nothing important

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Five thirty every day

255
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He will be in the city on time

256
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Why not come

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Good ball, come again

258
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What

259
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Flipped

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Come on

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Come on

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Come on

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Here

264
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Come back

265
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Come on

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Handsome

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Give me the ball

268
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why are you talking again

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
How

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Just let you play here

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I can't

272
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Basketball court is open to you

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Come on

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't grab me

275
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Pull me up

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I have something to do

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm leaving first

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm leaving

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm leaving

280
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm leaving

281
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm leaving

282
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm leaving

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm leaving

284
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I should disappear

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Get rid of his appetite

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Here

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Come on

289
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Shicheng

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Play for a while

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't play

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Back

293
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Old friend

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Come out

295
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm After School

296
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm asking for a grind

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll play

298
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Good ball

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
How

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,880
Not this.

301
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,420
I'll get it.

302
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,560
Where is it?

303
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,760
There's a hole here.

304
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,680
Where?

305
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,520
There's a hole here.

306
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,360
I'll visit him when time is up

307
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
Then

308
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,640
let's nostalgic each other

309
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,700
and一

310
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,960
for 7 years

311
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,600
it's too painful

312
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,960
for me

313
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,360
we'll keep this promise

314
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,880
and we'll be together

315
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,840
when life is over

316
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,160
You said

317
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,040
Uncle Shen

318
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,920
didn't tell me

319
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,280
he is leaving

320
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,280
You gave me the dried beans and milk candy.

321
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Now you're giving me the half-finished candy.

322
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
You think I'm a three-year-old kid?

323
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
What do you know?

324
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,280
This candy is good for your mood.

325
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Oh.

326
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
The snake has made progress.

327
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
I was just about to tell you the progress.

328
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
There's progress.

329
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
I've already asked around.

330
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,280
I'll start learning to raise snakes tomorrow.

331
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
The morning sun is shining in the sky.

332
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
The past is unknown.

333
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Hello.

334
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Where is Mr. Wang?

335
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
I am. What's wrong?

336
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
You are Mr. Wang?

337
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
I heard that Mr. Wang has a great sense of snake farming.

338
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
I came to visit him.

339
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Move more.

340
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,280
It's okay. Slowly.

341
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Just like this.

342
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
That's it.

343
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Wow.

344
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Be gentle.

345
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Move slowly.

346
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Be careful.

347
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Are you okay?

348
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Not bad.

349
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Awesome.

350
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Good luck.

351
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
You're good.

352
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Is it fun to play the knife in your hand?

353
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Of course.

354
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
It's interesting.

355
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Didn't you say thank you?

356
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Why are you still here?

357
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Who said I came to see you?

358
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
What do you want?

359
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,280
He can't eat anything that someone else gives him.

360
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
I'm not angry.

361
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
How can you be so annoying?

362
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
How is it?

363
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Don't be envious.

364
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I prepared a gift for you.

365
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Come on.

366
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
I...

367
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
I'll call you Da Bao from now on.

368
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Why?

369
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
See you every day.

370
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Don't return it to me.

371
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Don't think that the imported skin care products are so good.

372
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
No matter how good it is, I'm not as good as Da Bao.

373
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
I don't want to give it to you.

374
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
I want it.

375
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I want it.

376
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Why are you pulling me?

377
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Give me your hand.

378
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Take it.

379
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I'm leaving.

380
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,280
To celebrate my success in the training of keeping snakes.

381
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,280
And I bought 200 snakes from the snake garden.

382
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,280
I rented two rooms and hired a junior to keep an eye on me.

383
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Next, I just need to make a plan.

384
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Let Chi Cheng jump into it.

385
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Very good.

386
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
You've been practicing for so long.

387
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
You should have a result.

388
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
How is it going with the basketball court?

389
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Are you still doing your return and return tactics?

390
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,280
When it's time to go in, go in.

391
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
You have to be full of emotions.

392
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Then you can leave.

393
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I said my purpose was to get rid of him.

394
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I'm not after him.

395
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
If you don't have enough energy,

396
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
and you can't get him,

397
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,280
you'll waste your efforts.

398
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
No.

399
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,280
I promise I'll get him within three days.

400
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
The next day

401
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Shuai Shuai.

402
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Uncle Li.

403
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Your legs and feet are not comfortable.

404
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
I told you.

405
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
I'll just go to your house.

406
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
It's okay.

407
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
What?

408
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
You're so beautiful.

409
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Don't tell anyone.

410
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Come on, Uncle Li.

411
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
Sit here.

412
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
I'll sit here.

413
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
It's okay.

414
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Okay.

415
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Come on.

416
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Slowly.

417
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Put it there.

418
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Beauty.

419
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
You're recovering well.

420
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
I'll open some more for you.

421
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Okay.

422
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Auntie.

423
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
This is enough for you.

424
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Thank you.

425
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
It's okay.

426
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Shuai.

427
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Shuai.

428
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Help me see what's wrong with the phone.

429
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
Come on, auntie.

430
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Look.

431
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
This.

432
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
And your face.

433
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
That's it.

434
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Okay, thank you.

435
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Are you okay?

436
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
I'm fine.

437
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Are you a clinic

438
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
or a community service center?

439
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
It's okay if you're busy.

440
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Go away.

441
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
You're so kind.

442
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Give us some love.

443
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,280
You don't need it.

444
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,280
Little groupie.

445
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
You're hungry, right?

446
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Come on.

447
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Let's eat.

448
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Eat.

449
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Little groupie.

450
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
Wu Suowei fed you

451
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
just once for you, right?

452
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,280
How long has he not come to see you?

453
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Eat.

454
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
You must have done it on purpose.

455
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Wu Suowei.

456
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
So handsome.

457
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Chi Shang.

458
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Chi Shang hasn't been here for a long time.

459
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
I think he's in a bad mood.

460
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Chi Shang is here.

461
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Don't bother me.

462
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
You haven't found

463
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
your snakes yet?

464
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
What?

465
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
No one is fighting with you.

466
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Your hands are itchy.

467
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I'm fine.

468
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
Brother,

469
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
there's one left.

470
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
It's really from Wang Shuo.

471
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
It's like his belt.

472
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
I can remember it wherever I go.

473
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Don't mention it to me.

474
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
I've met a boy recently.

475
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
He's very personality.

476
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
If you don't believe me,

477
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
go and see him.

478
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
I'll come back

479
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
and wait for me to catch him.

480
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Remember to sleep with my boyfriend.

481
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Go change your clothes.

482
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
You'll get sick.

483
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,280
It's okay. I'll go take a shower.

484
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Why are your pants so dirty?

485
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Don't look at my clothes.

486
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
They're cotton.

487
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
They'll be comfortable to sleep in.

488
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Let me show you.

489
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
You're here before three days.

490
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
I'm still half-asleep.

491
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,280
Xiao Shuai, help me hold it for two minutes.

492
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
I'll go hide.

493
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Okay.

494
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
Hello.

495
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Is there anything wrong?

496
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Wu Suowei is here.

497
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
He's not here?

498
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Why are you looking for him?

499
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
He should have left.

500
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
What are you doing?

501
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
I'm warning you.

502
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
This is not a guest room.

503
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
What if I'm in there?

504
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
What if it's not me?

505
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
What if it's a woman?

506
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
I'm here.

507
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
I'm here.

508
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
I'm here.

509
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
I'm here.

510
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm here.

511
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
I'm here.

512
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I'm here.

513
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
I'm here.

514
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm here.

515
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm here.

516
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
You're so good at this.

517
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Mind your image.

518
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Mind your image.

519
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
I need to take a shower.

520
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Please go out.

521
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Okay.

522
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
I'll wait for you outside.

523
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
What are you doing?

524
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
You...

525
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Tell me.

526
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
What's up?

527
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Er Bao is sick.

528
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
I'm looking for you.

529
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Er Bao?

530
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
He's sick.

531
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Why are you bringing me here?

532
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
And...

533
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
You should pay back what you owe me.

534
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
What do I owe you?

535
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Dough, jelly, eggs, lollipop.

536
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
You...

537
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
I gave it to you.

538
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Why do I owe you?

539
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
I'm asking you.

540
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
It's gone?

541
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Go buy it if it's gone.

542
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,280
No.

543
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
I'm not going.

544
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
I'm going.

545
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
I'm going.

546
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Why haven't you come to play for the past two days?

547
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
I don't want to go.

548
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
So I won't go.

549
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Why did you come before?

550
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
You're lying.

551
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
I'm lying.

552
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Don't get so close.

553
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
He's sick.

554
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Don't infect him.

555
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
You're sick?

556
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Don't listen to him.

557
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
I'm fine.

558
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
It's raining and you're running outside.

559
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
You're sweating.

560
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
How can you not be sick?

561
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Just to give you a pet,

562
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
you had to play with a mouse.

563
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
And you fell into the river.

564
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
You're home.

565
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
You came back with a 40-degree fever.

566
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Hey, handsome.

567
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Stop.

568
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Fan Jian is really a good man.

569
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
He wears his pants.

570
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,280
All the good stuff is put in the pockets of others.

571
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
He doesn't go out when he's sick.

572
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
He's afraid of infecting other people.

573
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
Mr. William.

574
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
What if he really dies in the river?

575
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,280
How much loss will it cause to the dog circle?

576
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Brother Wu!

577
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
You're here at the right time.

578
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
Brother Wu.

579
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
More than a dozen of our snakes died.

580
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
What?

581
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Go and have a look.

582
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Why did they die again?

583
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
How long will it take for your snakes to live?

584
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Why?

585
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,280
When I bought it, my master said that this snake was a wild snake.

586
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
It was supposed to feed on wild silk.

587
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
I fed it with wild silk all the way.

588
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
I only fed it with artificial silk twice.

589
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
It has nothing to do with silk.

590
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
It's a matter of the snake species.

591
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
You've been deceived.

592
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Impossible.

593
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
I've been a apprentice there for so long.

594
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
I've already gotten familiar with them.

595
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
They can't even fool the acquaintances.

596
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
I'm not a snake.

597
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
I'm a snake.

598
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
I'm a snake.

599
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
I'm a snake.

600
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
They've been a friend for so long.

601
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
They can't even fool the acquaintances.

602
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
They must have eaten something wrong.

603
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Which one?

604
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Wang's Farm.

605
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Go and ask around.

606
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
Their family has a good reputation.

607
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Wait here.

608
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Wu Suowei, something happened.

609
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Our snake died again.

610
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
It's okay.

611
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Just keep an eye on it.

612
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
I'll pay for it.

613
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
I'll share the profit with you.

614
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Don't worry.

615
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Thank you.

616
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
What's going on?

617
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Did you not learn the snake-raising technique well?

618
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
No.

619
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
There's something wrong with that snake.

620
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
It died within a month

621
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,280
after it was covered in sand.

622
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Damn.

623
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
The farms are so dark now.

624
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Most farms now

625
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
are all full of

626
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
the princes who teach the skills.

627
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
The real purpose of the students in Guangzhou

628
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
is to collect tuition fees

629
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
and sell high-quality snake-cats.

630
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Why do you still want to buy them?

631
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
For me?

632
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
How annoying.

633
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Is it because you want to get close to it

634
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
and sell it for a fee?

635
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
No.

636
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
You can't get a good deal if you have a good fortune.

637
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Then,

638
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
the good person you've worked so hard to create

639
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
is not just it.

640
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Wrong.

641
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,280
A kind person will only make people think you're fake.

642
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
On the contrary,

643
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
it's easier to be caught

644
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
by the evil spirits.

645
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
That's why people choose to be more funny.

646
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
You're really good.

647
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
I'm leaving.

648
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Chi Chang,

649
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
what are you laughing at?

650
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Someone is playing tricks on me.

651
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,280
I really want to tell you

652
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
that

653
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,280
not only the sunset and the sea of clouds

654
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
but also today

655
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,280
will not be the same

656
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,280
and the sky will not be the same

657
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
If today

658
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,280
will not come again

659
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,280
and the week will change

660
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,280
I still want to tell you

661
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,280
not only the stars or the mountains

662
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,280
but also the sunset will fall into my eyes

663
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:29,280
and you will not be afraid of time

664
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,280
The last night on earth

665
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,280
I just want to confess to you

666
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,280
and spend the last moment with all my heart

667
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Maybe there will be no regrets

668
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,280
The last night on earth

669
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,280
When life turns into dust

670
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,280
and the sea is kissing the sky

671
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
I will

672
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:31,280
hold you and leave without hesitation
