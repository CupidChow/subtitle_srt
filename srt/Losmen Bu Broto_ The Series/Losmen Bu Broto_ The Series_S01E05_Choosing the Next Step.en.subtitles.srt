1
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,875
Want some chicken, Menik? Sit down.

2
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,333
What's wrong, Sri?

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,333
Where's Jarot?

4
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,166
I haven't seen him in a while.

5
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,333
-I don't know where he is, Dad.
-Huh?

6
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:46,416
How long
are you going to fight with Jarot?

7
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,666
Are you still not speaking to each other?

8
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,125
We do talk, Mom.

9
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,458
We just haven't decided yet.

10
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,125
Fine.

11
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,208
Is Tarjo doing all right?

12
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,583
I can leave Jody.

13
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,375
Are you serious?

14
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,958
That's a question for you.

15
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,541
Are you serious?

16
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,083
We waited for you
to come eat dinner with us.

17
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,750
-I'm busy, Mom.
-Yeah, right!

18
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,541
Busy with what?
You're just staring into space.

19
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,708
I need to talk to you, Jo.

20
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,083
What is it, Mom?

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You should think long and hard
before doing anything.

22
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,791
The entire guesthouse
is talking about you.

23
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,166
Has it ever occurred to you

24
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:43,000
that your actions could bring shame
to the family and this guesthouse?

25
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,041
That this would be a disappointment
to your father and me?

26
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,625
Do you understand, Jo?

27
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,083
Yes.

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,916
I'm the dumbest person in the world, Mom.

29
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:16,833
It's all right.

30
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,125
Let this be a lesson to you.

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,791
Don't ever do it again.

32
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,500
Mom, I don't know

33
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,333
what to say to Dad.

34
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,375
For now, don't say anything to him.

35
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:37,625
Just make sure
that you cut all ties with Anna.

36
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,166
LOSMEN BU BROTO: THE SERIES

37
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,708
Keep going…

38
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,208
Keep going. Stop!

39
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:33,458
Welcome to Mrs. Broto's Guesthouse.

40
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,625
Good afternoon, miss.

41
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,750
We'd like to check in. Need a few rooms.

42
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,041
-Any rooms available?
-All right, let me check first.

43
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,625
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, miss.

44
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,791
We'd like to check in.

45
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,708
Sure, let me help.

46
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,166
-Check it, Yun.
-Yes, miss.

47
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,250
Please, have a seat.

48
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,250
-You are…
-Yes?

49
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,625
-Putra.
-Yes.

50
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,125
From Afternoon Rain band, right?

51
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,083
You know our songs?

52
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,625
-Yes, I do.
-Thank you.

53
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,458
Have a seat. Yes.

54
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,750
Menik, let's keep eating.

55
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,625
Okay? So you'll grow bigger.

56
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,708
I don't want to get bigger, Auntie.

57
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,500
Right, but if you grow bigger,
you'll be like your mom.

58
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,666
Just like Mommy.

59
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,125
No, I just want to be like you.

60
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,750
Okay. You'll be a cook, just like me.

61
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,625
-Okay.
-Right.

62
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,708
Menik, you're eating with Auntie Pur, huh?

63
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,833
Where's your mom?

64
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,833
She's taking care of guests, Mom.

65
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,375
Auntie Pur is busy cooking,

66
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,416
so why don't you come eat with me?

67
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,125
We'll look for Mommy too.

68
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,583
It's fine, Mom.

69
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,083
Don't do that, Pur. You're clearly busy.

70
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,000
You still have a lot of cooking to do.

71
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,250
Really, I'm fine, Mom.

72
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,708
Pur.

73
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,416
Give Menik a chance
to spend time with Sri.

74
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,041
Come with me, Menik.

75
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:12,708
Let's find Mommy.
We'll look at ducklings on the way. Come.

76
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,666
Tik.

77
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,416
What's up? Still feeling unsure?

78
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,208
I think I've decided.

79
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,250
-I'm leaving Jody.
-What?

80
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,291
Why? What's going on?

81
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:44,500
MRS. BROTO'S GUESTHOUSE
4, SADEWA

82
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,833
MRS. BROTO'S GUESTHOUSE

83
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,583
Take a look, Mr. Par.

84
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:00,666
This is good, miss.

85
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,416
Very neat.

86
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,833
I think you have a hidden talent.

87
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,833
I've been thinking
about putting origami in each room.

88
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,083
After cleaning them up,

89
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,375
we'll place one on the desk.

90
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,333
Good idea, miss.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,125
The guests will be pleased

92
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,250
because there's a personal touch.

93
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,666
Mr. Par, if you don't mind me asking,

94
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,000
why do you like making origami?

95
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,500
Actually, the one who liked making it

96
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,666
was my late wife.

97
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:54,250
So that's why you always make this?

98
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,666
Yes, it's my way

99
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,833
of dealing with my feelings.

100
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,916
So I can learn to let go, miss.

101
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,291
That's why I still regularly

102
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,833
visit my wife's grave.

103
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:22,375
I don’t want to deal with my feelings

104
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,041
by forgetting my wife.

105
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,166
What about you, Miss Pur?

106
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,750
Miss Pur,
there's a Pasar Kangen right now.

107
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,000
It's only held once a year.

108
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,625
They sell nostalgic snacks
that bring back memories.

109
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,625
I think you'd love it there.

110
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,708
Have a look.

111
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,666
You might find inspiration
for food at the guesthouse.

112
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,583
But who will stay here and keep an eye
on everything? There's no one else.

113
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,083
Well, if…

114
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,375
Never mind. It's okay if you can't go.

115
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,083
I'm just saying.

116
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,791
Miss, I'll take my leave.
Have to go pick up a guest.

117
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,125
-Okay, go ahead.
-Yes, miss.

118
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,625
Although… Even though…

119
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,208
When I'm feeling stuck,

120
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,833
I eat, miss.

121
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,708
Afternoon Rain has many albums, sir.

122
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,666
How can you ever feel stuck?

123
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,333
Actually, that's exactly the problem.

124
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,291
I run out of ideas.

125
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,333
Enjoying your stay here?

126
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,000
How long is your tour?

127
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,916
I like it here.

128
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,041
My tour ends next week.

129
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,083
But now I miss the times

130
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,750
when I don't have albums.

131
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,791
It felt like the ideas kept flowing.

132
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,958
Making music was easy.

133
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,583
It felt free and effortless.

134
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,791
But I should be grateful.

135
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,750
It's safe to say that I'm a success now,

136
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:12,750
but

137
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,416
there are lots of sacrifices.

138
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,916
Friends, family…

139
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,208
Oh, are you married?

140
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,000
How can I? Who would want me?

141
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,416
Always on the road. Always touring… Right?

142
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:35,833
It's hard to be married
if you want to be a successful musician.

143
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,666
Sorry. I didn't mean to vent.

144
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,916
It's okay.

145
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,583
Although… I don't really agree with you.

146
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,291
I'm sure there's a way
to juggle both of them.

147
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,916
Because we choose what we love

148
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,458
so we can keep it, right?

149
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:08,208
If you only get to keep one of them,

150
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,583
maybe that's your choice.

151
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,666
Whereas other people

152
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,625
can juggle both of them.

153
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,208
Because that's their choice.

154
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,916
If there really is a way,

155
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,208
I'd like to know.

156
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,375
Well?

157
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,083
What's your plan?

158
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,791
Nothing yet.

159
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,083
It's fine.

160
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,375
I can manage on my own.

161
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,750
Sri, you don't have
to do everything by yourself.

162
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,750
I enjoy helping you.

163
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,625
Taking care of Menik.
Playing chef with her.

164
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,083
Pur.

165
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,375
Do you think

166
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,416
I've been a good mother to Menik?

167
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,958
Why would you think that?

168
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,875
No reason.

169
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,541
It's just that I've been busy at work.

170
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,958
I leave Menik all the time.

171
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,458
In fact, it seems like

172
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:43,333
Menik is closer to you
and loves you more than me.

173
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,333
Sri, you're a great mother.

174
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,375
You can't give up.

175
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,833
Keep chasing your dreams
so you can be an inspiration to Menik.

176
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,333
You love Mommy, don't you, Menik?

177
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,375
She does.

178
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,291
Pur.

179
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,625
I'm really grateful to you.

180
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,750
But the truth is,
I don't want to hold you back.

181
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,541
Hold me back, how?

182
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,083
I don't want you

183
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,000
to feel

184
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:24,500
obligated to manage the guesthouse
while looking after Menik.

185
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,791
The guesthouse and Menik
have never been a burden to me.

186
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,125
They make me happy.

187
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:35,250
Especially Menik. She brings me joy.

188
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,916
What about Mr. Par?

189
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,500
Where have you been, Mo?

190
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,625
They need you to change the bedsheets.

191
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,625
Can't you see that I'm busy?

192
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,041
Busy doing what?

193
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:06,500
Can't you see? I'm digging a hole.

194
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,958
For what?

195
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,750
For a celebration!

196
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,166
I'm digging a hole
to bury my head and body,

197
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,125
my past…

198
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,291
Whatever I want.

199
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,375
You seem happy, Mo.

200
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,500
You spit on me.

201
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,291
Why can't we do this at the guesthouse?

202
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,708
I don't want
to be alone with you there anymore.

203
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,708
Doesn't feel right.

204
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,458
People are talking.

205
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,958
Why do you care so much
about what people say?

206
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,708
Enough. I don't want to discuss that.

207
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,833
TWS can't accept your money.

208
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,208
Because of Sekar?

209
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,750
I don't want to give my money

210
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,375
or fund irresponsible people anyway.

211
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't get what you're talking about.

212
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,500
We're talking about TWS.

213
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,916
It's the same thing!

214
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,083
Be it professionally or personally,

215
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,500
I can't deal with irresponsible people.

216
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,666
You have no right

217
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,583
to make me fall for you

218
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,000
and then leave me just like that.

219
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,208
Were you just messing with me?

220
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,166
Aren't you the one messing with me?

221
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,750
You're the one with a husband.

222
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,083
There you go again.

223
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,958
I have a husband. That's my business.

224
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,500
Our thing is a different story.

225
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,041
Hello, Jody.

226
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,416
I want a divorce.

227
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:12,375
"A BEAUTIFUL THING
FOR A BEAUTIFUL PERSON" - PARTONO

228
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,416
Jo?

229
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,250
-What are you doing here?
-Sekar.

230
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,500
It's late, Jo.

231
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,250
I want to apologize.

232
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,125
MISS ANNA

233
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,416
Just deal with your business first.

234
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,208
Sekar!

235
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:59,041
That movement
attracted the ants that he just saw.

236
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,208
The ants…

237
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,083
Come in.

238
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,958
Daddy!

239
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,333
Hey!

240
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh my!

241
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,625
I brought this for you.

242
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,625
Here you go.

243
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:22,958
Open it.

244
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,583
Do you like it?

245
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,125
When will you come home?

246
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,750
Not in front of Menik.

247
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,750
I'm just asking.

248
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:43,791
I miss you.

249
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,875
Menik, Daddy said something.

250
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:49,958
He misses us.

251
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,208
You miss Daddy too, right?

252
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,041
Really?

253
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,875
-Yes.
-You miss me too?

254
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,625
What about Mommy? Does she miss me?

255
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,916
Mommy misses Daddy too.

256
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,875
Well, if we all miss each other,

257
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,583
let's go home.

258
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,208
Well, I want that too.

259
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,208
But when Mommy talks with Daddy,
we never seem to click.

260
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,208
That's not true.

261
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,875
We talk

262
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,291
just fine.

263
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,291
There are a lot of people out there
who don't even talk.

264
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,625
Talking is one thing.

265
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,958
Understanding each other is another thing.

266
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,458
We want different things.

267
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,666
Isn't that worse?

268
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:51,666
Well, we can talk it through again.

269
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,833
Make compromises.

270
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,416
I still don't understand
what the problem is.

271
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,625
We really can't go to the Netherlands
if we're still like this.

272
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,583
Don't say that, Sri.

273
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,750
This is important to me.

274
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,291
I know that.

275
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,666
You can go by yourself.

276
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,083
Menik and I will stay here.

277
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,958
Come here. I'll read it again.

278
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,500
Want to keep going?

279
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,041
Mom, where's Menik?

280
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,750
With her mother.

281
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,250
Never mind that.
Let Menik spend time with her mother.

282
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,541
I'm saying this

283
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,041
because it'll be hard for you and Menik

284
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,750
if they eventually decide
to go to the Netherlands.

285
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:58,125
I think the time you spend with Menik

286
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:02,208
can be used to take care of yourself.

287
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,041
Okay, Mom. I'll try.

288
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,041
This smells good. Is it done?

289
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,125
Just need to fry it.

290
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,208
Okay, I'll get the cooking oil.

291
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,291
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning. Going to the market? Okay.

292
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:26,208
Mom, here's your ginger tea.

293
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,208
Thanks, Pur.

294
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,541
Something wrong, Mom?

295
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,666
Another deficit?

296
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,958
Another deficit?

297
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,291
No.

298
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:43,958
I just wanted to make sure
the numbers all add up

299
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,625
according to your calculations.

300
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,916
All right. I'll head back to the kitchen.

301
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,708
-Wait a minute, Pur.
-Yes?

302
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,666
Hold on.

303
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,333
Listen.

304
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:07,750
Maybe you've been too busy
at the guesthouse.

305
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,916
You should go out once in a while.

306
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,541
Look around. See the things that you like.

307
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,833
Get some fresh air.

308
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:24,208
If there's anything you'd like to share,
I'm here for you.

309
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:28,875
Yes, Mom.

310
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,875
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

311
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,791
I understand that, Sri.

312
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:48,625
No one can understand a problem better

313
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:53,166
than the person who's facing it.

314
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:59,916
But if you don't mind,
let me weigh in regarding your dilemma.

315
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,625
But you and Mom
are different from Jarot and I.

316
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,583
Even the times are different.

317
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,041
That's true.

318
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:14,416
Times have changed,
and so have the people.

319
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,875
But remember,

320
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:21,916
all marriages need one thing.

321
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,833
Commitment.

322
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,166
Times may change,

323
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:33,541
but a marriage commitment
shouldn't be defeated by changing times.

324
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:38,083
It's not like
I'm not committed to Jarot, Dad.

325
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,333
It's not about your commitment to Jarot,

326
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,041
to me, to your mother, or someone else.

327
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,708
It's not that.

328
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:50,458
But your commitment to yourself.

329
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:56,916
It's difficult, Mom.

330
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,708
Everything is complicated.

331
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,583
Then make it uncomplicated.

332
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,333
Don't make it more complicated.

333
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:09,583
What do you think?

334
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,625
I've tried my best
to make it less complicated.

335
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,833
And I think
I've become a better version of myself.

336
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But somehow,

337
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,833
it only makes it messier.

338
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,541
Don't talk like that.

339
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,750
If you think like that,

340
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,500
then you'll feel
like you can't overcome this problem.

341
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,125
There is no such thing
as a plan without obstacles.

342
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:46,166
But if the first plan fails,

343
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,750
that means there is a better plan.

344
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,625
That's what I'm hoping for.

345
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,250
It's difficult, Dad.

346
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,458
I keep getting angry.

347
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,041
That's okay. It's normal.

348
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,750
Just vent all of your feelings
towards Jarot.

349
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,750
Let it all out. It's fine.

350
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,833
It's healthy for your relationship.

351
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,041
And it's even better for you.

352
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,041
But don't go overboard.

353
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,416
There's a time for everything.

354
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:19,041
When I first saw your artwork,

355
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:23,458
I thought, "How can you turn useless junk

356
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:27,000
into something beautiful?"

357
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,125
You gave it meaning.

358
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,750
So I think,

359
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,291
and I'm sure,

360
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:40,250
you can turn this complicated mess

361
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:45,250
into something beautiful
and meaningful in your life.

362
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,083
All right, Mom.

363
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,083
Thank you, Mom.

364
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:01,916
I'll try to talk it out with Sri.

365
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,041
No need to rush.

366
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:08,916
Give Sri some time to calm down.

367
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:11,583
Okay, Mom.

368
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,708
I'm sure you can cook it better
for the guesthouse.

369
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,791
-The market extends all the way there?
-Yes.

370
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,833
NGASEM MARKET

371
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:54,125
Miss Pur, there's sticky rice
with grated coconut there.

372
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,458
Haven't seen that in a while.

373
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,000
Mr. Par, don't stray too far from me.

374
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:02,750
It's been a while
since I've been in a crowd like this.

375
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:06,916
Right, don't worry. I'll take care of you.

376
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:11,958
-Ma'am, how much is this?
-It's fine, Miss Pur. Let me pay.

377
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,416
Here.

378
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,125
Here you go, ma'am.

379
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,291
It's good, but not sweet enough.

380
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,208
Wow, are you hungry?

381
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:27,708
I guess I am.

382
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,291
Mr. Par, I'm sorry.

383
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,583
May I ask you something?

384
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,875
Sure. What do you want to know?

385
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,333
Forgive me.

386
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:49,250
I heard about your late wife.

387
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:54,458
If you don't mind me asking,
when did she pass away?

388
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:57,791
Two years ago.

389
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,416
Because of a heart attack.

390
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:05,500
And how are you holding up?

391
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,791
It's still difficult for me, miss.

392
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,833
How about you, miss?

393
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,000
I've already made my peace.

394
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,375
Even though
I still think about it sometimes.

395
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:26,875
Now I want to ask you something.

396
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,291
How did you make peace with it?

397
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:33,791
Actually, I wanted to ask you about that.

398
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:37,125
How do you hide your feelings
when you're crushed inside?

399
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,041
Well,

400
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,375
we just have to fight it.

401
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:49,125
Don't give in to that devastated feeling.

402
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,791
Miss Pur,

403
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,958
when the guesthouse isn't too busy…

404
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,958
is it okay if I take you out…

405
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,291
for a walk?

406
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,458
I'll think about it.

407
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:44,916
What is it, Bagus?

408
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,041
What?

409
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:53,416
Where?

410
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,208
Jo.

411
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:05,791
This is bad.

412
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,166
She keeps provoking the bartender.
It's insane.

413
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,666
Go check on her.

414
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,291
Thanks.

415
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,708
Wake up, miss.

416
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,416
You okay, Miss Anna?

417
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,083
-I--
-No one cares about me.

418
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,333
Let's just go home.

419
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,250
Miss, let's go.

420
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,875
Can you stand up? Come on.

421
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:31,500
Can you stand?

422
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,833
There you go. Let's go.

423
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:36,416
Take it easy.

424
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,041
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

425
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,625
Let it all out.

426
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,750
Shall I get water?

427
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,041
What are you doing here?

428
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,166
I told you not to look for me.

429
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,291
That's enough…

430
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,416
-We'll talk at home.
-It's your fault.

431
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:11,000
If I never met you,
I'd still be with Jody.

432
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,333
That's enough. Calm down.

433
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,250
Now my life is a mess!

434
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,750
I've got no one left.

435
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,083
I might as well just die!

436
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:33,875
Get off me!

437
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,333
-What's going on here?
-Nothing, sir.

438
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,125
Just a family issue.
We're waiting for a cab.

439
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:41,666
Come on.

440
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,125
Get up.

441
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:45,541
Come on.

442
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,791
Let's go.

443
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:55,291
Calm down, Jody.

444
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,041
Don't try to hide something from me.

445
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,458
I've been calling Anna,
but she's not answering.

446
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,333
Is she all right over there?

447
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,916
Mr. Broto, please be honest with me.

448
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:08,750
Everything's okay. Trust me.

449
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,833
Nothing unusual.

450
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:15,916
Anna occasionally goes out.
Says she wants to soak in Yogyakarta.

451
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,833
That means it's all good, right?

452
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,625
Then why did she call in the middle
of the day, asking for a divorce?

453
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:26,250
She said there's someone else.
Is that true?

454
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,500
She asked for a divorce?

455
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,458
About that…

456
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,541
Wait… I don't know how to respond to that.

457
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,291
Please, you have to inform me immediately.

458
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,875
Yes, Jody… Hello?

459
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,500
What on earth? Jo?

460
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,250
What is this?

461
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,166
Huh?

462
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,666
-Careful.
-Jo!

463
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,583
What's going on here, Jo?

464
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:55,791
Anna, are you okay?

465
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:57,500
Jo.

466
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,833
Can you explain this? What's going on?

467
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,000
-Jo!
-It's…

468
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,916
She had too much to drink at a club.

469
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Hold on. Let me get some water.

470
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,000
-Don't leave me.
-Okay.

471
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,791
Just hold on. Let me get some water.

472
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,000
-Jo. She was drinking?
-Yes. Hang on, Dad.

473
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,416
She's drunk?

474
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,041
Anna.

475
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:32,500
Jody called earlier.

476
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:36,958
He said he tried calling you repeatedly,
but you didn't answer.

477
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:39,041
He wanted to know what was wrong.

478
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,375
If I may know, what's going on?

479
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,500
I see…

480
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,250
Now he's looking for me.

481
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:54,541
-Pardon me?
-Now he's looking for me.

482
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,375
Just tell him

483
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,750
to stop it, sir.

484
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,125
No need to look for me.

485
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,291
What do you mean?

486
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:05,375
No need to look for me.
I'm already with someone else.

487
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,291
What do you mean?

488
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,291
Someone else?

489
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,875
I've fallen in love with your son.

490
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,875
I'm in love with Tarjo.
