1
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:10,083
So that's the chronology, Mr. Lukman.

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,541
It wasn't my husband who started it.

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:14,875
All right, Mrs. Broto.

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:19,791
The important thing is
we have a chronology of the events.

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,500
Let me discuss this with the police first.

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:27,000
But now that we have this,
my husband should be released.

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:33,083
Well, I do agree that the treatment
of Mr. Broto is a little bit extreme.

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,041
I know, right?

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,208
But it is what it is, ma'am.

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,125
The police take action
based on police reports.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,833
Therefore, this isn't my decision to make.

12
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,958
But don't worry.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,291
Once they withdraw the complaint,
your husband will be released.

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:54,625
Should I… try talking with Jody, sir?

15
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,875
I advise against it.

16
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,166
If he's still on edge,

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,416
you risk making the situation worse.

18
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,958
I'm worried about my husband's well-being
at the police station.

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,083
LOSMEN BU BROTO: THE SERIES

20
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,708
-Miss Pur.
-Mr. Par.

21
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,000
Not driving any guests today?

22
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,708
It's my day off.

23
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,166
Anything I can help you with?

24
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,916
Sure. You can help stir this slowly.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,833
Okay.

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,208
Why are you alone here, miss?

27
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,416
Where's Yuni?

28
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,375
It's not time to cook yet.

29
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,708
Then why are you cooking
earlier than usual?

30
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,250
I'm scared.

31
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,833
I'm scared something will happen to Dad.

32
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:16,916
Miss,

33
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:22,666
don't stress over things
that might not even happen.

34
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,791
Miss Pur,

35
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:36,458
if your tears fall into the soup,
it might make it salty.

36
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,000
-All good, sir?
-Of course. It's great.

37
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,000
Jarot's waiting for you outside.

38
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,625
I'll leave now.

39
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,416
What is it, honey?

40
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,291
I'm not going to the Netherlands.

41
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,541
Huh? Why not?

42
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,666
Problems with the sponsor?

43
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,541
No, it's not that.

44
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:32,666
I want to stay here in Indonesia
for you and Menik.

45
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,875
Wait a minute.

46
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,458
You… canceled the trip
because of Menik and me?

47
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,375
Yes.

48
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,916
Why did you do that?

49
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,375
What is it that you want?

50
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:52,916
Whether you leave
for the Netherlands or not,

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,291
I don't mind.

52
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,916
But don't use us as your excuse.

53
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,166
Obviously, Menik and I want you
to be successful in your career.

54
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,541
If I leave,

55
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,041
we'll be…

56
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,958
Everything will become more complicated.

57
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,666
What about your singing?

58
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,958
Which part will be complicated?

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,958
If you want to go, just go.

60
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:18,958
I…

61
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,583
I can continue my music career here.

62
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,333
I don’t want to break up our family.

63
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,541
It's fine. Just a little bit.

64
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,458
Honey.

65
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,208
What is it, honey?

66
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,916
What did they do to you?

67
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,916
I spilled coffee on myself. It's fine.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,416
It's all good.

69
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,333
Yeah.

70
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,375
Don't lie to me.

71
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,750
The officers here are nice.

72
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,208
They occasionally give me coffee

73
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,541
or buy me snacks from the market…

74
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,583
They're all yummy.

75
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,625
Are you being serious, honey?
Don't you dare lie to me.

76
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,958
I'm serious. It's true.

77
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,708
Really.

78
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,541
How are… the kids, honey?

79
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,833
They're fine. We all miss you.

80
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,333
How are you doing over there?
Are you well?

81
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,708
I'm well, honey.

82
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:37,625
I'm fine.

83
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,958
I can't sleep without you here.

84
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,458
I have a hard time sleeping, too,
without you.

85
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,625
I keep tossing and turning.
Can't stay asleep.

86
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,750
Do you know why?

87
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,291
Too many mosquitoes.

88
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,083
Stop joking around.

89
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,916
All right, honey.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,875
I just wanted to prove to you
that I'm well and just fine.

91
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,458
All right?

92
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,083
Come on, honey.

93
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,250
I've only been gone for two days,
but you're already anxious.

94
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,916
Hasn't Jody reached out to you, honey?

95
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,291
He… Never mind that, honey.

96
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,500
Just let it go.
It's not a problem if he doesn't.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,375
-It's okay.
-All right.

98
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,208
Don't get too comfortable
at the police station.

99
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,583
Of course not, honey.

100
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,500
I'd rather be comfortable by your side.

101
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,333
All right, then.

102
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,000
Take care, honey.

103
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,041
All right.

104
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,458
Ji Hae.

105
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,416
Calm down.

106
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,958
It's okay.

107
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:14,916
Atmo.

108
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,708
I'm really scared.

109
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, dear.

110
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,166
Play with this.

111
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,125
Ji Hae.

112
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,666
Calm down.

113
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,541
It's okay.

114
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,833
Tak bantu. I can help you.

115
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,333
You speak to your mother.

116
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,166
Say it like this.

117
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,166
Oh, my mother.

118
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:50,625
Allow me to convey
what lies within my heart.

119
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
It's that I love you.

120
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,166
Tell her that.

121
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,125
Do you get it?

122
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,333
You don't?

123
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,416
Damn it, this is hard.

124
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,791
I'm really scared. What should I do?

125
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,708
Oh dear.

126
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,791
Mom.

127
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,208
I don't want to get married.
I don't want this arrangement.

128
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,250
I'm in love with someone else.

129
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,583
Ji Hae.

130
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,416
I miss you.

131
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,041
My Korea…

132
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,958
Daddy!

133
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:32,916
Hey!

134
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,625
I miss you.

135
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,458
Menik misses Daddy too.

136
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,166
-Really?
-Really.

137
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,250
You miss me too?

138
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,916
What about Mommy? Does she miss me too?

139
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,833
Go to sleep, sweetheart.

140
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,041
We need to talk.

141
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,250
You first.

142
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,750
I want to apologize, honey,

143
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,291
about that label offer the other day.

144
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,791
I shouldn't have made
a decision by myself.

145
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,083
I should've discussed it with you first.

146
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,291
And I should've been more understanding.

147
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,750
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,458
Okay.

149
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,666
I accept your apology.

150
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,458
I'm not angry with you.

151
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,000
Whatever you decide,

152
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,708
I will always support you.

153
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:58,083
I just want you to be happy.

154
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,875
Successful.

155
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,208
That's it.

156
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,500
Thank you so much.

157
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,666
Thank you for understanding.

158
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,041
Your support means the world to me.

159
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,458
You need to reconsider.

160
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,125
If you go to the Netherlands,

161
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,083
I'm sure you'll be happy too.

162
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,416
I'm going to miss you.

163
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,250
I'm going to miss you and Menik.

164
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,500
We're going to miss you too.

165
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,875
Thank you, honey.

166
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:07,208
Thank you because you keep fighting.

167
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,541
For me.

168
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,708
For Menik.

169
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,750
For our little family.

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,916
Thank you, honey.

171
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,375
The discounted price alone
is eight million.

172
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,291
This one is nine million.

173
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,541
Atmo, you will come here
for chuseok, right?

174
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,625
Ji Hae, the ticket is so expensive.

175
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,375
But don't worry.

176
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,375
It may be expensive, but I love you.

177
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,791
I love you too. And I really miss you.

178
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,875
It's okay. I will come.

179
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,916
Atmo, I love you.

180
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,500
I love you.

181
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,041
Yun.

182
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,250
-What is it?
-Come sit here.

183
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,125
What is it?

184
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,708
How can I make some quick money?

185
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,041
-OL.
-What's that?

186
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,125
Online loans.

187
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,041
-How do I get it?
-It's easy.

188
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:32,000
You take a picture of yourself,
along with your ID card. Like a selfie.

189
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,208
But later on, if you borrow one million,
you'll pay two million.

190
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,166
Borrow two million, pay five million.

191
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,458
That's messed up!

192
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,041
I'm just kidding.

193
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,416
How about asking Mrs. Broto
for a salary advance?

194
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,250
I bet she won't mind.

195
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,916
Yun,

196
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:58,541
I don't want to mix
business with pleasure.

197
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,875
You and your pride.

198
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,208
What's wrong, Mr. Par?

199
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,958
Did Miss Pur blow you off?

200
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,041
Don't talk like that, Yun.

201
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,333
Am I not worthy enough for her?

202
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,541
With all due respect,

203
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:42,125
she likes tall, big, and handsome men,
like the late Mr. Anton.

204
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,208
Whereas you…

205
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,583
Just kidding. Sorry.

206
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,291
Do you want me to give you a makeover?

207
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,041
I'll turn you into a Korean oppa.

208
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,333
-What do you say?
-No way, Yun.

209
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,666
Miss Pur will hate me even more.

210
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,541
-She doesn't like that kind of stuff.
-Mr. Par.

211
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,458
Mr. Atmo,
the ugliest guy in Southeast Asia,

212
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,250
managed to get a Korean girl. How?

213
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,583
It was all thanks to me!

214
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,208
-Come over here. Just trust me.
-Yun.

215
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,458
-Sit down.
-What are you going to do?

216
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,375
Wait a minute.

217
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,666
Let me see. Your best look is…

218
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,458
Good grief.

219
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,791
-Yun.
-There you go.

220
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,750
Here. Face this way. There you go! Okay.

221
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,250
I'll turn you into a K-pop oppa.

222
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,458
Seriously, this looks good on you.
So cool!

223
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,208
-Jung Kook?
-"Wrong look" is more like it.

224
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,625
-Not Jung Kook. He's more like Ji Min!
-Wrong look!

225
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,958
Just go away! Don't interrupt us!

226
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,666
Mr. Par Ji Min
will declare his love to Miss Pur.

227
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,500
Hey, Yun! Why not broadcast it?

228
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,333
Put up an announcement at the city hall!

229
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,291
Mr. Par.

230
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,416
If I may offer a suggestion.

231
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,375
If you're really going to do this,

232
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,291
first of all, don't mess with her heart.

233
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:06,375
Second of all, are you ready
to face the Broto family?

234
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,333
Oh man.

235
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,375
Of course I'm not messing around, Atmo.

236
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,791
Since the death of my wife…

237
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,291
I've never been interested in anyone else.

238
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,083
But Miss Pur is different.

239
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,875
Mr. Lukman, is there any update?

240
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,458
Any good news for me?

241
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,875
My apologies, ma'am.
I've done everything by the book.

242
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,583
But it appears
that this case could drag on.

243
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,833
Oh no. How come, sir?
It's been a few days now.

244
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,166
But there's still no progress?

245
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes, ma'am, I understand,

246
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,125
but it's not that easy.

247
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,625
Please be patient.

248
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,250
All right, Mr. Lukman.
I'll be waiting for the good news.

249
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,333
Thank you.

250
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,500
Hello?

251
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,541
Can you spare some time to meet up?

252
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,375
-Mommy!
-Excuse me.

253
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,166
Sweetheart! My gosh, Menik.

254
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,041
My gosh!

255
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,708
You look so beautiful.

256
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,791
-Really?
-Yes.

257
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,500
You said yes without looking at me.

258
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,375
Yes.

259
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,666
Thank you, sweetheart.

260
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,708
I'm so proud of you, Sri.

261
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,291
Thank you, honey.

262
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,541
I'll be very happy

263
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,333
if we both succeed in what we do.

264
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,125
You achieve your goals,

265
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,750
and I also achieve my dreams.

266
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,875
All while we're raising Menik together.

267
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,041
I'm confident that by the time you return,

268
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,375
you’ll have plenty of stories
to proudly share with Menik.

269
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,416
Right?

270
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,625
Honey, when I'm done
with my business here,

271
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,666
I'll fly to you as soon as I can, okay?

272
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,541
Never mind that.
For now, just focus on tonight.

273
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,750
All right.

274
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,625
Let me fix your hair.

275
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,375
-Let me…
-Miss Sri, please stand by on stage.

276
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,208
That's my cue.

277
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,833
Sweetheart, I have to go.

278
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,416
Watch me with Daddy, okay?

279
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,291
-I'm heading out now.
-Okay.

280
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,458
CULTURE FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW

281
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,541
FOR ANNA

282
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,250
I love you.

283
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,583
Yes, ma'am?

284
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,250
Good evening, Jody.

285
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:07,041
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

286
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:12,291
I don't have much time,
so please just get to the point.

287
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:17,583
I'd like to apologize
for this whole misunderstanding.

288
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:23,125
We're willing to cooperate
throughout this entire process.

289
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:29,125
However, will you be willing to reconsider

290
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:33,250
so we can settle this matter amicably?

291
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,375
I've made up my mind, ma'am.

292
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,166
Let's just go along with this process.

293
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,000
Listen, Jody.

294
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:46,875
My husband and I raised our children

295
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:49,458
to have a virtuous personality.

296
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,291
There must be a cause and effect
in this entire incident.

297
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,250
This is not entirely Tarjo's fault.

298
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,375
Jody.

299
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,333
Maybe you should read this.

300
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,625
You have a very talented wife.

301
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:13,500
By reading this, you will realize

302
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:19,791
that there's a whole lot more
to Anna than you think.

303
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:27,125
And… she needs you by her side.

304
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,083
Excuse me, miss. There's a letter for you.

305
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,416
Okay.

306
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,833
Miss Anna,

307
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,958
I'd like to thank you

308
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,333
for everything that we've been through.

309
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,500
Every moment with you

310
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,625
truly opened my eyes to life and dreams.

311
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,041
From this experience,

312
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,958
I realized the importance
of maintaining boundaries.

313
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm sorry because I still have to learn
about relationships

314
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,250
and how our actions
can affect other people.

315
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:15,666
Now I know
that this problem didn't just affect us,

316
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,250
but it also had an impact
on the entire guesthouse.

317
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,416
We were once at the same crossroads.

318
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,791
And now, even though
it's time to go our separate ways,

319
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:30,083
I hope you can understand how I feel.

320
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,166
For many months, this bed has been empty.

321
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,500
The longer you're gone, the quieter
it gets in the space we once called home.

322
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:45,500
With high hopes,
I kept this room tidy and neat

323
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,916
as if you were going to come back
and everything would be as it once was.

324
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,458
However, you said
this independence would kill me.

325
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:01,500
I say it's impossible
because your indifference killed me first.

326
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:08,125
If someday you come home
and you find me as cold as this room,

327
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,416
just know that I have died inside.

328
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,416
Forgive me, Anna.

329
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:13,666
I…

330
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,250
I failed you as a husband.

331
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,541
I went about it the wrong way.

332
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,541
I just wanted your attention.

333
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,375
But I handled it poorly.

334
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,166
I need you.

335
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,166
Don't leave me.

336
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,833
Please don't leave me.

337
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,458
From now on, let's move forward together.

338
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:09,791
FOR ANNA

CULTURE FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW

340
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:35,666
Since our last guidance meeting,

341
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,666
there's still no progress, Jo?

342
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,416
No developments?

343
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,500
If it's just a business plan

344
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,083
that can't be applied,

345
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,916
it means that this concept
has yet to be validated.

346
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,833
You just need
one more supporting document.

347
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,250
An investment letter.

348
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,458
Evidence that shows

349
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:03,166
an investor is interested in this plan.

350
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,666
The deadline is close, Jo.

351
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,625
You might not have enough time
for a review.

352
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,291
Am I being clear, Jo?

353
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:16,333
Do you understand what I'm saying?

354
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:17,833
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

355
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:18,916
Take this seriously.

356
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,208
Okay.
