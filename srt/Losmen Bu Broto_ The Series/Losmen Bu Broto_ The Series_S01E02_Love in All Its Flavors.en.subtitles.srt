1
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,500
Sri.

2
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,541
-Need my help to put it on?
-Hang on.

3
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:10,875
No need.

4
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,916
Good grief. This is such a hassle.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,375
Why do I need to come, anyway?

6
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,875
Why can't you attend the meeting
by yourself?

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:22,166
Sri, they're going to sponsor me
to work in the Netherlands.

8
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,166
It's only natural
that they want to meet my family.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,875
But I haven't finished my contract
in Bandung.

10
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,125
This puts me…

11
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,250
Fine, I'm sorry.
But this is very important for us.

12
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,750
Let's go, we're already late. Hurry.

13
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,666
Wait up.

14
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,083
-Ma'am.
-Hi!

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,583
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

16
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,166
-It's okay.
-Hello.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,583
I'm the one who's grateful
because you took the time to come here.

18
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,125
You must be tired.

19
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,375
-Sort of.
-Sri, you came here from Bandung?

20
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:54,958
Yes, I did.

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,750
And this must be Menik.

22
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,708
Hi, beautiful.

23
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,083
Still tired from the trip?

24
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,041
Jarot, Sri, this is Danique.

25
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,250
Curator of the gallery in Amsterdam.

26
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,041
He's very interested in your work.

27
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,333
-I'm Jarot.
-Hi.

28
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,291
-Yes.
-Please, sit.

29
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,208
What did he say earlier, Sri?

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,833
I almost forgot. Danique mentioned

31
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,416
that he would like
to support Jarot's exhibition.

32
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,791
The plan is, Jarot can do residency there

33
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:04,291
for a year
while also working on a new art piece,

34
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,458
which will be displayed
at Danique's exhibition.

35
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,583
-Okay.
-Yes.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,958
Do we have to give
an answer right now, ma'am?

37
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,000
Not really.
But please get back to us in a week

38
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:38,041
so we have enough time to include this
in the monthly program agenda.

39
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,166
We'll discuss it privately first, ma'am.

40
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,291
-Right?
-Okay.

41
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,125
LOSMEN BU BROTO: THE SERIES

42
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,000
Nice.

43
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,333
Turn around, Oppa.

44
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,000
Turn around. There you go.

45
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,208
There you go!

46
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,458
Huh? To be continued?

47
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,750
Such a shame. Only one more episode left.

48
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:56,708
Damn.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,416
It's already 2:30 a.m.

50
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,333
Come on, you can do it.

51
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,541
Okay. One soto ayam for Mr. Andi,
is it ready?

52
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,666
One chicken porridge for Mrs. Rosa.

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,041
Don't forget to add sweet soy sauce.

54
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,583
And two chicken feet soto for Mrs. Fitri.
Is it done?

55
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,083
Mrs. Fitri's order is done, Mom.

56
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,625
Honey, how's the pecel coming along?

57
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,375
Darn it. Ndro.

58
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,916
-Any spinach left?
-All gone, ma'am.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,791
-Darn it. Where's Atmo?
-Haven't seen him this morning.

60
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,208
-This is bad.
-Fine, then.

61
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll do the shopping. That's okay.

62
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,916
-Okay. Sorry, honey.
-No problem.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,458
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

64
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,333
-Morning, miss.
-Morning, Jo.

65
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,625
Miss, I'm sorry about--

66
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,541
Jo, I'm in the middle of an idea.
Hold that thought.

67
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,708
Miss.

68
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,750
-Are you--
-Jo.

69
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,000
Please wait. Let me write first, okay?

70
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,083
Miss, about last night…

71
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:56,750
I…

72
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,125
What about last night?

73
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,791
Nothing happened.

74
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,750
Annyeong-seo.

75
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,833
Where have you been, Mo?

76
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,083
-Fix your blangkon.
-Right, my apologies, ma'am.

77
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,166
Good morning, ma'am. Sorry I'm late.

78
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,125
Fine, just go get the laundry.

79
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,166
-Agleseumnida.
-Huh? What?

80
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,500
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,625
Weirdo.

82
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,833
-Jo.
-Dad.

83
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,708
Come and have breakfast.

84
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,666
I already ate some bread in my bedroom.

85
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,291
This is a new menu.
Basil fried rice, cooked by Pur.

86
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,375
Come on, try it.

87
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,583
Come have breakfast with me
once in a while.

88
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,083
Sit down.

89
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,916
It's tasty.

90
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,250
Delicious!

91
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,750
-It's good, Dad?
-It's amazing.

92
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,375
-Jo.
-Yeah, Dad?

93
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,500
When accompanying a female guest,

94
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,833
it's best not to stay out too late.

95
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,416
Could leave a bad impression. Got it?

96
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,250
Did someone say something?

97
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,333
-Nothing happened, Dad.
-It's just a precaution.

98
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,666
Anna's husband is my friend.

99
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,791
He left his wife here with us.
We should take good care of her.

100
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:01,916
-Damn!
-What is it?

101
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,416
What is it?

102
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,583
-There's a pebble inside the rice!
-A pebble?

103
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,875
Pebble?

104
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,916
But tell Pur that it's tasty.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,333
The fried rice is delicious.

106
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,791
Nonsense.

107
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,750
There's no pebble.

108
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,500
It's hard to talk to kids these days.

109
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,250
That kid. Good grief!

110
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,416
Jo.

111
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,791
-Yes?
-Where are we going today?

112
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,583
I can't drive you today.

113
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,000
I want to talk--

114
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,791
That's okay. I'll accompany you
wherever you're going.

115
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,166
It's not that, but…

116
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,458
I… actually want to--

117
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,291
About our kiss yesterday?

118
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,041
So you do remember?

119
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,708
Of course I remember.

120
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,416
Listen.

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,875
For me, a kiss…

122
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:20,750
Sorry if I'm a bit progressive,
but that was just…

123
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,000
I didn't feel wronged by that incident.

124
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,166
Do you feel wronged?

125
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,166
But what about other people?

126
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,458
What if my parents saw us?

127
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,833
What if Mr. Jody hears about this?

128
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,208
Did your parents see?

129
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,083
Jody also didn't hear about it.

130
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,458
Miss Adele.

131
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:12,583
Mr. Atmo. You came later than usual.

132
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,416
I overslept, miss.
Binge-watching Korean dramas.

133
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,291
Korean dramas? You like that too?

134
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:24,666
But I've learned my lesson.
I won't watch it again.

135
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,708
Why is that?

136
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,041
-You got it?
-Of course.

137
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,416
Excuse me. Hello?

138
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,791
You drakor?

139
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:38,625
Yes. I very very lazy drakor.

140
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,041
I watching drakor,

141
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:42,916
next, no sleep.

142
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,250
No. I watching drakor very very crazy,

143
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,625
kawanen.

144
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,750
Korean drama.

145
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,500
I like you… I like drakor.

146
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,791
-Thank you. Come back.
-Thank you.

147
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,750
Asyamnida.

148
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,208
-Go.
-Okay.

149
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,875
-Honey.
-Yes?

150
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,166
What is it?

151
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,166
When will Jody come back and pick up Anna?

152
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,041
I'm starting to worry.

153
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,833
Why would you worry?

154
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,833
Tarjo won't dare try something funny.

155
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,791
Besides, you're the one
who told Tarjo to accompany Anna.

156
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,625
Huh?

157
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,625
-So you're blaming me?
-Oh, come on!

158
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,916
If not Tarjo, then who?

159
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Me!

160
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,041
You're a flirt! I'd rather assign Partono.

161
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,125
Yes, ma'am?

162
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,041
Excuse me.

163
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,208
Um, Mr. Jarot's car is here.

164
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,000
I thought Sri was in Bandung.

165
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,125
Yes, but their car just parked here.

166
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,833
They're not coming out.

167
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,416
Well, just tell them to come out.

168
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,583
I feel uncomfortable doing that.

169
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,166
Looks like they're having a tiff.

170
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,083
Huh?

171
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,375
For God's sake.

172
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,875
If you take care of Menik by yourself,

173
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,041
not to mention
going here and there to sing,

174
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,458
it's definitely overwhelming.

175
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,958
Of course it's a lot of work.

176
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,041
Raising a child is always a lot of work.

177
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,958
But it's fine. I can handle it.

178
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,291
Really? Then why did Menik
get sick yesterday?

179
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,583
Kids get fevers all the time.

180
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,666
Whether there's one, two,
or even a bunch of caregivers,

181
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,750
she'll get sick
if her immune system is down.

182
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,333
Besides, we made a deal.

183
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,000
This marriage
will not interfere with our dreams.

184
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,166
We can still pursue them.

185
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,666
You know me.

186
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,791
I don't like the tradition of

187
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,250
the husband going to work

188
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,708
and the wife staying at home
with the kids.

189
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,250
I did agree to that deal.

190
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,291
And that's why I want us
to divide and conquer.

191
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,958
Then why are you pushing me
to make a choice?

192
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,250
Who told you to make a choice?

193
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,458
If you're asking me
to come to the Netherlands,

194
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,708
you're basically asking me to choose.

195
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,583
My job is here.

196
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,291
Go to sleep, sweetheart.

197
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:46,416
Why didn't you immediately accept
their offer yesterday?

198
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,791
They might think we're not interested.

199
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,750
We already discussed this at home.

200
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,958
Why do we have to argue about this now?

201
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,041
Because we must make a decision quickly.

202
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,416
I get that.

203
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,375
But not now.

204
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,708
Enough. I'm stressed.

205
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,250
-Let's go.
-Sweetheart.

206
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,333
Let's get out.

207
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,625
FOOD STALL & SOTO

208
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,125
PURE-HEARTED YOGYAKARTA

209
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,500
-No, no here.
-Wallet color?

210
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,875
No here.

211
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,916
Who took all my money?

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,333
This sucks!

213
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,375
Why?

214
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,875
It must've been a thief.

215
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,416
No. No "you sorry."

216
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,375
-Hey!
-Oh my gosh!

217
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,541
Why you walk alone?

218
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,208
Where you stay?

219
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,666
-My stay?
-Yes.

220
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,666
-Sunset Hotel?
-You know?

221
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,625
I first listen this hotel.

222
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,791
You and me searching this hotel.

223
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,750
Ubeng-ubeng. How do I say it?

224
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,916
You know? You can?

225
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,583
I know this. I help you.

226
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,208
-Gelem?
-Yes, okay.

227
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,083
Go.

228
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,708
SUNSET HOTEL
FOR RENT

229
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,000
What is this? It's closed!

230
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,125
-This ghost hotel.
-What?

231
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,208
Ghost everywhere.

232
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,291
This, lots of demit.

233
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,458
-You kena tipu.
-Sorry?

234
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,458
You dihipnotis.

235
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,791
Nggleleng.

236
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:16,583
You want my hotel?
I work to Mother Broto Guesthouse.

237
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,291
-Mother Broto Guesthouse?
-Yes. Wait.

238
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,750
Mother Broto's Guesthouse.

239
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,125
You go Mother Broto's Guesthouse?

240
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,458
-Your hand, this.
-Here?

241
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,625
Daripada jatuh.

242
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,375
Fine, then. Eat your nuggets first.

243
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,041
Make sure you eat a lot.

244
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,791
She's a good girl, eating her food.

245
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,666
Right, Menik?

246
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,500
Jarot.

247
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,250
Yes, Mom?

248
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,875
Is everything okay with you and Sri?

249
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,000
What do you mean?

250
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:44,125
The two of you were arguing
at the car park earlier.

251
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,500
That's nothing, Mom. It's common.

252
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,291
Well, don't make it a habit.

253
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,125
Everything okay with you?

254
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,958
Everything's fine, Dad.

255
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,125
Sri.

256
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:13,083
You've never seen
your mother and I fight, right?

257
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,833
It doesn't mean we never fight, you know.

258
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:27,083
But we both avoid fighting
in front of our children.

259
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,208
Think of Menik.

260
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,625
It's not good
if she sees her parents fight.

261
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,541
I understand, Dad.

262
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,291
Thank you for reminding me.

263
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,791
Besides, Jarot and I
are still adjusting and learning.

264
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,666
That's right. I've made mistakes,

265
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,041
your mother has made mistakes,

266
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,208
and we're both also still learning.

267
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,291
I understand
that you two have different personalities.

268
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,833
But whatever happens,

269
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:17,125
please try to always stay together.

270
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,916
That's the essence of being a family.

271
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,666
Yes, Mom.

272
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,125
I know that if I say this to Sri,

273
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,833
she will respond with,

274
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,083
"This is a different era, Mom."

275
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,791
"Every family
has their own ways and dynamics."

276
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,250
-Am I right?
-Yes.

277
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,333
However, I can impart my wisdom
based on my own experience.

278
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,541
And I think I can safely say
that my experience was a success.

279
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:51,333
Besides, I can't teach you ways
that I don't even understand.

280
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,291
What's up, Dad?

281
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,791
You seem restless.

282
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,250
Why is this?

283
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,333
Why?

284
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,041
Speak of the devil.

285
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,416
My stomach hurts.

286
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,375
Mr. Atmo.

287
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,625
-What is it, Yun?
-Come here.

288
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,916
Wait, sorry. Pause. Yes.

289
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,291
What is it, Yun?

290
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,791
You have to go
and buy something at the market.

291
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:45,125
-Why me? What about Urip?
-Mr. Urip is gone.

292
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,500
-May he rest in peace.
-No! I meant he's not here.

293
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,166
Mrs. Broto sent him on a task.

294
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,791
Yun, Mrs. Broto's Guesthouse
always provides personal touches.

295
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,333
Well, that's what I'm doing.

296
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,000
What personal touch?
You're only watching Korean dramas.

297
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,666
You've already finished the series.
I still have one more episode left.

298
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,000
Not my problem.

299
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,416
Fine, so you're refusing?
You don't want to go shopping?

300
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,916
-Want me to go instead?
-Yes.

301
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,333
Fine. Ma'am, Mr. Atmo refuses to go.

302
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,041
He'd rather watch Korean dramas.

303
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,583
Fine, I'll do it.

304
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:15,500
Thank you.

305
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:19,750
Ji Hae.

306
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:28,125
I no watching drakor with you,
but I go to market. Shopping.

307
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,500
Shopping?

308
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,208
Market tradisional.

309
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,208
DHARMA WIRATAMA MUSEUM

310
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,083
Ma'am.

311
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,875
-Bananas.
-Yes.

312
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,625
-What's this?
-Bananas.

313
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,000
-Ma'am.
-Hi there.

314
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,416
I'd like to buy eggplants.

315
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,416
-Monggo.
-Monggo.

316
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,333
Yes.

317
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,958
QRIS
UJANG FISH STALL

318
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:33,958
Fifteen thousand rupiahs. Thank you.

319
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,625
Please don't!

320
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,166
Don't!

321
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:51,333
Sorry, Sekar, I have to help out
at the guesthouse. Important business.

322
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,166
-Yes, Dad?
-Where are you rushing off to?

323
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:47,750
I have practice, Dad.

324
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,500
Bye, Dad.

325
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,041
Thank you.

326
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:06,750
At least now Menik has
a female role model who is

327
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:07,875
gentle.

328
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,666
What does that mean?

329
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,541
Sri often gets angry with Menik?

330
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,666
Not really. She's just more…

331
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,041
strict.

332
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,875
Strict or stern?

333
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,250
-Just strict.
-Stern or strict?

334
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,791
She's stern.

335
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,041
Never mind. I don't mean to vent.

336
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:35,750
That's okay, right?

337
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,541
They say the first five years of marriage

338
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:42,041
is the adjustment period.

339
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,125
-Is that so?
-I'm not sure, actually.

340
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,500
-Let's go.
-It's already dark, miss.

341
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,041
It's fine.
Might be important for my research.

342
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,458
Come on.

343
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,416
-It's starting to rain.
-Yeah.

344
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,666
Let's find shelter.

345
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,083
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

346
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,416
Okay, that's a wrap.

347
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:58,833
Mommy.

348
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:02,166
-Menik…
-Mommy!

349
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,375
Come on, let's play!

350
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,875
What's wrong, Menik?

351
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,333
-We don't know.
-Why are you crying, beautiful?

352
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,166
Mommy.

353
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,041
What's all this commotion? What's up?

354
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,875
-Ma'am…
-What is it, Menik?

355
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,666
What's wrong, sweetheart?

356
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,541
Don't be like that.

357
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,333
I don't like it
when you're being fussy like this.

358
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,791
That's enough. Let's go to our room.

359
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,541
Be patient, Sri. Calm down.

360
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:34,250
It's okay. Why don't you get some rest?
I'll take care of Menik.

361
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,125
-Menik, come here.
-Menik.

362
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,416
-That's enough.
-Sri.

363
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,708
Mom, Menik is my child.

364
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,416
Sri.

365
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,875
What's going on, Sri?

366
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,250
Menik is my child, Mom.

367
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,125
I have my own methods for raising her.

368
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,541
I know.

369
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,833
I understand that.

370
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,750
All of us here

371
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,791
are actually trying to support
your methods for raising her.

372
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:05,041
If you don't like how we do it,

373
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,541
just tell us what you want.

374
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,875
If you don't say anything,
we'll just assume

375
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:19,208
that what we're doing so far

376
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,166
is already working for you.

377
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,375
-Thanks, Mom.
-Don't mention it.

378
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,583
My poor Sri.

379
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:44,458
Be patient, okay?

380
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,125
Why are they like this, honey?

381
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,833
How come we clicked immediately
during our early years?

382
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,208
-We did?
-Yes, we did.

383
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:08,083
Well, at the very least, we were like

384
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,166
a pair of sandals.

385
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,333
-Sandals?
-Yes. Left and right.

386
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:17,250
Walking together,
heading towards a common goal.

387
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,166
Right?

388
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,791
On the contrary, those two

389
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:24,000
are like bicycle wheels.

390
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,875
The front and back wheel.

391
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,500
They have a common goal,

392
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,708
but always chasing each other,
never meeting.

393
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:35,708
The bicycle will fall over
if the wheels meet, honey.

394
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,833
That's the problem, honey.
They never click.

395
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,833
Right?

396
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,250
It's so strange, Jo.

397
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,458
I know nothing about the essence, but

398
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,250
I feel

399
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,583
like I belong. I feel entranced.

400
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,625
Yeah. I thought
you only wanted to drop by.

401
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,750
Or that maybe you'll get sleepy
and suggest leaving.

402
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,708
-Who knew you'd stay till the end?
-I loved it.

403
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,958
I could feel it in the audience.

404
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,083
Their energy
merged with the dancers' energy.

405
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:26,958
Hungry?

406
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:29,958
Starving! I'm famished!

407
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,000
We forgot all about dinner.

408
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,500
All right. Let's get gudeg.

409
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,625
The only one still available at this hour.

410
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:37,458
What if I just cook?

411
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,750
Let's head back to the guesthouse,
and I'll cook.

412
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:43,541
-Come on.
-Yeah.

413
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,333
Here.

414
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:53,125
You're about to taste
the best fried rice in Southeast Asia.

415
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:01,250
You mean the fried rice
in Korea and Japan is tastier?

416
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,333
Fine. The best in the world.

417
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,125
I'm surprised

418
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:26,416
that a woman like you can cook.

419
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,916
A woman like me? Meaning?

420
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,375
I mean,

421
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,208
a beautiful,

422
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:37,416
intelligent…

423
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,250
and

424
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,458
busy woman

425
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,750
who never smells of spices.

426
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,541
I'm actually an excellent cook.

427
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,875
However, ever since I got married,

428
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:55,416
Jody hasn't really cared for my cooking.

429
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,375
So I figured, "Why bother?"

430
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:02,833
Okay.

431
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,625
Try it.

432
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,541
-Try it. Can you cook?
-Me?

433
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,083
-Try it.
-What should I do?

434
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,500
Add some oyster sauce.

435
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,791
Just like that.

436
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,583
Like holding a spoon.

437
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,583
There you go.

438
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,583
This will take forever to mix.

439
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,875
-I spilled some.
-You're making a mess.

440
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,875
-Let me do it.
-Taste it first.

441
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:15,333
-Is it good?
-Why don't you try it yourself?

442
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,666
-Best in the world?
-In the world!

443
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,041
-Good, huh?
-It's delicious.
