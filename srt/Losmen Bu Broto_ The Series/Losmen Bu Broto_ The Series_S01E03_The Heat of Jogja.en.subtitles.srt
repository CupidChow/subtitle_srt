1
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,250
Miss Pur, the oyster sauce is down here.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,250
Why is it there? You must've misplaced it.

3
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,333
I told you,
all spices have their own place.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,875
-It wasn't me, miss.
-Then who?

5
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,916
What… Why are there eggshells here?

6
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,625
Pass me the trash can.

7
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,416
Where is it? It's not here.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,708
Here it is, miss.
Found it all the way there.

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,666
Why was it there? Put it here.

10
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,583
Darn it!

11
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,125
I asked you to put this in the sink.

12
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,166
What a mess.

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,875
We have to write notes tomorrow
to avoid mixing them up.

14
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:46,541
What is it, Mo?

15
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,166
Jody, I'm surprised
you're calling this early.

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,291
Today is Anna's birthday.

17
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,250
Her birthday?

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,083
-Really?
-But don't tell anyone.

19
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,791
-And?
-I'm coming to Yogyakarta to surprise her.

20
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,083
Your wife will be pleased.

21
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,958
What time do you think you'll arrive?

22
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,416
About 8:00 p.m. tonight.

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,625
May I ask for a favor?

24
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,208
Of course you may.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,333
What is it?

26
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,791
-A party?
-Yes, a party.

27
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,708
Can we manage?

28
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,208
How will we prepare for it?

29
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,583
Food, entertainment…

30
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:33,583
No big deal, just take care of it.

31
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,583
What do you mean "just take care of it"?
No big deal?

32
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:40,583
Pur will help, or someone else.
It won't take long, honey.

33
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,708
What I mean is, this could help

34
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,583
rebuild Jody and Anna's relationship.

35
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,500
I feel sorry for them, honey.

36
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,666
-Fine.
-You can do it, right?

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,541
-Please, honey--
-Fine!

38
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,125
But Anna is here at the guesthouse, honey.

39
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,916
What if she sees us?

40
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,375
Right.

41
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,791
Well…

42
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,625
We'll ask Partono

43
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,916
to take Anna around.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,875
When she comes, the party will be ready.

45
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,375
You got this?

46
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,625
Of course you got it.

47
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,583
Right?

48
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,958
-Wait a minute. I'll check with Partono.
-Sure.

49
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,708
Mrs. Broto is definitely the best.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,208
LOSMEN BU BROTO: THE SERIES

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,333
-Morning, Miss Anna.
-Morning.

52
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,458
Mr. Gito.

53
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,500
Good morning, Mr. Broto.

54
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,458
Good morning.

55
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,375
-Have you had breakfast? Good.
-Yes, I have.

56
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,541
-Don't tire yourself out.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,708
Anna.

58
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:47,375
-Morning, Mr. Broto.
-Good morning.

59
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:52,125
-Just returned from your morning walk?
-Yes, just to stretch my legs.

60
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,875
I bought this on my way home.

61
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,750
Gudeg porridge.

62
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,541
Yogyakarta's signature dish.

63
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,958
Delicious.

64
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,583
Let's have breakfast.

65
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,541
Just eat this instead.
You'll definitely like it. Come.

66
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,750
WELCOME

67
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:22,583
I bet you like inviting your guests
to come and eat this gudeg porridge.

68
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,833
Of course.

69
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,791
Everybody likes it.

70
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,333
Especially Jody.

71
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,250
This is his favorite dish.

72
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,708
He never told you that?

73
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,500
No. Maybe he was too busy.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,250
I guess so.

75
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,541
But your husband is a kind man.

76
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,791
He was the one who helped this guesthouse
when we had financial troubles.

77
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,916
He's a great person.

78
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,416
Anna.

79
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,875
Any plans for this afternoon?

80
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,583
Let's get going, Menik.

81
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,166
Where's your jacket?

82
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,083
-Don't forget her jacket.
-I'm just about to put it on her.

83
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,041
-Right arm first…
-Not that one.

84
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,000
She needs a thicker jacket.

85
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,750
This is the one she usually wears.

86
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:25,958
Here.

87
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,750
-Wear this one.
-Okay.

88
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:34,666
Here you go. Menik,
you'll spend the day with Daddy today.

89
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,125
I want to create a song for you.

90
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,833
You can listen to it once I'm finished.

91
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay?

92
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,916
My beautiful girl.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,750
Right, who's ready to go to the guest…

94
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,666
…house.

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,291
-And play with Auntie…
-…Pur.

96
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,750
Right!

97
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,125
-Let's go.
-Bye, sweetheart.

98
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,875
-Take care, honey.
-All right.

99
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,666
Is this tripod damaged?

100
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,375
Give it to me.

101
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,000
Give it to me. I'll do it.

102
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,083
You don't have to, Yun.
Do you even know how to record?

103
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,791
I became a Korean fan way before you did.

104
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,708
Fine.

105
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,416
Right, where will you be?

106
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,833
I want leaves in the background.
So I'll stand here.

107
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,291
Move to the left.

108
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,333
-Here?
-Yes.

109
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,250
-To the left, move it!
-Here?

110
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,041
-Got it.
-You know the song, right?

111
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,000
-Left.
-Okay.

112
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,166
One, two--

113
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,000
Wait… I join with you.

114
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,833
I join with you.

115
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,708
I am tambahkan, then…

116
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,041
perfect dan.

117
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,166
-Okay.
-She understands, Yun.

118
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,416
Wait.

119
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,083
Aba-aba, ready?

120
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,125
-Aba-aba with me, yes?
-Yeah.

121
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,416
Up.

122
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,583
Thanks.

123
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,166
What do you think?

124
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,250
DECIDE WHERE YOU'RE GOING

125
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,166
I'm not good at designing, miss.

126
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,708
You don't have to do everything yourself.

127
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,625
If you want,

128
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,583
I can contact my design partner,
who usually deals with books.

129
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,333
-Would you like that?
-Sure.

130
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,666
Okay.

131
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,875
Was I too honest? I'm sorry.

132
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,291
It's okay, miss.

133
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,500
I actually need this kind of honesty.

134
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,875
I don't really get that
from people around me.

135
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,958
So you don't mind
if I speak bluntly like this?

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You mean, there's something else
that you're not honest with me about?

137
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,125
This is my personal opinion.

138
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:48,625
You and your partner… What's her name?

139
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,291
-Sekar.
-Yes, Sekar.

140
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,541
Your portions are too similar.

141
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,208
You have the same values. Both are good.

142
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,000
In other words,
you're not completing each other.

143
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,708
There's still room for development,

144
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:10,166
but at some point, there's a real risk

145
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,416
of feeling stuck.

146
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,333
Mr. Par, can you do me a favor?

147
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,750
-What favor, miss?
-Come here.

148
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,666
Well?

149
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,375
-Hold on.
-It's okay, miss.

150
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:03,875
Drink this.

151
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,416
Is it horrible?

152
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,958
It's delicious, miss.

153
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,875
So good that I don't want to swallow.
I just want to keep chewing.

154
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:19,541
You startled me.

155
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,208
My gosh…

156
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,375
the romance here is like in Korean dramas.

157
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,916
You watch too many Korean dramas.

158
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,125
Not too many, Miss Pur. Just too often.

159
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,791
Miss, I'll see you later.

160
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,541
Miss Pur…

161
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,833
thanks for the fried rice.

162
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,916
Here you go, miss.

163
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,875
Miss Pur, fried rice
is Mr. Partono's favorite dish.

164
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:10,958
Is that so?

165
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,791
His wife was also an amazing cook.

166
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,750
Just maybe,

167
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,833
you remind him of his late wife, miss.

168
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,000
Is that so?

169
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,083
Anything else, Mo?

170
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,916
To tell the truth, miss,
I know who made a mess in the kitchen.

171
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,958
It doesn't matter.
Everything is back in its place.

172
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,625
No, it's…

173
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:48,958
It's not that. I mean,
I saw it with my own eyes, miss. I swear.

174
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,125
Saw what?

175
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,250
I saw Mr. Tarjo and Miss Anna,
late at night--

176
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,666
Huh? What did you say?

177
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,291
I saw Mr. Tarjo and Miss Anna cooking
late at night.

178
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,708
That's fine. It was Tarjo, right?

179
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,666
Besides, it's not messy anymore.

180
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,000
How should I put this?

181
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,625
But they were cooking differently.

182
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,333
-Like this, miss.
-Hey!

183
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,916
I'll smack you with this!

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,916
Well, that's what I meant.

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,958
They looked…

186
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,208
Intimate. At least,
that's what it looked like.

187
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,250
Enough. Don't jump to conclusions.

188
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,708
They're just friends.

189
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,958
Like you and your Korean customer.

190
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,791
Right.

191
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,083
All right. If you need anything,
just call for me.

192
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,041
Okay.

193
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,583
Keep going.

194
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:42,916
Forward.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,083
Stop!

196
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,208
-Welcome.
-Yes.

197
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,333
This is interesting.

198
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,250
Welcome to Mother Broto's Guesthouse.

199
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,291
Broto. Good morning.

200
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,333
Are you check out?

201
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:17,708
No. Maksud saya, are you check in?

202
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,041
How do I say it?

203
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,291
Oppa!

204
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,000
-Ji Hae!
-Oppa!

205
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,291
Long time no see!

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,875
-Oppa, when did you arrive?
-Just now.

207
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,791
-You just arrived?
-Yes.

208
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,916
Atmo, come.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,333
This is Oppa Jinbin.

210
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,500
-This is Atmo, my friend.
-Friend?

211
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:40,916
Hello.

212
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,291
Are you tired?
Or should we leave straight away?

213
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,708
I'm fine.

214
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:51,041
I wanted to spend time with you,
and I've also prepared an itinerary.

215
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,208
In that case, let's go right now.

216
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,416
-Atmo, see you later!
-Bye!

217
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,833
-Hooray! There's a place I like.
-Really?

218
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,000
-Is that so?
-But I'm starving.

219
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,000
-You're hungry?
-I want to eat.

220
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,291
-Okay.
-What do you say?

221
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,125
-Sure.
-Great. Let's go!

222
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,208
-Are you happy?
-Yeah.

223
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,208
Since when do you like chocolate?

224
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,291
-Since I was four.
-Four years old?

225
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,750
Really?

226
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,166
How could I not know?

227
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,791
Menik.

228
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,000
-Let's take a look inside, okay?
-Let's go.

229
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:45,333
Hi, sweetheart. Are you Menik?

230
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,208
Menik, do you want to play there?
I'll take you.

231
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,083
-What is it?
-I want to play with you, Dad.

232
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,583
All right. Let's go.

233
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,208
Yay!

234
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,208
Why don't you make me an ice cream?

235
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,666
Can you do it? Here.

236
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,583
There you go.

237
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,916
Here, eat it.

238
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,208
Want some?

239
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,875
No? All right.

240
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,958
Miss, let's start the trial period today.

241
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,625
It looks like she's amenable.

242
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,166
Sure. That's fine, sir.

243
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:44,250
Please provide your ID card
and a contact number for emergencies.

244
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,250
Sure. Can we do it over there?

245
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Daddy!

246
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,083
I want to stay with you!

247
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,125
Hello, honey?

248
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,208
What?

249
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,541
Huh? Why is Menik there?

250
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,625
For God's sake.

251
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,291
Are you kidding me?

252
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,791
What on earth were you thinking?

253
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,208
-Chin up, Sugeng.
-Sure thing.

254
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,416
-Mr. Par.
-What is it, Yun?

255
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,416
Please pick up our guests
from Malioboro at 1:00 p.m.

256
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,458
They're going to go
to Magelang afterwards.

257
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,375
All right.

258
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,125
Who are the guests?

259
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,791
Ji Hae and her boyfriend.

260
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,125
How do you know they're dating?

261
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,666
Didn't you see them?
They were so intimate.

262
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,458
Holding hands--

263
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,166
Does it automatically mean dating?

264
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,666
In Korean culture,
holding hands and using the term "oppa"--

265
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,041
Does that equal dating?

266
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,125
In Korean dramas, yes.

267
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,916
You should watch them.
No doubt, they're definitely dating.

268
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,791
-It's hot here. I'm leaving.
-Where are you going? I'll come.

269
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,208
No. I need some alone time.

270
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,000
-What about me?
-I said alone.

271
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,125
That's not what I meant.

272
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,250
If you're leaving,
why are you taking those towels?

273
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,875
There you go.

274
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,958
Yun, that was mean.

275
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,458
He started it.

276
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,083
Sorry, miss. You can have it.

277
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,750
Okay.

278
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,000
Jo.

279
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,708
-Yeah, Mom?
-Can you come here?

280
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,500
Afternoon, Mrs. Broto.

281
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,250
Good afternoon, Anna.

282
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,708
What is it, Mom?

283
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,458
Today is Anna's birthday.

284
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,541
Really? Why didn't she tell me?

285
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,333
Don't congratulate her yet.

286
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:31,083
Mr. Jody is preparing a surprise for her.

287
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:37,458
Your father said
this is very important for their marriage.

288
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:43,166
To keep Anna in the dark,
ask Partono to take her around the city.

289
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,250
All right.

290
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,041
Hi, Jo.

291
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,666
Why is the TWS web design different
from the one I sent yesterday?

292
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,375
Who made this one?

293
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,083
If the head of tourism, Mr. Dodi,
sees this, he'll get confused.

294
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,750
He'll assume this is a new proposal.

295
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,708
Hello?

296
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,083
Tarjo, you there?

297
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,000
Sekar, this is Anna.

298
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,791
-Oh, hi.
-There was no water in Tarjo's bathroom.

299
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,416
So he took a shower in my room.

300
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm just realizing now
that he left his phone here.

301
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,125
That's okay, miss.
Please just tell him that I called.

302
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,375
-Thanks.
-Okay.

303
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,250
How could you make
a decision like that by yourself?

304
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,416
I just want to ease the transition
for Menik when we move to the Netherlands.

305
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,333
Honey.

306
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,375
This is about
you making a decision by yourself.

307
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,500
Even though we agreed
to discuss everything together.

308
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,125
But we have to start preparing from now.

309
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,041
That's not the point.

310
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,541
The point is,
you made a decision by yourself.

311
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,250
Without involving me.

312
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,041
And not just me. This concerns Menik too.

313
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,291
-What if she got traumatized?
-Fine, I was wrong.

314
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,166
I made a mistake.

315
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,041
I need to ask you a favor.

316
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,666
Take Menik to the guesthouse.
I have an appointment.

317
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,166
Fine. We'll go to the guesthouse.

318
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,500
This is so typical of you.

319
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,166
You promise one thing
and do another thing.

320
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,291
Happy birthday, girl.

321
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,000
Congratulations! You're the first one
to wish me that.

322
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,458
Huh? Seriously?

323
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,958
What about Jody? Is he insane?

324
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,541
Forget about saying happy birthday.
I don't think he even remembers.

325
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,666
It's not like I expect anything.

326
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,750
Poor you!

327
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,916
If you were in Jakarta right now,
I'd definitely kidnap you.

328
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,416
We'll go partying, girl.

329
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,791
What are we, teenage girls?

330
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,000
We may be older.

331
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,625
-But we have boy toys, girl.
-You're insane!

332
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,416
So you don't have any plans for today?

333
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,958
Just staying in your room?

334
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,291
Jo, let's go out.

335
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,833
I can't drive you around today, miss.
Mr. Partono will take you.

336
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,750
-Can you do that?
-Oh.

337
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,833
I'm scheduled to take another customer.

338
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,375
Why don't you drive her?

339
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,583
Oh no.

340
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,083
I have to go. Don't want to be late.

341
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,458
See you both later.

342
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,833
Let's go.

343
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,375
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

344
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,166
It's not suitable, Mo.

345
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,416
-Take it down.
-Why, sir?

346
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,750
It's a surprise birthday party!
Why do we need a banner? Are you crazy?

347
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,875
What? Take it down.

348
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:50,708
Good grief.

349
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,250
-Miss, can you scoot over to him?
-Get closer?

350
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,833
-Like this?
-Yes.

351
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,250
A bit to the right.

352
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,666
Be careful. Put it there.

353
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,583
Well, honey? Where is he?

354
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:13,125
-He's not answering.
-Oh no. The party is about to start.

355
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,875
Sir. Ma'am. Here is the cake.

356
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,166
Let's take a look.

357
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,416
-This is nice.
-It's pretty.

358
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,791
Atmo!

359
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,541
Atmo.

360
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,083
-Good.
-Right?

361
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,916
-Are you happy? Good.
-Yes.

362
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,833
-You happy?
-Yeah, I'm happy.

363
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,916
-There is a party?
-Yes.

364
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:24,500
I'm going to take a shower,
change my clothes, then come to the party.

365
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,875
-Okay?
-Okay.

366
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,583
Okay, see you later! Bye!

367
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,416
Bye, Atmo.

368
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,250
Partono.

369
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,916
Now tell me, what did they do all day?

370
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:45,708
What's with you?

371
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:48,333
I was assigned as their tour guide.

372
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,416
Assigned to drive them, accompany them,
and stand by in case they need me.

373
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,333
How could you not see anything?

374
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,083
See what exactly?

375
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,833
What are you implying?

376
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,333
They're a couple.
You didn't see them being intimate?

377
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,625
-What do you mean?
-Cut the crap.

378
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:11,583
Just be honest with me.
What did they do all day?

379
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,750
Atmo, don't you believe me?

380
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,708
I only saw them talking to each other,

381
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,208
sleeping together…

382
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:22,958
I mean,

383
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,583
sleeping together in the car
because they were tired.

384
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,041
I do believe. I believe you're lying.

385
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,291
Why did you come back here?

386
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,958
What would you like to eat?

387
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:52,250
Miss Pur,
got any leftover fried rice from earlier?

388
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,416
Sure.

389
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:55,750
Go ahead and eat it.

390
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,333
Here you go.

391
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:04,250
You really love fried rice, huh?

392
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:05,666
Yes, I do, miss.

393
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,500
When I'm feeling homesick,
I usually crave fried rice.

394
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,958
Homemade fried rice is the best!

395
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,208
Please enjoy.

396
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,041
-I'm going to eat now, miss.
-Sure.

397
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,333
-Are you waiting for a call?
-Yes, from Menik.

398
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,125
She said she would call again.

399
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:33,000
She gets annoyed
if I don't answer when she calls.

400
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,125
She tends to be sensitive
when she misses me.

401
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,083
The heart wants what the heart wants.

402
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:42,000
…to gather around.

403
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,333
Please join us. Thank you.

404
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,083
Thank you.

405
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,875
So exciting!
Isn't this nice? Look at that.

406
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,458
For God's sake, honey.

407
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,000
We've been waiting for a while.

408
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,666
-Still no luck?
-Damn.

409
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,000
-Wait.
-There it is.

410
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,541
-Here he is.
-Answer it.

411
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,958
Jody, where are you now?

412
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:16,333
Here.

413
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,875
-Do I hear music?
-Maybe there's an event.

414
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,250
That's unusual.

415
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,000
He says he can't come.

416
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,041
So what about the party?

417
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:36,083
He wants us to make sure
Anna knows this party was Jody's idea.

418
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:40,000
-What was he thinking?
-Well, that's what he said.

419
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,583
We went to all this trouble for him…

420
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:45,000
-We prepared a party, but now…
-I know.

421
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,625
There's Anna.

422
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,625
She's with Tarjo.

423
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,041
-Everything is ready.
-Let's go.

424
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,541
Make sure everything is in its place.

425
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,166
-Thank you.
-Get some matches.

426
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,083
The matches.

427
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,250
Please come in, miss.

428
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,583
-Want one?
-No, thanks.

429
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,458
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MISS ANNA

430
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:23,791
What's this?

431
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:31,083
We'll pray for you

432
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:35,250
We wish you prosperity

433
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:39,416
And good health

434
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,625
We wish you a long life

435
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:47,500
And happiness

436
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:52,541
-Happy birthday, Anna.
-Happy birthday, Anna.

437
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,166
My gosh. All this for me?

438
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,958
Yes. A surprise party for you.

439
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,791
-Yes, from--
-From Jody.

440
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,291
Yes, this is from Jody.

441
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,250
-Blow out the candles.
-Yes.

442
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,458
All right.

443
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,083
-Happy birthday!
-Congratulations!

444
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,916
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

445
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,500
Go ahead and cut the cake.

446
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:58,166
Mrs. Broto, thank you
for accepting me like family here.

447
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,000
Thank you.

448
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,791
Happy birthday, miss. Yun.

449
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,416
No, Jin Bin is not my boyfriend.

450
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:22,708
Oppa Jin Bin is my senior,
and he lives in Indonesia.

451
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,625
But you say "oppa," Ji Hae.

452
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,500
The term "oppa"
is not only for a boyfriend.

453
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,791
We use it for close male friends too.

454
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:48,958
Thank you, Oma.

455
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,375
Atmo is oppa number one.

456
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,916
-I really?
-Yes.

457
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,833
Atmo number Ji Hae oppa?

458
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,166
"Oppa." Number one Ji Hae oppa.

459
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,833
You believe magic?

460
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,625
Yes. Where's magic?

461
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:25,791
I have magic with you.

462
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,000
-Really? Where?
-Look.

463
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,125
Nothing.

464
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,208
Thank you, Oppa.

465
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,583
Siomai, capcai.

466
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,666
I'm going to get some drinks.

467
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,666
We have a meeting
with the Office of Tourism tomorrow.

468
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,916
Why did you suddenly change
the TWS web design, Jo?

469
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,125
It looks better, right?

470
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:32,750
That's not what I asked.

471
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,541
TWS is our project.

472
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,125
I can't do everything on my own.

473
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,500
BASED ON LOSMEN, THE TV SERIES

474
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:34,208
