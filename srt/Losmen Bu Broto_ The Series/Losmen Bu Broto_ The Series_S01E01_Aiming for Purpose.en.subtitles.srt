00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,500
MRS. BROTO'S GUESTHOUSE

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,500
WELCOME

4
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,625
Welcome to Mrs. Broto's guesthouse.

5
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,916
Please. Welcome.

6
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,625
Go ahead, boys and girls.

7
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,666
Please come in.

8
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:00,833
I bought this chicken porridge for you.
It's currently popular in Yogyakarta.

9
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,875
-Is that so?
-The lines are long.

10
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,625
-Really?
-It was packed!

11
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,333
But I bet
your porridge tastes better, Pur.

12
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:12,666
Nowadays, it's all about the packaging
and the sensation, Mom.

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,041
As long as it's viral,
the taste will follow.

14
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,250
The product is porridge, isn't it?

15
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,625
It's not for eating, Mom.

16
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,000
It's for content.

17
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,541
There's a note.

18
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:28,541
"To Mr. Broto,
please enjoy this warm porridge from us."

19
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,833
"Mr. Broto." Do you know this person?

20
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:37,375
Of course not. I just introduced…
I mean, they asked my name

21
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,375
for that note.

22
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,708
To write a message.

23
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,791
It's the current marketing strategy, Mom.

24
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,333
It adds a personal touch.

25
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,208
Mrs. Broto's Guesthouse has provided

26
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,708
personal touches for ages. Right?

27
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,500
-Right.
-Maybe so, Mom.

28
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,916
But it has to be integrated into a system.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,541
Starting from guest arrival
until departure.

30
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:03,750
That's why I created software
for our guests' database.

31
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,666
-Yes, Mo?
-Excuse me.

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,958
Miss Pur, is it true
that we have a group arrival today?

33
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,458
Yes. The archery youngsters
from Surabaya, right?

34
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,000
Have they arrived?

35
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,125
Not that one.

36
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,875
There's a group of 20 women from Semarang.

37
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,291
And they want to check in right now?

38
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,375
Twenty. Do we have enough rooms?

39
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,875
Honey, come here.

40
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,833
Oh no, there's a lot of them.

41
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,541
What should we do?

42
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,708
Hold them off while we prepare the rooms.

43
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,250
Hurry. There's Tarjo.

44
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,208
Honey, calm down. You hold them off first.

45
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,708
I'll handle things inside.

46
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,208
-It's okay.
-It's fine.

47
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,458
Welcome to the guesthouse, boys and girls.

48
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,333
How was the trip?

49
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,666
-Are you tired?
-No.

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,916
How could you let this happen?

51
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,500
But I already arranged it
in the system, Dad.

52
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,375
To hell with your system!

53
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,625
Just fix this!

54
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,666
What were you thinking?

55
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,250
Jo? Tarjo!

56
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,166
Now what?

57
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,958
Why on earth did you change the system?

58
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,416
For efficiency, Mom. Look.

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,000
You're confused, right?

60
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,333
I'm still getting used to it.

61
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,750
This is a good system.

62
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,958
What do you mean "good"?

63
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,791
We are all used to the system
created by Sri.

64
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,000
Mom, Sri doesn't even live here anymore.

65
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,208
We have to adjust.

66
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,625
Why are you still depending on her?

67
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,458
I've always said
if the system works, don't mess with it.

68
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,875
Never mind that.
Let's just find a solution.

69
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,208
Pur, how many rooms are left?

70
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,166
Count.

71
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,291
Grandma.

72
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,750
Menik.

73
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,541
There's a lot of commotion outside.
Atmo already told me.

74
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,166
We still have two more rooms.

75
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,625
Pur and Tarjo's rooms. We can use them.

76
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,916
Fine, do that.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,875
No.

78
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,458
Just provide extra beds
so we'll have four triple rooms.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,666
Offer a 50% discount on that.

80
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,666
We can avoid any problems that way.

81
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,916
I agree with that.

82
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,416
Yeah, that could work.

83
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,416
"That could work." This is all your fault.

84
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,791
Pur, let's get ready.

85
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,333
Menik, come with Auntie Pur.

86
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,375
You've gained weight, huh?

87
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,125
Why did you mess with my system, Jo?

88
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,916
I was just polishing it.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,125
Your system wasn't efficient.

90
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,250
This is a guesthouse,
not your school project.

91
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,333
There's a difference.

92
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,125
Why are you blaming me?

93
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,083
This entire mess
is because of what you did, right?

94
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,708
What exactly are you saying?

95
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,333
-That's the truth.
-Enough!

96
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,333
What's the big deal?

97
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,041
Just return it back to normal,
and we're done.

98
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,375
Piece of cake.

99
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,125
There's no need to fight.

100
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,958
Sri, go and help your mother.

101
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,125
Jo.

102
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,666
You are my only son.

103
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,541
It's time you learn responsibility!

104
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,500
My name is Mrs. Broto,

105
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,041
owner and founder of this guesthouse.

106
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,333
I'm assisted by my husband,

107
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:12,666
a man who is always supportive
and serves our guests cordially.

108
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,208
Our firstborn, Pur,

109
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:22,416
is the top cook at our guesthouse,
with an unforgettable signature dish.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,125
Our second child, Sri,

111
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:30,000
is a talented musician
with an astounding voice

112
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,916
and a wonderful mother
to her daughter, Menik.

113
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,250
The last one is Tarjo,

114
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,583
our youngest son,

115
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,166
currently striving to obtain
a bachelor's degree,

116
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,875
the first in our family.

117
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,125
This is the family story

118
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,833
of Mrs. Broto's Guesthouse.

119
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,666
That's it. Forward.

120
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,250
Stop!

121
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,958
What the…

122
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,791
Jody, you finally made it.

123
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,666
Welcome.

124
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,791
-How are you?
-At long last.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,208
-It's been so long.
-Yes.

126
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:22,208
Yes, after so many delays,
I finally made it here.

127
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,833
Thank God.

128
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,541
So you don't forget.

129
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,666
-This is Anna.
-Anna.

130
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,875
I'm Anna, Mr. Broto.

131
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,875
This is Anna?

132
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,958
Wow, you've gotten prettier.

133
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:39,500
Thank you. Jody often tells me stories
about this place.

134
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,500
I hope it's all good stories.

135
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,416
Don't you dare mess with me.

136
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,583
-Let's go inside. Come.
-Sure.

137
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,500
Come.

138
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:53,041
Jody, was it your wife's idea
to come to Yogyakarta?

139
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,375
It was ours.

140
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,875
That's good to hear.

141
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,958
Want to see the room first
or have a cup of coffee?

142
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,875
-Coffee sounds good.
-All right.

143
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,375
Is it okay if I head to our room?

144
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,250
Of course.

145
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,208
-Yun?
-Yes, sir?

146
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,333
-Please take Mrs. Anna to her room.
-Will do.

147
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,250
-Let's go.
-This way.

148
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,291
-Go ahead, Mo.
-Yes.

149
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,333
Yes, sir.

150
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,541
The main goal
of the "Traveling with Strangers" program

151
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,916
is cultural exchange, ma'am,

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,125
and it's more personal.

153
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,583
I get it.

154
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,583
A business with a personal approach
is definitely good,

155
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,250
but profit is a must.

156
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,708
So I'll be expecting
your financial projection.

157
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,583
If you fail to pass this class,

158
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,500
you risk expulsion.

159
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,416
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,375
It's always wrong.

161
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,583
Looks like you're in for another revision.

162
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,208
Yeah.

163
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,041
Have a drink, Jo.

164
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,625
It's fresh.

165
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,625
Thanks.

166
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,208
Which chapter needs to be revised again?

167
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,208
Financing plan.

168
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,166
I'll help you.

169
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,416
It's okay, Jo.

170
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
No need to be sad. It's just a revision.

171
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,500
You might as well give up.

172
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,458
Lots of successful people
didn't finish college.

173
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,291
JAVANESE ETHNOLOGY

174
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:01,875
I'm leaving now.

175
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,833
Where are you going, Jo?

176
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,208
I don't know. Just to walk around.

177
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,583
-Bye.
-Bye.

178
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,208
Right, Jody?

179
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,708
-Please drink.
-Yes.

180
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,333
Match your stance. Okay, kids.

181
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:32,083
We will practice the first,
second, and third positions.

182
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,625
Leon, pay attention.

183
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,833
We're here.

184
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,833
Thanks for today, Mr. Partono.

185
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't forget
our appointment tomorrow for--

186
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,250
Klatak satay.

187
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,333
Don't forget, okay?

188
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,500
-Thanks.
-No problem.

189
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,583
He's our best driver so far.

190
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,875
Good evening, Jody, Anna.

191
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm sorry I didn't greet you earlier.

192
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,666
Not a problem, Mrs. Broto.

193
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes. This is Pur, my eldest daughter.
Do you remember her?

194
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,541
Sure, the future manager
of this guesthouse, right,

195
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,833
since Sri is going to pursue singing.

196
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,333
How do you like your room, Anna?

197
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:35,500
It's very comfy.
No wonder Jody always wants to stay here.

198
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,583
I see.

199
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,791
I hope you enjoy your stay.

200
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,541
Of course. We want to try your cooking.

201
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:46,250
Well, tonight is perfect
for tasting Pur's cooking.

202
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,166
-Right.
-Please.

203
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,583
Go ahead.
There should be a table over there.

204
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,000
-We'll bring your food.
-Thank you.

205
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,083
Go ahead.

206
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,791
Mom, is that the Jody who helped us
when the guesthouse almost closed down?

207
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,750
Mm-hmm.

208
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:06,375
Anna is his second wife.
His first wife passed away.

209
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,250
Go prepare their food.

210
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,333
Sure.

211
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,583
Why haven't you finished your book?

212
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,000
ROBERT SAMUDRA
INCOMING CALL

213
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,166
I thought you said no interruptions.

214
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,708
Just for urgent matters.

215
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,166
This might be important.

216
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,708
Hello? Yes?

217
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,875
How's it going, sir?

218
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,041
Go back to Jakarta?

219
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,125
Sure. I can do that.

220
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,833
-Sorry.
-It's okay. I'm the one who's intruding.

221
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:47,791
Here to check in?

222
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,625
I'll get someone.

223
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,791
No need. I'm Tarjo,

224
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,333
Mr. and Mrs. Broto's youngest son.

225
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,416
I'm Anna, a guest here.

226
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,208
My mistake.

227
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:02,916
What kind of mistake?

228
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:08,166
Never mind.
They mentioned someone named Tarjo.

229
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,333
I assumed Tarjo…

230
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,583
Sounds majestic, huh?

231
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,416
Big dude, long hair.

232
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,541
Tattoos. Formidable looking, right?

233
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,666
As it turns out…

234
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,583
-Yes?
-Well, turns out…

235
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,541
You're like this.

236
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,333
Meaning?

237
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,625
So you're a writer.

238
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,750
I was.

239
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,791
I'm currently on a break.

240
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,875
What did you write about?

241
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,333
It's not important, Jo.

242
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,416
Really? I don't believe that.

243
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,125
If you don't mind, may I know?

244
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:54,291
I wrote about women in their thirties.

245
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,000
You know. It's so cliché.

246
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,416
And what's wrong with that?

247
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,791
I like cliché.

248
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,208
But it doesn't sell well.

249
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,458
Does it have to?

250
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:10,458
Based on my observation,
I don't think you write to sell.

251
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,625
Know-it-all.

252
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,708
Listen.

253
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,083
So,

254
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,125
I'm having the same problem.

255
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,500
I'm working on my thesis,

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,875
but I have to create
a marketable paradigm.

257
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,041
I'm at a dead end.

258
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,291
Oversharing.

259
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,125
So what are you writing right now?

260
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Stuff I know.

261
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,916
Marriage, Javanese culture.

262
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,791
But as I said before,

263
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,083
I just realized

264
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:00,458
that I'm a Javanese
who knows nothing about Javanese culture.

265
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,416
What should I do?

266
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,541
Perfect timing.
You can do research in Yogyakarta.

267
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,291
May I read it?

268
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:09,875
Don't. It sucks.

269
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,208
Understandable. It's a work in progress.

270
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,750
Don't laugh if it sucks.

271
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,041
I won't.

272
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,375
-I'm going back now.
-Okay.

273
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,291
Hello, sir.

274
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,208
That's right.

275
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,750
Jody had to return abruptly to Jakarta

276
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,416
despite my initial plans
for vacationing here.

277
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,083
So I decided to stay behind.

278
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,000
That's a good idea. Here he is.

279
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,000
Here he is.

280
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,000
I haven't introduced him.
My one and only son.

281
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,041
This is Tarjo, our youngest.

282
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,375
I'm Anna.

283
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,750
Tarjo.

284
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,625
He's currently working on his thesis.

285
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,500
Are those your materials?

286
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,875
-Mom.
-What is it, Pur?

287
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,125
Mr. Didik suddenly had to take
his child to the hospital,

288
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,875
but the archery team
has to go to the arena

289
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,375
for today's tournament.

290
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,458
We need someone to drive them.

291
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,250
Mr. Didik says
he can only pick them up afterward.

292
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,083
-I'll drive them, Mom.
-Forget it.

293
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,291
There's no alternative.
Who will take them there?

294
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,583
All right. Go ahead.

295
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,250
Anna, would you like to go
and watch archery with Tarjo?

296
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,750
Jemparingan archery
is different from the usual kind.

297
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,916
You said
you'd like to learn Javanese culture.

298
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,000
Huh? This isn't the place, sir.

299
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,958
There's no one here.

300
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,791
Well, jemparingan archery
is not that popular yet.

301
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,083
There aren't even
any tournament banners here.

302
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,875
Are you sure this is the place, sir?

303
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,750
This is the location, sir.

304
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,833
Good grief!
I thought it was at the sports arena.

305
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:43,958
Fine, then.

306
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,958
If we arrive late and get disqualified,

307
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,625
I'm holding you responsible.

308
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,375
Go, sir!

309
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,958
Mr. Tarjo…

310
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,916
Mr. Tarjo!

311
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,458
Quiet, everyone!

312
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,541
Stay focused on the tournament.

313
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,875
WELCOME
JEMPARINGAN ATHLETES

314
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,750
Come on.

315
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,083
-Thanks, sir.
-You're welcome.

316
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,000
-Thanks, Mr. Tarjo.
-Sure.

317
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,083
Good luck! Let's go!

318
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,458
This is very unprofessional!

319
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,250
Let's go and watch.

320
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,708
I'm feeling guilty about Mr. Rosyid.

321
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,583
Besides, I have to return the car.

322
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,416
When it's over,
and you'd like to go somewhere else,

323
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,625
just message me.

324
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,791
All right. Fine.

325
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,041
Miss. Wait.

326
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,291
I've read it.

327
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,416
-It's very good.
-Really?

328
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,708
Really. Top quality, I swear.

329
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,208
Miss Pur.

330
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,416
Yes, sir?

331
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,125
Here you go.

332
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,541
I drove a customer
to Parangkusumo Beach earlier,

333
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,916
and I bought this.

334
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,708
For me?

335
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,333
Yes, just a souvenir.

336
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,125
I bought one for Mrs. Broto and Yuni too.

337
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,833
That one is for…

338
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,791
-Thank you.
-Sure.

339
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,708
I have to go to the front lobby now.

340
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,375
-Okay.
-Right.

341
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,041
INITIAL INVESTMENT

342
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,291
Kar.

343
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,125
Sorry I'm late.

344
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,166
You're always late, Jo.

345
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,583
By the way,
I've taken a look at your proposal.

346
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,125
It's good, but I have one concern.

347
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,166
-The cost?
-Well, that too.

348
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,666
But I think the main concern is time.

349
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,250
If we do this,

350
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,458
we will have to travel
around Indonesia in a year's time.

351
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,291
Are you okay with leaving the guesthouse?

352
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,166
That's not a problem.

353
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,500
Fine, then.

354
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,875
-Don't forget the meeting this afternoon.
-Okay.

355
00:21:58,833 --> 00:21:59,958
What are you working on?

356
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,875
The description for TWS.

357
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,541
For the past few days,
I noticed you only come here with Menik.

358
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,750
Where's Jarot, your husband?

359
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,000
No idea, Mom.

360
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,958
He left this morning.

361
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,333
Don't lie to me, Sri.

362
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,791
If you have a problem, tell me.

363
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,916
You're right.

364
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,708
I do have a problem,

365
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,333
but it doesn't mean
I can't solve it myself.

366
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,458
I can handle it.

367
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:42,916
Who says you can't?

368
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,833
Jarot received a residency offer, Mom.

369
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:55,958
In the Netherlands.

370
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,958
So he's busy dealing with everything,

371
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,166
not to mention looking for sponsors.

372
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,208
That's great.

373
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,291
And how about you and Menik?

374
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,416
Will you go too? Or stay here?

375
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:14,291
If Jarot wants to go by himself,
that's fine.

376
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,541
Besides, my life is here, Mom.

377
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,833
I can raise Menik by myself.

378
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,958
Oh, that's how you do it?
Can you teach me?

379
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,916
MISS ANNA
JO, I'M ALL DONE HERE.

380
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,291
CAN YOU TAKE ME SOMEWHERE?
THERE'S A PLACE I REALLY WANT TO VISIT

381
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,750
OKAY, I'M ON MY WAY

382
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,541
Watch the stairs.

383
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,250
You can take pictures.

384
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,416
-Can we enter?
-Of course.

385
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,708
You know, in a Javanese wedding,

386
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,833
if the groom can't attend,

387
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,583
maybe due to illness,

388
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,333
they can use a keris as his replacement.

389
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,500
That's why I want to know
the manufacturing process of a keris.

390
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,791
Actually, I want to know

391
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:52,666
the process of creating masculinity,

392
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,625
the procedure to become a man.

393
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:56,791
Well, not me, per se.

394
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,666
The character in my novel wants to know.

395
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,833
SEKAR
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

396
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:22,375
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU AT THE CAFÉ!

397
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:32,583
I'm surprised
you know a lot about the culture.

398
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,500
All from the Internet.

399
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,666
I don't actually know much.

400
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,875
Just sufficient research for my writing.

401
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:46,500
Ikigai.

402
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,666
"Ikigai"?

403
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,750
A Japanese philosophy.

404
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:56,916
Iki means life. Gai means value.

405
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,125
Basically, our purpose in life.

406
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:03,875
Personally,
I feel valuable when I'm writing.

407
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:08,541
Once we identify our ikigai,
we can live our lives with passion.

408
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,791
Makes you think, huh?

409
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,125
I think that's my problem.

410
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,333
For my mother,
her ikigai is definitely the guesthouse.

411
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,000
My father's ikigai is his family.

412
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,708
Pur and Sri

413
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,875
have obviously found theirs.

414
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,166
That's okay.

415
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,791
You'll find yours. I believe that.

416
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:46,166
I bet Mr. Jody's ikigai is his job, right?

417
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,791
Maybe so.

418
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,833
The rooms?

419
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,250
The rooms, Atmo.

420
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,375
Cleanliness?

421
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,541
-Atmo.
-Why is that?

422
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,416
Sir.

423
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,291
You're hopeless.

424
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:28,833
Mr. Rosyid, you're finally home.

425
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:32,375
How was the tournament?

426
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,958
You won a medal! Congratulations!

427
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,958
It's just a bronze medal!

428
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,250
Third place means nothing.

429
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:42,750
Nothing!

430
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,708
There can only be one winner. Just one.

431
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,750
-I already know the reason.
-What's that?

432
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:56,500
Mr. Tarjo drove us to the wrong stadium.

433
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,333
The children lost their focus.

434
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:04,875
-You're right.
-We barely made it in time.

435
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:09,458
As a result, we were prepared to lose
right from the beginning.

436
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,875
We're heading inside now.

437
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:16,625
-Come.
-I'm sorry.

438
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,333
-My apologies.
-It's fine.

439
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,541
-Let's go, everyone.
-Go ahead.

440
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,208
Leave it. What are you doing?

441
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:27,791
Come in.

442
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:45,708
Honey.

443
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,375
When will Jody return?

444
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,083
Poor Anna is all alone.

445
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,083
Why don't you take her around the city?

446
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:02,708
And who will take care of the guesthouse?
Who will man the front desk?

447
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:04,541
I can do that.

448
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,791
Tell Tarjo to do it.

449
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,833
-Tarjo?
-Mm-hmm.

450
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm not so sure about that.

451
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,000
He's the only one available.

452
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,708
-Mo? What is that?
-Yes, sir?

453
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,541
-Miss Anna ordered this.
-All right.

454
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,500
-Take care of it.
-Okay.

455
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,625
-Jo.
-Yeah, Dad?

456
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,875
You did it again.

457
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,708
How could you take the kids
to the wrong venue?

458
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,833
I'm just the driver, Dad.

459
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,166
He didn't specify the address.

460
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,833
It's stuff like this
that makes me doubt you.

461
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,625
Every time I assign a task to you,
it ends in disaster.

462
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,958
I'm sorry, Dad.

463
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,416
-But at least I tried.
-Whatever, just go.

464
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:12,291
Are we being too hard on Tarjo?

465
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,875
Are we being too hard on Tarjo?

466
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,000
Not really.

467
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,500
In fact, I think we're too soft.

468
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,666
Tarjo is a boy.

469
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,458
UNTITLED
CULTURE FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW

470
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,375
THIS IS MY FIRST DRAFT
PLEASE READ IT

471
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,458
But this was your idea.

472
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:16,291
If this isn't a priority for you, fine.
But it's definitely my priority.

473
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:22,083
I know the drill. You'll apologize,

474
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,041
buy me flowers, bring me presents,

475
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,833
and that's it.

476
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:27,833
Am I right?

477
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,000
That's what you want.

478
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:35,166
Just because you want that
doesn't mean I do.

479
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Listen.

480
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:41,500
A one-week vacation won't solve
a problem we've been having for years.

481
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,250
Click this button here to open the form.

482
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:50,500
How do we check the input data
to make sure it's correct?

483
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,250
They'll have to fill out
a declaration form

484
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,708
before submitting the data.

485
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,791
-I see.
-Yes.

486
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,208
Any suggestions?

487
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,291
No. This is fine.

488
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,166
What's the next step?

489
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,875
Sekar, you have to read this novel.

490
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:10,666
It's perfect for a sample at TWS.
The culture clash is very evident.

491
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,583
Jo, please focus.

492
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:16,916
Fine.

493
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:18,500
You were saying?

494
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,750
This is the registration.

495
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,083
The form will pop up.

496
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,041
You fill out the declaration,

497
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:29,791
submit the data,

498
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,666
and then you make your choice, sir.

499
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,541
In this part,
we'll state the destinations,

500
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,708
maybe Asia, and list the countries,
such as Japan, Korea, etc.

501
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,458
Then the same thing for America,
even Indonesia.

502
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,833
We'll get into the details too.

503
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:49,041
Bali, Bandung, or whatever.

504
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:54,791
The layout is approved.
We just need to upload the materials.

505
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,875
Jo? Why are you staring?
Stop it. She'll feel uncomfortable.

506
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:02,208
She's not a stranger.

507
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,333
What do you mean?

508
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,833
That's Mrs. Anna, from the guesthouse.
I know her.

509
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,083
You brought her here?

510
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,291
Are you okay?

511
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:28,500
You were right.

512
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,666
Jody cares more about his work than me.

513
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,166
What do you mean?

514
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,958
-Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.
-Don't bother.

515
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,291
It's not your fault.

516
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:43,083
I thought
this vacation would fix everything.

517
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,041
I was wrong.

518
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,500
Twenty years.

519
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,250
No one supported me in being a writer.

520
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,208
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,500
I didn't mean to vent.

522
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,291
It's okay. I understand.

523
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:13,916
If you ever need a friend to talk to,

524
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,125
or if you want to vent, just tell me.

525
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:18,875
I'll keep you company.

526
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:37,333
-Is it ready?
-Yes, ma'am.

527
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,833
Sari, please help with that.

528
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,375
-Mr. Broto will definitely want some.
-Help him, Sari.

529
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,875
-Sure.
-Sari, please bring this.

530
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,708
-Careful.
-Yes, ma'am.

531
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:52,875
Yeah.

532
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,333
New bracelet, huh?

533
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,916
Yes, from Mr. Par. You got one too, Mom.

534
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,041
Of course not.
Why would Partono give me a bracelet?

535
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,166
-Yun.
-Yes, miss?

536
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,291
-Mr. Par gave you a bracelet too, right?
-No, he didn't.

537
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:14,250
How sweet…

538
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,166
Miss Pur.

539
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:19,625
-How sweet.
-It's a pretty bracelet, Pur.

540
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:22,375
-It matches you, miss.
-Mm-hmm.

541
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,458
How sweet.

542
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,791
This is Sekar, Miss Anna.

543
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:36,958
This is Miss Anna.

544
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:39,500
-Anna.
-Sekar.

545
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,708
Sorry for intruding.

546
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:46,250
I thought you were only here
for coffee, not work.

547
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,541
It's fine. It wasn't anything serious.

548
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,000
We were only checking the design for TWS.

549
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
May I see?

550
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:55,750
Sure.

551
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,708
This is the website design.

552
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:08,125
This is pretty good. Great work, Jo.

553
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:15,208
I'm going to go home now.

554
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,125
-Bye, miss.
-Bye.

555
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,041
Bye.

556
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,250
Jo.

557
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:27,875
I still have a list of places
to visit for research purposes.

558
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,875
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

559
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,750
What's going on with you and Sri?

560
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,125
How long will this last?

561
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,916
What do you mean, honey?

562
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:47,750
Honey.

563
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,416
When Jarot finishes work,

564
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,458
Sri leaves for work.

565
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:57,875
And when Sri finishes work,
Jarot leaves for work.

566
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,791
They barely see each other.

567
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,916
That's right, Dad. I'm still learning.

568
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,791
Learning to make the time for us.

569
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,833
"Still learning."

570
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,708
But we have good news, honey.

571
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:16,708
-What?
-Right, Jarot?

572
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,250
-"News"?
-Tell him.

573
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:27,666
-Which one? What good news, Mom?
-What is it?

574
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,666
Is Sri pregnant again?

575
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:35,750
Is that it?

576
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,375
-That's not what I heard.
-Huh?

577
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,041
Your news.

578
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,083
-My news?
-Yes, that one.

579
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,250
Right, Mom.

580
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,541
Listen, Dad, Pur.

581
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:57,208
Sri recently received a job offer

582
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:02,500
to record and perform at several cafés.

583
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,125
But there's a catch.

584
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:10,541
Sri has to stay in Bandung
for several weeks.

585
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,583
So what will you do?

586
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,791
Well, I will stay in Yogyakarta.

587
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,708
How about Menik?

588
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,333
Menik.

589
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,041
Menik…

590
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:44,333
The truth is,
I want to take care of Menik,

591
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:47,666
but Sri doesn't feel confident

592
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,250
if I do it all by myself.

593
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:54,916
She wants Menik to go with her.

594
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:58,333
You two are complicated.

595
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:00,875
I guess so, Dad.

596
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,375
Eat, Menik.

597
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:17,250
Are you seriously doing research
in a place like this?

598
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,416
Yes, I am. What's the big deal?

599
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,583
If you really read my draft,
you would know why I had to come here.

600
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,000
Honestly, it's my first time
in a place like this.

601
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:29,708
Is that so?

602
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,583
-Let's go.
-Yup.

603
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,958
-You got it?
-Yes.

604
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,416
-Okay?
-Yeah.

605
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,583
Slowly, please.

606
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,666
-That's it.
-All good?

607
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,875
-I'm fine.
-Okay.

608
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,958
-Take your time.
-Hold on.

609
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,708
Should we stop first?

610
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,666
-Good to go?
-Yeah.

611
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,375
-Watch your step.
-Yeah.

612
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:08,958
Okay.

613
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,541
-I can walk by myself.
-It's okay.

614
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:17,125
-I got it.
-It's my responsibility. I took you there.

615
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,083
-No.
-I'll take you to your room. Come on.

616
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,250
There's no need.

617
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,875
Thank you.

618
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,708
-Thank you. Yes.
-Yeah.

619
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,958
I will never forget this night.

620
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:29,416
This is the best night ever.

621
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,375
I'll never forget it.

622
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:35,125
It's late. Why is Tarjo not home yet?

623
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,583
He's with a guest, honey.

624
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:43,333
Maybe he took Anna to a wayang show.

625
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:46,375
Yeah, right!

626
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,291
Kids their age don't watch wayang.

627
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,500
Impossible.

628
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:55,833
Don't worry about it.

629
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:59,708
We have to give Tarjo his freedom.

630
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,666
Let's just trust him.

631
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,333
BASED ON LOSMEN, THE TV SERIES

632
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:58,041
