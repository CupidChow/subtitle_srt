1
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,083
This TWS program has the potential

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,541
to boost tourism
and the local MSME economy, sir.

3
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,208
But it will take a while
to recoup our investment.

4
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,666
Well, we prioritize sustainability
over quick profit.

5
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,791
I don't think this project is for me.

6
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,416
Please, sir, maybe you can reconsider.

7
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,416
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,083
Maybe it's time for us…
to try for a bank loan.

9
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,875
Didn't you listen
during yesterday's guidance meeting?

10
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:19,875
They're assessing how our financial plan
can attract investors.

11
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,708
It's okay. We'll keep looking tomorrow.

12
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,250
LOSMEN BU BROTO: THE SERIES

13
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,333
How are you doing, Mr. Broto?

14
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,291
Dying to go home already?

15
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,250
Missing home already?

16
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,250
Yes, sir.

17
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,333
I always miss home.

18
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,583
All right, then.

19
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,541
You're free to go home.

20
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,791
Are you serious?

21
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,583
I'm free?

22
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,708
Yes.

23
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,458
You are.

24
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,541
You're free, Mr. Broto.

25
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,166
-I'll be off, then.
-Go ahead, sir.

26
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,958
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

27
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,958
Miss Pur.

28
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,291
Yes, Mr. Par.

29
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,875
-Yeah.
-What is it?

30
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,208
Sir.

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,375
Are you okay?

32
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:06,958
Miss, actually, I…

33
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,250
I know…

34
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:29,958
that I'm not worthy enough of you.

35
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,041
You…

36
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,583
deserve the best…

37
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,958
but if…

38
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:48,666
May I… try

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,791
to become a man worthy

40
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,125
of… you?

41
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,500
Mr. Par…

42
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,875
Mr. Broto is home!

43
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,291
Are you well, sir?

44
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,458
-Are you well?
-Yes, sir.

45
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,166
Where are the others?

46
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,083
-Please call Sri.
-Yes.

47
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,416
Wait a minute.

48
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,083
Pur.

49
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,833
Are you well, Dad?

50
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:33,833
I'm fine.

51
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,250
-You're okay, right?
-Yes.

52
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,625
Dad.

53
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,416
Jo.

54
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,958
It's all right.

55
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,291
Yes, I know.

56
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,875
Stop it. No need to be sad.

57
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,000
Honey.

58
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,208
Honey.

59
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,125
Are you well?

60
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,958
It's okay. I'm fine.

61
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,541
Mr. Par.

62
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,666
Miss Pur.

63
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:45,875
Mr. Par.

64
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,916
Thank you so much
for being so kind to me all this time.

65
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,916
Of course.

66
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,250
I also

67
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,125
like you very much…

68
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,125
I mean,

69
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:07,208
I like being able to show you… kindness.

70
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,250
-Yes. So, the truth is--
-Miss Pur.

71
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,041
I'm done with the dishes.

72
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,166
You said
you're in a hurry to prepare lunch.

73
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,166
Right. Thank you.

74
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,875
-What were you saying, miss?
-Yes…

75
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,875
-So, I--
-Sir.

76
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,833
Mr. Par.

77
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:49,208
Mrs. Broto is asking about the guest list
from Bali. Do you have it?

78
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,833
Yes, I got it. I'll handle it later.

79
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,958
Okay. Miss.

80
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,541
How sweet!

81
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,333
So you were saying?

82
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,125
Mr. Par,

83
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,500
I'm terribly sorry,

84
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,083
but I'm not ready yet.

85
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,458
Excuse me. I have to go to the kitchen.

86
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,041
Okay, miss.

87
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,708
Miss Pur.

88
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,250
Do we have any carrots?

89
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,166
Sure.

90
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,833
-Where?
-Refrigerator.

91
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,333
-The market?
-The refrigerator.

92
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,333
Right.

93
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,500
Carrots, check.

94
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,833
BIBIMBAP RECIPE

95
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,541
INGREDIENTS

96
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,791
How about eggs, miss?

97
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,458
Eggs.

98
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,375
Cucumber?

99
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,583
Miss.

100
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,500
I need a big one.

101
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,958
Long and big. This will do.

102
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,166
Miss, I also need gochujang.

103
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,625
What's that?

104
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,000
What are you cooking?

105
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,583
I want to cook bibimbap, miss.

106
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,166
Sounds like a hassle.

107
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,416
Just use peanut sauce.
I'm about to make some.

108
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,291
Peanut sauce is for Indonesian food,
like sego pecel.

109
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,583
This is bibimbap.

110
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:32,791
Miss Pur.

111
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,291
I miss Ji Hae.

112
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,000
I miss her cooking as well.

113
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,458
That's why I want to make bibimbap.

114
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,375
Fine. Let me see the recipe.
I'll cook it for you.

115
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,333
How are you, sir?

116
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,333
-I'm good.
-Please sit.

117
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,166
Number 613.

118
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,208
-That's me.
-Please.

119
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,291
I'll just pull over here, sir.

120
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,166
-Right here.
-Okay.

121
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,416
-Please wait for your change.
-No need. You can keep it.

122
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,833
I'm off.

123
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,000
-Thank you, sir.
-Sure.

124
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,000
Must be my lucky day.

125
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,458
Ji Hae.

126
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,041
I miss you.

127
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,500
Comb your hair first.

128
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,041
Listen to Daddy. Comb your hair.

129
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,958
Come on, Menik. Let's comb your hair.

130
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,250
You said you wanted an apple.
Come and get it.

131
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,083
This smells good, Pur.

132
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,541
-New recipe?
-Yes, Mom, it's new.

133
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,125
I'm trying a new recipe
for the guesthouse.

134
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,750
Your cooking doesn't always have to be
for the guesthouse.

135
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,833
No big deal.
I enjoy cooking for the guesthouse.

136
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,875
-Want to try it?
-Of course I do!

137
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,916
-That's too much, Pur.
-It's okay.

138
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,125
Here you go, Mom.

139
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,125
Just from the smell,
I'm sure it's delicious.

140
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,916
It's amazing, Pur.

141
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,791
Delicious.

142
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,583
What do you think
about enrolling in culinary school?

143
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:32,500
But who's going to handle
the kitchen here, Mom?

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,416
Never mind that.

145
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,541
You don't have to worry, Pur.

146
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,375
We still have Yuni and Hendro.

147
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,000
Your life doesn't always have to revolve
around the guesthouse kitchen.

148
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,916
If you're interested,
I'll discuss it with your dad.

149
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,083
This chicken is so tender, Pur.

150
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,958
-Very well marinated.
-Really, Mom?

151
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:56,958
It's the best.

152
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,583
I got a call
from a potential investor yesterday.

153
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,125
His name is Yudhis.

154
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,625
He's an entrepreneur,
the son of my mom's friend.

155
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,125
Yeah? So what did he say?

156
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,250
He's willing to help TWS.

157
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,791
I'm scheduling our next meeting.

158
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,041
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, Jo.

159
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,625
Thanks for meeting me again.

160
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,583
No problem. Let's sit.

161
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,750
Well, sir?

162
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,291
I've taken a look
at the proposal you sent me yesterday.

163
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,958
After reviewing and discussing it
with my internal team…

164
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,583
we agreed to invest
in Traveling with Strangers.

165
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,583
Seriously?

166
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,875
As long as you promise to commit.

167
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,166
Of course. Definitely, sir.

168
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,208
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

169
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,416
Now this is what I'm talking about.

170
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,875
I've always had faith in this concept
from the beginning.

171
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,375
No more revisions needed. Just focus.

172
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,958
I'm not the only one who determines
whether you graduate or not.

173
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,250
There will be other lecturers.

174
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,833
-Yes, ma'am.
-Understood?

175
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,375
All right, then.

176
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,291
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Sure.

177
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,583
How's everything, Jo? Are you ready?

178
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,166
What's wrong?

179
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,041
-It just hit me, Mom.
-What?

180
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,083
I made a grave mistake…

181
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,625
and got Dad detained by the police.

182
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,416
Just look on the bright side, Jo.

183
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,750
Everything happens for a reason.

184
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,708
You learned a lesson from that incident.

185
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:29,458
And now, you know how to tell
between right and wrong.

186
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,541
Isn't that right?

187
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,000
But what if I fail to graduate, Mom?

188
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,750
Well, you'll still be our son.

189
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,708
Even though I've let you both down?

190
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:49,583
Even though you've let us down.

191
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,541
Come on. Get ready.
Good luck with your exam.

192
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,000
-Okay.
-I wish you the best.

193
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,791
Mr. Tarjo!

194
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,541
Yes!

195
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,583
Sir! Ma'am!

196
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,375
Mr. Tarjo is home!

197
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,625
-Jo?
-Were you waiting for me?

198
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,000
Jo?

199
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,583
-Well, Jo?
-How was it?

200
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,083
-Come here. What's with your expression?
-How was it?

201
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,541
-Well, Jo?
-I passed.

202
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,000
A graduate! My son is a graduate!

203
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,708
-My son is a graduate!
-My son passed!

204
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:01,083
He's a graduate! Wow!

205
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,625
-Gosh! I'm so relieved! My God!
-Graduate!

206
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,708
-Jo, you passed?
-Yes, I did, Pur!

207
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,833
Oh my! Praise God!

208
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,458
I'm so happy!

209
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,708
-Honey.
-Let's go inside.

210
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,500
-Come on.
-Let's go. Come.

211
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,541
-What do you want to eat, Jo?
-So relieved! My gosh!

212
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:29,500
Cheers. To you, who always stood by me

213
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,541
relentlessly up until now.

214
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:47,458
If it weren't for you,
TWS wouldn't be what it is today.

215
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,708
Thank you.

216
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,375
Thank you.

217
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,375
Come on, let's clap.

218
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,000
If I sing along, I bet you'd cry.

219
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,583
I have a surprise for you.

220
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,750
Want to see it?

221
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,791
-Yeah? This should be faced this way.
-What kind of surprise, Daddy?

222
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:53,791
You too.

223
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,291
Wait a minute.

224
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,958
Come to Mommy. Here.

225
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
Here it is.

226
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,833
Where are you going?

227
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,541
-Come here.
-Come on.

228
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,416
-Look.
-This is cool.

229
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,166
-Here, sweetheart.
-Right.

230
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,500
Ready?

231
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:22,916
Menik,

232
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,333
Daddy has to go to the Netherlands.

233
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,208
It's very far away.

234
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,083
-But--
-By car?

235
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,041
No, I can't. I have to go by plane.

236
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,250
But if you miss me,

237
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,208
you can look at these pictures.

238
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,166
While I'm there,

239
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,250
I need you

240
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,458
to listen to your mommy.

241
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,000
And when you feel like
you miss me too much,

242
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,250
we can talk on the phone.

243
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,666
Even every day is fine.

244
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,416
-Okay?
-Okay.

245
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,708
Promise, Daddy?

246
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,375
Promise that, Daddy.

247
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,875
-You promise?
-I promise.

248
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,208
Who's that?

249
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,333
Menik must be very proud of you.

250
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:30,458
Seeing her daddy make it
all the way to the Netherlands.

251
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,125
Pray for us, honey,

252
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,083
so that we can come to you
as soon as possible.

253
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,791
Amen.

254
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,250
We'll come to Daddy, okay?

255
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,750
You want to?

256
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,625
ANTON
SON OF SARJONO

257
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:51,625
Gosh, Tarjo. You're a graduate.

258
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:57,916
-Thank you, Pur.
-The first graduate in the family.

259
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,333
-Come on. Ready for the picture?
-Yes, let's go.

260
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:09,083
Okay, Ndro.

261
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,041
Mom, I'm heading back to the kitchen.

262
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,041
-Still have a lot to do?
-Yes.

263
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,375
Okay.

264
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,458
-It's good.
-Yes, sir.

265
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,125
-All right. Thank you.
-Sir.

266
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,875
Let me transfer the data. Come with me.

267
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:24,000
Why didn't you tell me?
I could've helped out.

268
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,625
You were busy
preparing for the move to the Netherlands.

269
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,416
Listen, Mom, Dad.

270
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,375
Both of us have decided

271
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:41,083
that I'll be going there alone.

272
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,750
Sri and Menik will stay in Indonesia.

273
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,750
I'm sorry, Mom.

274
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,666
Why should you be sorry?

275
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:03,041
Only you two know
what’s best for yourselves.

276
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,583
Your father and I

277
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,500
will agree if that's your final decision.

278
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,791
It's like you said, Sri.

279
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,416
Each family
has its own way of doing things.

280
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:23,458
I'm sure Menik must be proud

281
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:28,416
of having
such hardworking parents for her sake.

282
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,333
Right, Menik?

283
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,125
-Yeah? Are you proud?
-I'm proud.

284
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,750
Sweetheart.

285
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,833
-Sir.
-Yes?

286
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,166
-Please put this up too.
-Will do.

287
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,958
-Use however much you need.
-Okay.

288
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,333
-No need to use all of it.
-One, two, three…

289
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,250
Five.

290
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,666
-Okay.
-Make it neat.

291
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,583
Will do.

292
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,708
How's it going, boss? Enjoying your rest?

293
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:05,875
Well?

294
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,916
-It's fine. Just sit.
-I'm good.

295
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,083
No, I'm good. I'll help.

296
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:12,625
Go ahead.

297
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,708
Don't forget
to serve the welcome drinks, okay?

298
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,041
I'll leave it to you.

299
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,333
Oh my God! Mr. Atmo!

300
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,041
Mr. Sugeng! Mr. Urip!

301
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,250
What do we do? Atmo!

302
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,458
Gosh! Oh my God!

303
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,750
He just fainted out of nowhere.

304
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:39,458
-Over here.
-Don't just stand there. Help!

305
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:42,875
-Come on.
-One, two, three.

306
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,250
Atmo! My God, Mr. Atmo!

307
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,333
Don't crowd him.

308
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:52,041
My gosh. If you're sick,
you should take a break from work.

309
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,291
Just rest, Mr. Atmo.

310
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:58,750
If I don't work,
then when can I fly to Korea, Yun?

311
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,125
But if you're ill,
then who will fly to Korea?

312
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,291
Ji Hae will understand.

313
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:08,458
I miss her desperately, Yun.

314
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,583
She's already asking
when I'm coming to Korea.

315
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,583
Do you owe her a debt or something?
Why is she pushing you like that?

316
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,041
Well, that's love, Yun.

317
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,958
-You don't understand.
-I do understand.

318
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,250
You put her under a spell, right?

319
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,916
Nonsense. Watch what you say!

320
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,250
If anything,
she's the one who put a spell on me.

321
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,583
Right, we're done here.

322
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:34,541
Mr. Atmo is back on his feet.
Let's get back to work.

323
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,916
-But he just fainted.
-Was he faking it?

324
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,083
Let's get back to work, everybody!

325
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,375
All right. Let's go.

326
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:43,916
It's okay.

327
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He's fine. Let's get back to work.

328
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,958
Iced tea? Anyone want some iced tea?

329
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,166
Iced tea, anyone?

330
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,958
I have to be strong for my love.

331
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,041
In God's name.

332
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,875
I was thinking

333
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:02,083
if Pur enrolls in culinary school,

334
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,083
she can get out
of the guesthouse for a while.

335
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,291
See the outside world, you know?

336
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:13,625
She won't be cooped up here all the time.

337
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,208
I know.

338
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:22,875
But… are you sure?

339
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,166
Well…

340
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,166
When I see Pur cooking,

341
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:37,458
looking so eager when trying a new recipe…

342
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:43,125
I feel like I'm seeing the old Pur again.

343
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,833
Like that time
when she went out with Partono.

344
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,041
I love seeing that side of her.

345
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:54,166
I want her to be like that all the time.

346
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,083
I know.

347
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,041
Well…

348
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,250
Our kids are all grown up now, honey.

349
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:06,041
Tarjo, Sri…

350
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:06,958
I know.

351
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:13,333
And now, they're actually smarter
than their parents. Right?

352
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:19,166
What we thought was wrong
for Jarot and Sri

353
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,916
turned out to be right for them, honey.

354
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:32,375
My dream of seeing one of my children
obtain a bachelor's degree

355
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:33,750
has finally come true,

356
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,250
even though the road wasn't easy.

357
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,625
Right.

358
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,833
All right. What's that?

359
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:44,250
-Where are you going?
-No, I mean this one.

360
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,125
-Mr. At…
-I'm okay, Ji Hae.

361
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:57,083
Ji Hae, I'm sorry.

362
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:03,583
I can't fly there. I won't be able
to celebrate chuseok with you.

363
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:08,250
It's okay. Just take care of yourself.

364
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,250
But I really miss you.

365
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:14,083
I really miss you.

366
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:17,333
I miss you, Ji Hae.

367
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:27,791
OFFICE

368
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:41,833
Excuse me, ma'am.

369
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:43,916
What is it, Yun?

370
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:46,875
Here's the thing.

371
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:52,000
Truthfully, Mr. Atmo asked me not to tell,

372
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,166
but I feel so sorry for him, ma'am.

373
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,416
What's wrong?

374
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,250
Mr. Atmo is ill, ma'am.

375
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,916
What's wrong with him?

376
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,791
Fatigue, I think.

377
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:08,666
For the past few weeks,
he's been driving passengers at night

378
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,541
for extra money
to buy a plane ticket to Korea.

379
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,333
But instead, he fainted.

380
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:15,458
My gosh.

381
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,083
So how is he doing now?

382
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,708
He's getting better, ma'am.

383
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,791
But I overheard him
canceling his trip to Korea.

384
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,625
He's not going?

385
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,750
Poor Atmo.

386
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,500
I'm sorry if I'm overstepping.
I'll leave now, ma'am.

387
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,250
Excuse me.

388
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,333
Poor Atmo.

389
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,875
Still not enough.

390
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,583
Sir.

391
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,041
I heard you were sick.

392
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,208
So why are you counting money?

393
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,125
Who's sick, sir? I'm fine.

394
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,458
You look pale.

395
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,750
It's okay, Atmo.

396
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,833
I know about your situation.

397
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,375
Sit properly.

398
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,916
How much do you need to go to Korea?

399
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,625
It's okay, sir.

400
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,750
I've bothered you enough all this time.

401
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,708
I don't want to be a burden.

402
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,583
You and Mrs. Broto
have been more than generous to me.

403
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,000
Atmo, I know

404
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:05,250
that during your time
working in this guesthouse,

405
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:08,250
you've always been generous
with your time and effort.

406
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,541
So how can we not be generous in return?

407
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:14,708
How much?

408
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:21,458
Thank you so much, sir.
I really appreciate this.

409
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:25,041
I will always pray for your health.

410
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,375
Amen.

411
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:29,666
-And Miss Pur and Miss Sri's success.
-Amen.

412
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,166
The important thing is
you need to be healthy.

413
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,458
Yes, sir.

414
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,000
All right, then.

415
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,833
Thank you.

416
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,708
Jo.

417
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,083
Yes, Dad?

418
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,208
First of all, I'd like to say thank you.

419
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,583
For what, Dad?

420
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,958
You didn't just listen to me…

421
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,208
you also put my words into action.

422
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,500
We all make mistakes.

423
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:27,500
But what matters is

424
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,416
how we take responsibility for it

425
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,750
and learn from that mistake.

426
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:38,958
You worked hard to push forward

427
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,708
until you finally graduated.

428
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:45,250
And for that, I'm proud of you, son.

429
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,250
From now on, if anything happens,

430
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,750
let's discuss it together.

431
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,791
Sour gourami with torch ginger.

432
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,875
Here it is.

433
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:15,291
Sour gourami with torch ginger.

434
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:21,208
Specially made to welcome you back home,
reunited with the family.

435
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:25,250
With Tarjo, Jarot, Sri, and Pur.

436
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,958
I feel incredibly happy.

437
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,375
Thank you, honey.

438
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,958
Why are you so kind to me?

439
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:41,875
Kids, thank you so much for being here.

440
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,708
I'm so glad and happy
we can be together again.

441
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,125
-Yes, Dad.
-All right.

442
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:50,416
Let's dig in.

443
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,875
What a beautiful sight.

444
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:55,500
The entire Broto family.
The whole team. No one missing, right?

445
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That's right.

446
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,625
BASED ON LOSMEN, THE TV SERIES

447
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,833
LOSMEN BU BROTO: THE SERIES

448
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:14,458
Mr. Par, thank you so much
for your kindness all this time.

449
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,125
I'm sure that one day

450
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,916
you will meet someone
who will return all your kindness.

451
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:22,750
Yes, miss.

452
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:26,041
I have something for you.

453
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,166
Thank you so much.

454
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,083
Thank you, miss.

455
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:41,041
Thanks for letting me study
at culinary school again.

456
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:44,458
Let's have video calls often.
I'll miss you.

457
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,458
Please pray for me, Mom.

458
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,000
-Pray for me, Dad.
-Pur.

459
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,458
Study hard, okay?

460
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,750
-See you, honey.
-Yes.

461
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:57,416
Yuni, take care of the kitchen, okay?

462
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,333
Dad.

463
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,416
I'm leaving, Dad.

464
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,375
Yes.

465
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,250
-Mom.
-Don't forget to make time.

466
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,166
You must call Sri and Menik.

467
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:07,750
Hear that, honey?

468
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:11,500
What is it?

469
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,833
I'm off.

470
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,333
-What else do you want? Huh?
-I'm leaving.

471
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,166
-Miss Sri.
-Yes, Atmo.

472
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,833
Take care, Atmo.

473
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,625
Take care.

474
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:26,541
Excuse me.

475
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:35,166
Welcome to Mrs. Broto's Guesthouse.
