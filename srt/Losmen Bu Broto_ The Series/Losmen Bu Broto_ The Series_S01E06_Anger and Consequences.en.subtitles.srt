1
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:07,916
Damn it!

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,541
This is not a game, Jo.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,875
This is a serious problem!

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,166
You've brought shame
on this family. Damn it.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,541
-What's going on here, honey?
-Your son.

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,083
He crossed a line with Anna.

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,000
Jo?

8
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,250
I never taught my kids

9
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,083
to interfere in someone else's marriage.

10
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,875
Jody is my good friend.

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,333
Use your head!

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,125
That's enough, honey.

13
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,166
Let's talk calmly.

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,583
There's a cause and reason for everything.

15
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,583
Good grief. You always defend your son!

16
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,708
Yeah, keep doing that.

17
00:00:58,958 --> 00:00:59,833
Hey.

18
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,166
Answer me. Don't just stay silent!

19
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,916
Let me ask you something.

20
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,500
Did it ever occur to you

21
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,708
that this woman is someone else's wife?

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,291
Answer me, Jo!

23
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,750
-Don't just stay silent. Damn it!
-Honey.

24
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,333
How could this happen?

25
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,333
Fine!

26
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,458
You're making me nuts!

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,916
You need to get out
of this room immediately!

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,833
What's going on here, ma'am?

29
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,250
You have caused a disturbance
in this guesthouse.

30
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,125
It's best if you go home right now.

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,083
-Where's Tarjo?
-Don't you dare go looking for my son!

32
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,333
Stop!

33
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,875
-Where's Anna?
-What the hell?

34
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,500
Tarjo was the one who seduced me.

35
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,375
Watch your mouth.

36
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,083
I know my son very well.

37
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:24,291
He wouldn't have done this
if you didn't initiate it!

38
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,041
I'm in love with Tarjo.

39
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,375
-Jody.
-Where is he? Tarjo!

40
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,375
-Tarjo!
-Mr. Jody, just a minute. Calm down.

41
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,416
-Calm down, sir.
-I need Tarjo. Where is he?

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,208
-Not here. He's dealing with his thesis.
-Get him here!

43
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,291
Calm down, sir.

44
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,916
-Let go of me. Come here!
-Sir!

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,666
Get over here!

46
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,250
My gosh!

47
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,666
-Come here!
-Enough, sir!

48
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,125
-Stop it.
-Hey!

49
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,958
-Sir!
-Honey…

50
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,875
Honey!

51
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,041
Honey.

52
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,125
Is this how you repay me?

53
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,041
I trusted you.

54
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,333
I helped this guesthouse.
And this is what I get?

55
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,708
I'm going to report this place
to the police.

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,500
It's all my fault, Dad.

57
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:21,916
Mom.

58
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:25,791
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,458
This is all my fault.

60
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,875
-Wait. Jo!
-Honey.

61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,583
Honey.

62
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,041
LOSMEN BU BROTO: THE SERIES

63
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,625
You should call Mr. Lukman, our lawyer.

64
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,083
Ask for his advice.

65
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,833
There's no need, honey.

66
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:45,000
No need for that
as long as we remember the events.

67
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,000
We'll write down the chronology

68
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,458
to use as evidence and witness testimony.

69
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,083
Don't you want to try talking to Jody?

70
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,000
Maybe we can solve this issue amicably.

71
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,958
You mean, apologize?

72
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,875
That's unacceptable to me.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,291
I know, honey.

74
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,250
But the girls and I are worried.

75
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,500
Plus, we can't get in touch with Tarjo.

76
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,833
If the worst should happen

77
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,250
and I have to spend the night

78
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,208
at the police station,

79
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,583
it's okay. Just accept it.

80
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,250
The damage has been done.
What else can we do?

81
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,500
The important thing is

82
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,458
you have to stay strong.

83
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,458
The kids need you.

84
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,250
I'm confident that you can do it.

85
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,375
All right?

86
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,375
That's enough.

87
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,708
That's enough.

88
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,708
-Thank you.
-Sure, you're welcome, sir.

89
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,083
Ji Hae.

90
00:06:59,041 --> 00:06:59,916
Kawin?

91
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,750
I mean, married?

92
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,083
But why didn't you tell me
you were engaged in the first place?

93
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,041
I'm so sorry. Because I'm so scared.

94
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,416
Why are you scared?

95
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:22,875
It was…

96
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,250
This is a marriage arrangement
between parents.

97
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,208
I don't want to get married.

98
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:34,625
So I came to Yogyakarta
to run away from this problem.

99
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,000
But my mom…

100
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,250
Wherever I go,
my mom will always come to get me.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,291
And sent my fiancé to Jakarta.

102
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,291
"Eomma"? Your mother?

103
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,916
Your mom is ill?

104
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,458
Ji Hae.

105
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,375
-I purun married with you, but--
-Yes.

106
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,125
…I have to work losmen.

107
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't leave the guesthouse, Ji Hae.

108
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,291
Right now, things are complicated here.

109
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,416
No, please.

110
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,958
Please, let's go to Korea together.

111
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,083
Come to Korea with me.

112
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:44,166
Menik, what do you want me to make?
A bird or a robot?

113
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,166
-A robot.
-A robot? Huh.

114
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,500
How do I make that?

115
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,916
Well, Miss Pur?

116
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,458
-Pur.
-Yes, Mom?

117
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,416
-Partono.
-Yes, ma'am?

118
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,708
I need to ask a favor.

119
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,875
Please find Tarjo.

120
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,750
I got word that he's around here.

121
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,916
Make sure that he's doing okay, Par.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,833
Okay, ma'am.

123
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,666
I'll leave now.

124
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,833
Miss Pur, Menik, I'm leaving. Bye!

125
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,500
Par, wait.

126
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,416
Pur, maybe you should go with Partono.

127
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,833
Menik can stay with me.

128
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,916
-Menik, come play with me.
-Go with Grandma.

129
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,250
Okay.

130
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,541
Tarjo hasn't been here in a while, sir.

131
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,208
I never see him anymore.

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,291
But I heard

133
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,250
that he's hanging out a lot
with his college friends.

134
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,791
I just don't know where.

135
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,583
This is the place.

136
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,416
-Thanks for the info.
-Sure.

137
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,291
-Pur.
-Yes, Mom?

138
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,958
Any news on Tarjo?

139
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,000
-We haven't found him.
-Darn it.

140
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,791
But his friends said

141
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,583
Tarjo will not come home
until his thesis is finished.

142
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,666
-One coffee, please.
-Coming up.

143
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,666
Mr. Tarjo?

144
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,541
I've been looking for you. You're here.

145
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,166
Sir…

146
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,083
Your mother is very worried about you.

147
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,041
Since you left,

148
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,041
Miss Pur and Miss Sri are always anxious.

149
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,666
Yes, I know.

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,250
I'll come home
once I've solved my problems.

151
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,125
Don't burden yourself like this, sir.

152
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,208
If you keep doing this,
you're never going to solve the problem.

153
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,375
Mrs. Broto, Miss Pur, Miss Sri…

154
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,333
they're all extremely worried about you.

155
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,125
They need you.

156
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,416
Come home, sir.

157
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,375
I can't face them yet.

158
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,416
I have unfinished business.

159
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:24,000
Please tell my mother that I'm fine.

160
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,583
Yes, sir.

161
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,791
However… everyone makes mistakes.

162
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,166
What matters is that we learn from them.

163
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,208
Our lives

164
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,833
don't end just because of one mistake…

165
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,666
or one great loss.

166
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,208
I'm off.

167
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,875
WELCOME

168
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,500
MRS. BROTO'S GUESTHOUSE

169
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:36,875
Mom.

170
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,000
What is it, Mom?

171
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,541
You should rest.

172
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,833
Don't shoulder the burden yourself.

173
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,541
How can I not, Sri?

174
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,083
I can't just do nothing.

175
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm concerned about your father and Tarjo.

176
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,625
Tarjo is fine, Mom.

177
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,041
Partono already talked to him.

178
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,291
Give Tarjo space to calm down, Mom.

179
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,416
Do you mean that our family
isn't capable of calming Tarjo down?

180
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:20,958
Just because we search
for peace somewhere else,

181
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,166
it doesn't mean
that this family has failed.

182
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,666
My mom.

183
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,166
My mom, she's getting worse.

184
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,000
But I can't come with you to Korea.

185
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:32,416
Do you think my mom will forgive me
if I stay in Yogyakarta with you?

186
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,291
No, Ji Hae. You have to go back to Korea.

187
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,916
You don't want to be with me?

188
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,083
You don't want?

189
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,083
You don't want us to be together?

190
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,916
You don't want us to be together, Atmo?

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,791
On the contrary, Ji Hae.
I think about it every day.

192
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,333
"What can I do so we can be together?"

193
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,791
"But properly."

194
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,291
Ji Hae.

195
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,625
Go settle your issues in Korea first.

196
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,250
If I obtain some money,
I'll come and find you in Korea.

197
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,583
Let's part with a smile.

198
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,041
INCOMING CALL

199
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,625
-Hello?
-Ma'am, this is Anna.

200
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,000
Anna.

201
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:52,916
I don't want to hear
another word from you.

202
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,041
Hold on, ma'am.

203
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,375
The police are on their way
to the guesthouse.

204
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,458
Please forgive me.

205
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,083
I made a mess of everything.

206
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,625
Oh no.

207
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,583
Remember what I said.

208
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,666
-Yes, Dad.
-If you need anything at all, call me.

209
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:15,958
Dad.

210
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,958
Honey.

211
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,583
Oh no.

212
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,958
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Afternoon.

213
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:25,958
I beg your pardon.

214
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,666
We request you come with us
to the station to provide a statement.

215
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,041
What kind of statement, sir?

216
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,916
It's better
if we discuss this at the police station.

217
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:37,958
All right.

218
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,416
I'm ready. Let's go.

219
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,375
-All right.
-Wait.

220
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,375
Just calm down, honey. Okay?

221
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,000
No need to worry. I'll be just fine.

222
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,333
That's enough, honey.

223
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,750
It's okay.

224
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,083
All right?

225
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,750
-Honey.
-Take care of the kids.

226
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,083
Pur, that's enough. It'll be fine.

227
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,250
Enough. Just pray for me
so everything will be fine.

228
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,833
I'll definitely come back.

229
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,500
All right.

230
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,541
-Let's go, sir.
-This way.

231
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,708
PATROL

232
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,125
What should we do, Mom?

233
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,916
Call Mr. Lukman, our lawyer.

234
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:13,083
Jo, please come home.
Your father has been taken by the police.

235
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,583
Mom, how can we help?

236
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,750
Well…

237
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,625
For now, we have to

238
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,000
stay focused on serving guests.

239
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,250
How are things in the kitchen? All done?

240
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,000
-Mom.
-Mom.

241
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,500
Are you all right?

242
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,250
Have you had breakfast?

243
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,541
Yes, I have.

244
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,458
I'm fine.

245
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,125
Mom.

246
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,666
Don't worry too much.
Sri and I are here to support you.

247
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,458
Mom.

248
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,791
Somehow, I feel like this is all my fault.

249
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,416
Why do you say that?

250
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,208
Don't talk like that.

251
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,833
From the start,
I knew that something was off.

252
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,250
But I didn't dare speak about it

253
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,041
because I thought
Tarjo would distance himself from me,

254
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,291
and you would too.

255
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,083
I can't have that.

256
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,041
That's not true, Mom.

257
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,083
Mom.

258
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,083
We are all grateful to you.

259
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:52,250
The three of us have become better people
thanks to you.

260
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,875
Because you always speak candidly.

261
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:00,125
Yes, Mom.
We miss the way you speak bluntly.

262
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,625
You say you miss it,
but if I speak bluntly, you'll get upset.

263
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,125
-Told you, Pur.
-You'll start crying.

264
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,666
-Is that so, Mom?
-Don't be like that, Pur.

265
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,375
Go find your brother.

266
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,333
Sri, ma'am, Miss Pur.

267
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,083
Go ahead.

268
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,250
Come in.

269
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,083
Commander, someone's here for Mr. Broto.

270
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,708
-Bring them in.
-Huh?

271
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,625
-Dad.
-Jo.

272
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,541
Dad.

273
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,625
-Dad.
-Jo, that's enough.

274
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,041
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

275
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,125
Dad, please forgive me.

276
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,083
All right.

277
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,625
This is all my fault, Dad.
Everything's a mess.

278
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,625
You're suffering in this police station
because of me.

279
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,833
That's not true, Jo. It's fine.

280
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,458
It's fine.

281
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,583
I feel like a useless person, Dad.

282
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,041
Jo. Come here.

283
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,416
Get up. Come on.

284
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,916
You are my only son.

285
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,041
This is not how we solve problems.

286
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,916
I know you made a mistake,

287
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,375
but you have apologized for that.

288
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:48,500
Jo, when there's a problem, you face it.

289
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,208
You don't regret it.

290
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,291
Jo, the important thing to me is

291
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:02,041
you don't make the same mistake again.

292
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,000
That's it.

293
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,041
Yes. You can do it, right?

294
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:07,541
Yes, I can, Dad.

295
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,041
I won't repeat it, Dad.

296
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,000
Your mom and I are proud.

297
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,375
-Yes.
-All right. Come here.

298
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,375
All right,
we'll face this problem together.

299
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:38,375
I participated
in the selection event in Jakarta.

300
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,916
For the program in the Netherlands.

301
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:45,666
Sri.

302
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,166
I passed.

303
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:53,458
I was selected.

304
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,333
I leave in two weeks.

305
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,375
Congratulations.

306
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,458
Sri.

307
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,041
You and Menik are coming, right?

308
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,708
We'll talk about this later.

309
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,125
For now, let's help Mom prepare lunch.

310
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:28,041
Besides, there's something
I want to tell you about Dad and Tarjo.

311
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,375
Come on.

312
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:55,666
Mom.

313
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,000
Jo.

314
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,750
Please forgive me, Mom.

315
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,458
Why?

316
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:21,833
Oh my gosh!

317
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,833
Even though we will be apart,

318
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,833
I want our feelings to remain the same.

319
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,375
Good meaning?

320
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,416
I really like Atmo.

321
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:04,875
Atmo is my greatest love
in my whole world.

322
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,000
-You know, right?
-Really?

323
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:11,375
-Oh my gosh!
-Oh my gosh!

324
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:12,416
Atmo.

325
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
-Take picture together.
-Yes.

326
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,833
One, two, three.

327
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,083
My phone background.

328
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,625
-Wallpaper?
-Yeah.

329
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,875
Oh my God.

330
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,458
Ji Hae.

331
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:09,333
It's okay.

332
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:14,416
It's okay, Oppa. I know.

333
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,750
Have a safe trip.

334
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,416
I'm going to miss you.

335
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,458
I'm going to miss this guesthouse.

336
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,041
I'm going to miss everything here.

337
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:32,750
Also,

338
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:34,708
I…

339
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:39,083
will miss you the most.

340
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,166
Please be quick.

341
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,708
Come to Korea quickly.

342
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,416
Come to Korea soon, okay?

343
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,541
If you're happy,

344
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,000
I will be happy.

345
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:05,625
Even though… you'll be happy without me.

346
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,791
But you have to know something.

347
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,583
In Yogyakarta…

348
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:17,916
there will always be someone
who loves you sincerely.

349
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:17,875
I'm sorry, Sekar.

350
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:23,416
It's okay. What matters
is that you came to your senses.

351
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,666
I'm the dumbest person in the world.

352
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:38,708
You were blinded back then,
but you aren't entirely to blame.

353
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:43,416
But I feel sorry for Miss Anna too.

354
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,625
She's facing a tough problem.

355
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:50,750
Jo, it's not your responsibility
to fix her problems.

356
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,083
You should take care of your family now.

357
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,208
I still feel guilty towards my father.

358
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:07,875
And my mom.

359
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,708
I can fix all of this on my own.

360
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:15,458
The issue with Miss Anna, my thesis,

361
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,875
my thesis presentation, and TWS.

362
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,250
You don't have to face everything
on your own.

363
