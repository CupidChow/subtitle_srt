1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,041
Honey!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,541
I have an idea.

3
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,500
You gave me a fright.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm confident this idea will work wonders.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,166
-You mean for Sri and Jarot?
-Of course not!

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,875
This is for Tarjo and Anna.

7
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,416
Not too loud, please. Others will hear!

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,625
Well, come here and get closer
so I don't have to speak loudly.

9
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,500
Fine…

10
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,750
Good grief.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,166
What is it, honey? What's the idea?

12
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,500
It's like this.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,833
Why don't you talk to Sekar

14
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,458
and tell her to talk to Tarjo?

15
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,125
I don't think she wants to.

16
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:56,458
Come on, honey, this isn't about Anna.

17
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,916
-What is it about?
-Come on.

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:03,000
This is about Tarjo and Sekar's project.

19
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,000
As long as Tarjo sticks to Anna,

20
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,166
he couldn't care less
whether this project succeeds or not.

21
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,333
Even though he wanted this at first.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,291
-Right.
-Makes sense, right?

23
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,458
You can do it, right?

24
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:20,666
I guess so.

25
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,541
I'll try to call Sekar later.

26
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,291
Good.

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,791
CALLS

28
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:32,500
MRS. BROTO'S GUESTHOUSE

29
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:36,875
Morning.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,750
-Finished stretching?
-Yeah.

31
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:42,750
Where will we jog?

32
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,166
Just around here.

33
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,708
-Okay.
-Not too far.

34
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,000
What's with your hair? It's such a mess.

35
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,416
-Didn't you comb it?
-I've showered, and I smell nice.

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,333
Let's go.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,458
-Why are you behind me? Come here.
-Sure.

38
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,375
Honey, the towel.

39
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,666
LOSMEN BU BROTO: THE SERIES

40
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,000
Hello. Sekar?

41
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,416
How are you?

42
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,541
Yes, sorry for calling out of the blue.

43
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,083
I just want to ask…

44
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,875
Your project with Tarjo,

45
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,833
is it still in progress,
or are you having issues?

46
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,666
Are you sure you want to invest in TWS?

47
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,375
Yes, I'm sure.

48
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,375
Why… are you the one who's unsure?

49
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,916
Of course I want you to, but, Sekar…

50
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,958
What's your relationship with her?

51
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,833
Nothing.

52
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,833
We're just partners.

53
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,708
That's it?

54
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,041
Nothing more?

55
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,333
So what if we're more than that?

56
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,291
Well…

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
If you two are more than that…

58
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,083
I'd be upset.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,750
Please stop, sir.

60
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,833
PECEL ALA BLITAR

61
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,833
You're sweating.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,541
Was the pecel spicy?

63
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,250
Let's go, sir. Come on, hurry!

64
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,916
Yes. Wasn't it too spicy for you?

65
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,333
Listen up.

66
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,250
Earlier, I saw

67
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,958
Mr. Tarjo and Miss Anna on a date!

68
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,625
Don't gossip
about a married woman with another man,

69
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,750
especially because it's Mr. Tarjo.

70
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,208
You didn't see them.

71
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,708
They were extremely intimate!

72
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,541
Miss Anna was wiping the sweat
from Mr. Tarjo's forehead.

73
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,916
-Really?
-Really?

74
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,416
This is what happened.

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,375
It was like this…

76
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,625
Imagine this scene.

77
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,416
I was walking by…

78
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,208
How nice.

79
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,125
What are you chatting about?

80
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,125
Sounds exciting.

81
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,000
Well…

82
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,083
Korean dramas.

83
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,833
-Korean dramas.
-Yes, we're discussing Korean dramas.

84
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,125
-They're awesome, right?
-Yeah, amazing!

85
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,250
Excuse me. I have to boil water.

86
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,625
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Right.

87
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,541
I have to make the beds.

88
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:21,958
Excuse me.

89
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,000
What?

90
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,833
I have to go wash lemongrass.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,083
Excuse me, ma'am.

92
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,041
Don't lie to me.

93
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,375
I heard you talking
about Tarjo and Miss Anna.

94
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,666
What did you see?

95
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,625
Alas, this is my fate…

96
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,041
This is dawet,

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,750
traditional drink is Yogyakarta.

98
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,375
So what are you doing in Indonesia?

99
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,625
I have a problem in Korea.

100
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,083
If you have a problem,
feel free to tell me.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,125
Sorry, I can't tell you about it
right now.

102
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,625
But I'll tell you later.

103
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,666
It's okay.

104
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,791
Thank you for keeping me company.

105
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,708
Sekar.

106
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,083
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's okay.

107
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,541
Are we still on for the meeting?

108
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,625
No, I postponed it.

109
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,458
Why? I thought we had a meeting
with the Office of Tourism.

110
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,041
Our proposal isn't ready, Jo.

111
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,250
-There's still a lot of--
-Hey, Sekar.

112
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,000
-Can we talk for a second?
-Sure.

113
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,625
Hi, Jo.

114
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,708
Can we talk now?

115
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,750
Sekar.

116
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,416
Miss Anna and I were discussing TWS.

117
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,666
And?

118
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,875
And I think

119
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,833
she can become our first investor.

120
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,833
But if you don't agree,

121
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,291
at the very least,
she can be an informant.

122
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,583
I really need her perspective.

123
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:06,958
Okay.

124
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,625
Let's set up a meeting with her.

125
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,291
Okay.

126
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:36,875
Honey.

127
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,125
Honey.

128
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,541
-Let's talk about the Netherlands.
-Okay.

129
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,166
Well?

130
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,416
I've been thinking…

131
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:53,083
If I have to leave for the Netherlands…

132
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,625
When we come back home,
I'll have to start all over again.

133
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,541
My career, my job.

134
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:02,791
Sri.

135
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,625
Times have changed.

136
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,250
You can sing from anywhere.

137
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,416
You

138
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:19,291
can't think
that if we move to the Netherlands,

139
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,166
you'll have to give up your career.

140
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,791
It doesn't necessarily mean that.

141
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,375
Yes, I know that.

142
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:32,666
But my… support system is all here.

143
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,833
I can do both of them,

144
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,208
singing and raising Menik,

145
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,791
only because everything is here.

146
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,333
My mom, the guesthouse, Pur.

147
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,125
Everyone can help me.

148
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,916
But if we go to the Netherlands,
I'll be all alone.

149
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:56,750
I have no idea
how to juggle both on my own.

150
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,250
Who will accompany you in the Netherlands?

151
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,041
Me, right?

152
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,125
Don't you trust me?

153
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,958
Please don't be like that.
You're turning this into something else.

154
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,625
Why don't you go
to the Netherlands by yourself?

155
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,833
So we'll separate for a whole year?

156
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,458
So what if we do?

157
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,375
I can't imagine that.

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,583
Besides, your parents
will definitely not agree to that.

159
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,708
My parents don't get a say in this.

160
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,666
This is our family.

161
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,208
We have our own ways

162
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,208
to solve problems within our family.

163
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,791
And you said it yourself.

164
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,750
Times have changed.

165
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,041
Right?

166
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,666
Sekar.

167
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,166
How are you? Are you well?

168
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,666
Nice to see you again.

169
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,666
-Are you well?
-Yes, miss.

170
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,250
Come.

171
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,791
This is insane.

172
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,250
I'm sorry, Sekar. Were you waiting long?

173
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,333
Sorry. Tarjo had to wait for me.
I was taking a shower.

174
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,916
Mr. Par.

175
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,125
What is it, Yun?

176
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,125
Over there.

177
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,541
Please don't, Yun.

178
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,208
This is a public place. Plenty of people.

179
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,541
Watch your mouth! Over there, Mr. Tarjo.

180
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,208
My gosh, Tarjo.

181
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,625
He's taking
both the ripe and unripe mangoes.

182
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,458
Looks like a world war is coming.

183
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,916
Good grief.

184
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,875
-Yes.
-Nice.

185
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,708
He's just playing along.

186
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,833
-So, we--
-No need for that.

187
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,375
I trust Tarjo. And you.

188
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:47,000
Miss Anna, don't you want to see
the details of our plan first?

189
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,333
Just so you are aware
of the risks and opportunities…

190
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,541
No need.

191
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,625
What's happening?

192
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,458
-You scared us!
-What's up?

193
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,458
How much money do you need?

194
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,375
Listen, what if we do this
by profit sharing?

195
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,375
I don't think so. How about a loan?

196
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,166
We can't do that, miss.
TWS is only a university project.

197
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,000
We can't afford to take on a loan.

198
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,125
You don't sound confident
about your own project.

199
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,791
-Let me just ask the founder.
-I'm also the cofounder, miss.

200
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,458
Go, Miss Sekar!

201
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,291
Yes, Sekar is also a co-founder.

202
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,541
What's your objective in this project?

203
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,916
Is it because you love traveling,

204
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,041
or do you like Tarjo?

205
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,416
Miss Anna is about to lose it!

206
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,583
What about you?
Why are you investing in TWS?

207
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,833
Because you like business,

208
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:57,833
or you like Tarjo?

209
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,250
-Damn, girl!
-Preach! You go, girl!

210
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,458
Good for you!

211
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,666
Mind your words.

212
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,625
How about you mind your words?

213
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,416
Oh my!

214
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,416
You behave like a teenager!

215
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,416
Yeah! Queen slay!

216
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,458
Miss, hold on a minute.

217
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,458
-Sekar!
-What is wrong with you?

218
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:30,916
Damn it!

219
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,458
-Mister.
-Mister!

220
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,666
Batik. Originally made here in Yogyakarta.

221
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,416
Asli, you know?

222
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,833
-Got any snack, Pur?
-Sure.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,583
Here, I'll get it.

224
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,166
Here you go.

225
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,875
Jo, I'm concerned.

226
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,500
People are talking about you.

227
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,125
Talking about what?

228
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,000
There's nothing going on.

229
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,916
What if Mom or Dad hears about it?

230
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,750
-Sri.
-Yes, sir?

231
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,708
Did you get Kirana's single?

232
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,958
Yes, I received it.

233
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,291
It's good. Definitely Kirana's style.

234
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,666
Are you in a rush to leave?

235
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,500
Yes, I am. What's up, sir?

236
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,166
I just want to tell you something.

237
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,250
You know that Putra from Afternoon Rain
is coming to Yogyakarta?

238
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,625
Yes, I know. And?

239
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,083
I gave him a demo of your song.

240
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,208
After listening to it,
he was instantly interested in producing.

241
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,125
-Yeah.
-Are you serious?

242
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,875
He's currently working with
a record label.

243
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,750
So there will be some requirements.

244
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,458
What requirements?

245
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,625
Sri.

246
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,500
Sri.

247
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,416
Sri.

248
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,833
What happened earlier?

249
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,708
Why didn't you come?

250
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,458
Honey.

251
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,708
I got an offer to work with
a record label.

252
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,666
But this time,

253
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,875
they're giving me
a lot of creative freedom.

254
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,958
From music production to marketing,

255
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,500
I can be heavily involved.

256
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,250
This is a big break for me.

257
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,583
Now you're the one…
who's making decisions on your own.

258
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:44,500
Friends, let's play outside

259
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:50,708
The moonlight is a bright as dawn

260
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:59,041
The moon is calling

261
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:03,666
Reminding not to sleep…

262
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,041
Wait…

263
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,541
Mo.

264
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:10,875
Talk to her, Mo.

265
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,541
Don't…

266
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,416
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,208
I…

268
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,416
What?

269
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,958
I don't understand what she's saying, sir.

270
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,791
Ji Hae has a fiancé in Korea.

271
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,750
Sorry.

272
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,083
Ji Hae.

273
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,208
Hey, are you ready?

274
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,000
Are you ready?

275
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,541
-Yeah. Atmo.
-Oh, Atmo. Gosh.

276
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,291
Ji Hae wants to say goodbye to you.

277
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,375
Mo. At…

278
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,500
Atmo!

279
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:54,916
Good grief!

280
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,041
It's no use. He won't open the door.

281
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,375
He hasn't come out since last night.

282
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,333
I feel sorry for Ji Hae.

283
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,333
She wants to see Atmo.

284
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,375
All right.

285
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,208
I'll say goodbye to her for you, okay?

286
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:13,833
Let's go.

287
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,416
-Mo!
-Let's go.

288
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,416
Where's Ji Hae?

289
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,083
Ji Hae.

290
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,541
-This is…
-My gosh!

291
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,833
-This is bad.
-How should I tell her?

292
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,875
Just tell her that Atmo is busy.

293
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:27,833
Ji Hae.

294
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,083
Atmo is busy right now. Sibuk.

295
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:36,916
Oh no.

296
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,791
-Mr. Par.
-She's sad.

297
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,541
Wait.

298
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:52,958
Mr. Par.

299
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,375
For the next few days,
I'm going to rely on you.

300
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,791
I can't count on Mr. Atmo.

301
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,083
A part of his soul has gone.

302
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,666
This afternoon, I have to--

303
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,916
Stop it.

304
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I can only handle
one heartbreak for today.

305
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,833
Not you too, please.

306
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,708
Fine.

307
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:11,833
Thank you.

308
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,875
Keep going.

309
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,750
Okay.

310
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:36,958
Who is it?

311
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,541
Just a second.

312
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,541
Hey.

313
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,750
I finished a new chapter.

314
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,375
Can you read it?

315
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,791
Shouldn't we do this outside?

316
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,375
Why? What's wrong?

317
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,625
You're too far.
You won't be able to see. Come closer.

318
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:43,875
Miss.

319
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:49,041
I've never done this before.

320
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,625
Miss.

321
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,458
I feel uncomfortable.

322
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:27,958
So what's missing?

323
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:31,541
We have a group tour tomorrow.
They're asking for the itinerary, ma'am.

324
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:32,833
Tarjo has it, right?

325
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,083
-Go ask him.
-Yes, ma'am.

326
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,750
-Are the others okay?
-All good.

327
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,000
Jo, come here.

328
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,833
I'm in a hurry. I have to go to campus.

329
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,500
Just a minute. Hold on.

330
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,500
The guest itinerary for tomorrow?

331
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,833
It's in my room, on my desk.

332
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,250
All right, I'm off, Mom.

333
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,208
I have to attend thesis guidance.

334
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,375
-What is it?
-Hey, take care.

335
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,458
I will.

336
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,958
-Yun.
-Yes, ma'am?

337
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,500
Any other information?

338
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,166
About what?

339
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,333
About Tarjo.

340
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,750
None so far, ma'am.

341
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:16,791
If you hear anything, anything at all,
report to me. Via chat.

342
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,250
Got it, Ma'am. The group chat, right?

343
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,208
Don't you dare! I'll punish you.

344
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,250
-I know. I was kidding.
-Stop it.

345
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,708
Hey, Tarjo.

346
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,250
-Long time no see.
-Where's Sekar?

347
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,208
I don't know.

348
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,250
I haven't seen her these past two days.

349
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,958
TOUR ITINERARY

350
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:08,916
How should we approach Tarjo
and talk about this?

351
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:50,541
I thought you liked me

352
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,875
Let me see. What is this for?

353
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,208
What is this?

354
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,750
A bird.

355
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,541
A bird.

356
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,291
This is Daddy.

357
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,958
This is Mommy. And this…

358
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,583
When I was deeply in love

359
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:17,083
My heart was filled with misery

360
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:29,791
Did I misunderstand?

361
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:39,166
I poured my heart out too deeply

362
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,583
Instead, I got hurt

363
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:48,708
I can't bear to face it

364
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:56,125
It hurts that you left me

365
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:07,041
My heart isn't as strong as Mount Merapi

366
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,750
It's easily crushed, easily melts

367
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:16,500
When it's only been pain

368
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:21,666
This memory has been buried

369
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,125
Deep in my heart

370
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:29,750
I can't possibly forget

371
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:34,000
Because you're the one I love

372
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,583
Mr. Atmo.

373
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,333
-Son of a--
-What? I'm a bitch?

374
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,083
Uh-huh.

375
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,000
Hey!

376
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,958
-How dare you!
-You scared me, Yun.

377
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,750
Here, I brought you
fried bananas and coffee

378
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:11,000
to accompany you while you're daydreaming
about the one who has left for Korea.

379
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Fried bananas don't go well with coffee.

380
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,625
I've been daydreaming about Ji Hae,
who's a Korean.

381
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,125
I should eat Korean food.

382
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,541
Sembab and tabokin.

383
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,333
Then drink soju.

384
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:28,500
"Tabokin," my ass!

385
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:31,333
It's kimbap and tteokbokki.

386
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,041
Stop acting like you enjoy that food.

387
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,166
All right, eat it all.

388
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:39,375
To give you energy for your daydreams.

389
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,375
Tarjo.

390
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:54,916
Jo.

391
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,541
-Yes?
-Where have you been?

392
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,416
I had to take care of something.

393
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:04,541
So that something…

394
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,375
is it done?

395
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,875
Don't. People will see.

396
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,333
I don't see anyone.

397
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,250
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

398
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,541
But the entire guesthouse
is talking about us.

399
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,458
You don't have to listen to them.

400
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:26,583
They don't know the truth.

401
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:27,791
What is the truth?

402
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,375
Okay, let's discuss this in your room.

403
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,083
No, miss.

404
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,375
It's inappropriate.

405
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,583
Are you toying with me, Jo?

406
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:45,041
What do you want?

407
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,083
You knew that I had a husband
from the beginning.

408
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,250
But you didn't mind being with me.

409
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:59,375
It's not fair
for you to make it an issue now.

410
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:03,500
You're the one who crossed a line,
but you're the one bothered?

411
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:08,583
Be honest with me.

412
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,125
You have feelings for me, right?

413
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:15,041
So what if I do?

414
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,791
-What can we do?
-I can leave Jody.

415
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,708
Are you serious?

416
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,000
That's a question for you.

417
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,833
Are you serious?

418
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:10,416
Sekar, I'll call you back later. Thanks.

419
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,083
What's up with you and Jarot this time?

420
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:30,833
I don't know what to do about
our relationship anymore, Mom.
