It seems that after the mokbingo was discovered,

it became difficult to smuggle alcohol into the capital.

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,410
All the main and minor gates are blocked.

170
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,700
Gye Sang Mok's distillery is destroyed

171
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,830
and your house has already been searched.

172
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,200
We have prepared a ship, so come with us.

173
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,050
If you delay any longer, you won't be able to leave Hanyang altogether.

174
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,710
To where?

175
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,810
It's my first time leaving Hanyang.

176
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,000
My Lady, we are not going on a field trip.

177
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,990
Please go back to your home now.

178
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,960
I told you I ran away.

179
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,160
I do not have a home now.

180
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,010
Maiden Kang, let us go to Gaesong.

181
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,260
Do you not want to see Gaesong if we are on the run anyway?

182
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,470
I must deliver the news to Inspector Nam.

183
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,350
I think you better not.

184
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,130
They say if one does not report you knowing your crimes,

185
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,520
that person will be punished the same.

186
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,440
And he's an inspector.

187
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,950
We should be thankful that he is turning a blind eye on us.

188
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,450
Then, what about Woon Sim?

189
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,490
If we tell Woon Sim where we are going—

190
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,340
There is 100 nyang reward on your neck, My Lady.

191
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,070
Do not trust anyone...

192
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,640
and do not tell anyone. That is the best way to leave.

193
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,050
Maiden.

194
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,660
I think you better listen to them.

195
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,080
Will you wait for me?

196
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,030
Until I get everything in order

197
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,010
and return?

198
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,780
How could this be possible?

199
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,350
We have a map and a structural plan.

200
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,450
How can we still say that the merchant did not do this?

201
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,060
[Inspector General]
Where are the map and the structural plan right now?

202
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,330
- Inspector Nam took them with the report to the King—
- Then...

203
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,560
where is that report?

204
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,350
With Inspector Nam...

205
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,630
Then where is Inspector Nam?

206
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,780
Well, Inspector Nam...

207
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,020
Goodness.

208
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,980
Missing work without permission. What in the world?

209
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,380
If he is so disgruntled, tell Inspector Nam to come see me in person.

210
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,750
Where did he go? He said he was leaving to submit the report.

211
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,780
He would never miss work without permission, though.

212
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,600
- No.
- Never.

213
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,860
Was he too shocked about his engagement being called off?

214
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,860
He actually looked happier, though.

215
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,240
Right?

216
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Something isn't right.

217
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,960
Eunuch Kim.

218
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,510
His Highness asks for Inspector Nam urgently.

219
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,850
We are also looking for that Inspector Nam.

220
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,040
Pardon?

221
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,820
Chief Inspector!

222
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,790
There is trouble!

223
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,620
Inspector Nam...

224
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,700
Move aside!

225
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,110
The crabs and crawfish must have bitten his face off.

226
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,740
It is difficult to identify the face.

227
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,210
His clothes and valuables have been stolen.

228
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,900
[Nam Young]

229
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,800
[Nam Young]

230
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,660
Inspector Nam!

231
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,970
Inspector Nam!

232
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,390
Inspector Nam!

233
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,510
Did you not say that you were visiting the grave of your father?

234
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,100
I thought you would return tomorrow.

235
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,510
[Queen Yeon/Yeon Jo Moon's granddaughter]
The scene outside the palace seemed unusually suspicious,

236
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,010
so I returned earlier than planned.

237
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,720
The scene outside the palace seems suspicious?

238
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,020
The guards of the Prohibition Bureau are harassing noblewomen

239
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,060
on the grounds of finding a criminal.

240
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,400
Those men are no different from street thugs.

241
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,200
How could you assign them with matters of the nation?

242
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,960
So that was it?

243
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,570
The Prohibition Bureau is the problem.

244
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,790
Is that what Chief State Minister ordered you to say?

245
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,010
I am only speaking my mind.

246
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,690
This is why I keep my distance from you.

247
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,090
Leave now!

248
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,150
I feel suffocated sitting here with you.

249
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,480
- Your Majesty.
- Chief Royal Secretary.

250
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,470
What is it?

251
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,970
Inspector Nam's corpse has been discovered.

252
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,270
What do you mean, corpse?

253
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,500
Are you saying he is dead?

254
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,940
[Yeon Jo Moon]
Will His Highness be able to succeed the throne safely,

255
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,180
and secure his place on it?

256
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,590
Are you using the Crown Prince

257
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,690
to threaten me right now?

258
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,640
He threatened me in regards to the Crown Prince...

259
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,890
Is this what he meant?

260
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,600
Is he trying to kill the Crown Prince and all his people?

261
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,900
Your Majesty.

262
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,830
This time around!

263
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,760
I will not idly sit back and watch.

264
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,020
Your Majesty.

265
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,610
Please...

266
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,980
you must return to the Queen's Palace, Your Highness.

267
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,600
If you stay here, his illness will worsen.

268
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,990
Do not use the heart of the father who lost his child...

269
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,840
Chief Royal Secretary.

270
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,480
Summon the royal physician.

271
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,920
The Queen is not entirely wrong.

272
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,420
Making guards out of thugs

273
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,830
will only create a disorderly mob.

274
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,550
There is enough justification now.

275
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,300
First, hold them responsible for digging the tunnel

276
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,350
and reduce the budget and workforce of the Capital Defense Military.

277
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,370
Then, there will be enough budget to station armed soldiers

278
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,900
within the Prohibition Bureau.

279
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,610
Hurry.

280
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,130
I do not think my body will endure much longer.

281
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

282
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,460
When is it coming?

283
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,280
It's coming!

284
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,480
Where?

285
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,400
The boat's coming in!

286
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,530
Anyone getting on board, get ready.

287
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,860
Hey, hey, hey.

288
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,500
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

289
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,960
- That inspector died.
- What? What inspector?

290
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,890
You know, that... you know...

291
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,480
The countryside inspector, who was set to marry the daughter of the Minister of Defense.

292
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,570
Aigoo.

293
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,940
I thought he had a bright future ahead of him.

294
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,550
This is how a person's fate changes overnight.

295
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,970
You're right.

296
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,500
- So you should all—
- Goodness!

297
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,080
What do you mean?

298
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,290
W-what?

299
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,390
You said the inspector died.

300
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,690
Is that true?

301
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,870
I, uh...

302
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,870
Never mind. Get on the boat first.

303
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,370
- I asked if that is true!
- My Lady!

304
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,030
K-Kang Ro Seo.

305
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,120
Here! Here is Kang Ro Seo!

306
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,500
What is the name of that inspector?

307
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,920
- Do you know the name of that inspector?
- My Lady!

308
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,660
- Mak San!
-M-Mom.

309
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,010
That inspector! What do you mean he died?

310
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,050
- My Lady.
- The inspector...

311
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,420
He's dead... The inspector...

312
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,610
Go!

313
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,840
Kang Ro Seo goes there!

314
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,850
What? Oh, yes.

315
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,050
W-who's Kang Ro Seo?

316
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,130
I-I am Kang Ro Seo!

317
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,370
Catch her!

318
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,160
Catch her!

319
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,590
Gosh.

320
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,590
Never mind.

321
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,140
Cover him.

322
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,030
[Nam Young]

323
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,160
[Nam Young]

324
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,250
There is no way...

325
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,850
That cannot be true.

326
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,000
That's...

327
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,670
Right, Geum?

328
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,600
That isn't true, right?

329
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,400
The identification tag...

330
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,580
said it's Inspector Nam.

331
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,590
No.

332
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,730
No. Something has to be wrong.

333
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,940
I must go for myself and see.

334
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,220
Where do you think you're going?

335
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,660
Let me go!

336
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,480
- We must stop her.
- Maiden.

337
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,090
My Lady, no!

338
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,360
If you go, you will die, too.

339
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,310
He must be waiting for me.

340
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,070
He asked me to come and see him.

341
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,090
He asked me to come and see him...

342
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,730
What do I do?

343
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,220
Let me go!

344
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,090
Let me go!

345
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,620
Look.

346
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,940
Look at this.

347
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,540
I made this.

348
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,220
Well made, right?

349
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,760
I actually...

350
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,680
wanted to give this to my daughter.

351
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,840
I'm sure she would understand.

352
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,690
Here.

353
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,440
You must not come out of this space.

354
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,550
You!

355
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,250
You...

356
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,810
Do you recognize me?

357
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,160
Why have you locked me up in here?

358
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,740
I did not lock you up. I saved you.

359
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,450
Young Master!

360
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,620
C-Choon Gae.

361
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,950
- Choon Gae.
- Young Master!

362
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,560
Aigoo. I thought you had died.

363
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,840
Oh, aigoo...

364
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,330
Are you all right?

365
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,960
They will think you are dead.

366
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,890
It will be tricky if there is no corpse,

367
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,570
so I have made the necessary preparations.

368
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,460
It will earn you some time.

369
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,480
Earn some time?

370
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,510
For you to find Lady Kang.

371
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,700
The wanted posters with her face on them are all over the streets.

372
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,170
She is known as the ring leader of the alcohol smuggling group

373
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,170
and there is a 100-nyang reward for her.

374
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,100
How could that be...

375
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,590
Where is she now?

376
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,880
No one is able to find her just yet.

377
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,620
Perhaps she is somewhere safe.

378
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,070
If she has not left Hanyang yet,

379
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,170
she must have heard the news of your death about now.

380
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,230
Are you not looking forward to it?

381
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,300
What would Lady Kang do now that she heard that you are dead?

382
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,700
You...

383
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,600
What are your true intentions?

384
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,250
True intentions?

385
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,020
How sad to hear you say that.

386
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,360
I am on Lady Kang's side.

387
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,700
So please find her first for me.

388
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,880
Make sure she's not hurt at all. Not even a hair on her body.

389
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,700
Get off.

390
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,700
Come here.

391
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,640
This way.

392
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,330
What is this?

393
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,270
I think I've been here before.

394
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,200
I think I've seen this face before, too.

395
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,430
Let's go!

396
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,810
Right?

397
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,650
We've met before, right?

398
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,090
I think I'm right.

399
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,960
Ow, that's hot!

400
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,500
- Your Highness, I will do it.
- No, no.

401
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,960
It's all right.

402
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,790
Please taste this.

403
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,350
I have grilled it myself.

404
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,390
Here.

405
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,450
What is so exciting that you would grill meat?

406
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,800
The dead is dead.

407
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,430
The living must live.

408
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,250
This is why when Hyungnim passed away,

409
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:03,580
people said you were excited and grilled meat.

410
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,070
Then...

411
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,620
what am I supposed to do?

412
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,500
I was worried that you might stop eating

413
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,580
and follow after Crown Prince Sunghyun.

414
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,910
If that happened,

415
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,000
how would I go on as your mother?

416
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,910
Nam Young is dead.

417
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,480
I do not even know

418
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,490
what happened to that girl or where she is.

419
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,150
But I...

420
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,880
as the Crown Prince of this nation...

421
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,570
I am trapped in here, unable to do anything.

422
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,910
What did I do to deserve eating meat?

423
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,300
Your Highness.

424
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,490
[Office of Inspector General]

425
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,220
Chief Inspector, yes?

426
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,140
You are as handsome as they say.

427
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,540
And you are so manly.

428
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,940
Me?

429
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,840
This way, please.

430
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,210
Let me go.

431
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,880
Hold on.

432
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,460
W-what...

433
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,700
Officer Hwang, let us leave.

434
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,020
Yes.

435
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,010
Inspector Nam!

436
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,280
How could this be...

437
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,070
You died...

438
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,610
Y-you...

439
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,010
You are alive!

440
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,890
I must ask you both

441
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,110
to help me.

442
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,470
His Majesty is distraught about the recent events.

443
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,650
Yes. That is understandable.

444
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,490
I noticed you had not yet submitted the Princess Consort candidate list.

445
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,060
Have you changed your mind?

446
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,410
Goodness. N-not at all.

447
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,160
I will submit it. Certainly.

448
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,150
If everything goes as planned,

449
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,800
your daughter will become the Princess Consort.

450
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,520
As planned...

451
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,490
As long as everything goes as planned.

452
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,620
Is there something you are concerned about?

453
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,860
Pardon?

454
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:39,790
Well, unfortunate events keep occurring.

455
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,870
I just wonder how the world is going to turn out.

456
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,040
Anyhow,

457
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,740
how is it going with capturing that ringleader of the alcohol smugglers?

458
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,880
Oh, yes. We are working hard to find her.

459
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,630
It is a mystery where she disappeared to.

460
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,710
Just wait until we find you.

461
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,560
My Lady, you are standing out too much. We have to be natural.

462
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,500
She has back pains.

463
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,270
There is no doubt about it. They are soldiers from the Ministry of Defense.

464
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,880
They are lifting all the girls with cover skirts over their heads.

465
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,230
There is no way for us to get in, My Lady.

466
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,220
It doesn't matter if there is a way or not.

467
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,620
I will go in even if I have to climb the wall.

468
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,320
All of you, go ahead and leave.

469
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,650
I will manage on my own.

470
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,460
- I will come with you.
- I can't leave without you either, My Lady.

471
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,890
I didn't want to leave until I caught him anyway.

472
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,120
You are all going to go into the capital?

473
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,420
Maiden Han, you should go home.

474
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,260
I don't want to. I told you I ran away.

475
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,930
Do you think this is a joke?

476
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,230
If someone like you is with us,

477
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,050
what will they think of us?

478
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,240
That's right.

479
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,200
We could all be in trouble.

480
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,170
Trouble?

481
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,550
Now that I think about it,

482
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,400
Maiden, you are the daughter of the Minister of Defense.

483
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,080
So?

484
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,150
I am the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers.

485
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,080
The daughter of the Minister of Defense

486
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,810
and the ringleader of alcohol smugglers.

487
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,340
What?

488
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,000
We do not know what she will do.

489
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,710
What do you mean by that?

490
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,440
Just as I said, we do not know what she will do.

491
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,760
She is the most reckless in Joseon.

492
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,600
We must capture her before she does anything.

493
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,450
Before the Ministry of Defense, the Prohibition Bureau, and Merchant Sim catch her.

494
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,050
Are you asking us to forge the Ministry of Defense pass

495
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,500
and help someone who smuggles alcohol into the capital?

496
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,600
They say anyone who hides the criminal or does not report her intentionally

497
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,300
will be punished just the same.

498
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,490
We have Han Ae Jin, the daughter of the Minister of Defense!

499
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,630
The moment you move a finger,

500
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,030
we will take that as a sign to kill his daughter.

501
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,690
[Kang Ro Seo]

502
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,230
- It's Kang Ro Seo!
- Kang Ro Seo.

503
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,330
Kang Ro Seo.

504
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,820
Kang Ro Seo?

505
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,280
Whoa, whoa, you just moved.

506
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,830
If I die, I will tell Father it was because of you.

507
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,240
Stay put.

508
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,940
You are not acting like a kidnapped person at all.

509
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,380
Just cry. Cry.

510
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,940
Over there! You!

511
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,070
You moved.

512
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,350
Come here.

513
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,600
Put two hands high in the air and walk this way slowly.

514
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,720
Slowly. Up to here.

515
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,100
Wait, wait.

516
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,900
Wait.

517
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,980
What are you doing?

518
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,030
I found it.

519
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,710
Send this to Father.

520
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,070
I'm finished.

521
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,310
[To Father]

522
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,550
Now return to your place.

523
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,890
Go!

524
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,190
Do not move.

525
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,540
No one move!

526
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,780
- Don't move!
- No one move.

527
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,030
Don't move! Back off.

528
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,470
Come on.

529
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:01,920
You!

530
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,640
Don't move.

531
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,200
Stay still.

532
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,760
Minister of Defense!

533
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,700
Minister of Defense.

534
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,210
Lady Ae Jin was...

535
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,110
What about Ae Jin?

536
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,620
Where is she now?

537
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,940
She was kidnapped by Kang Ro Seo.

538
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,220
She was what?

539
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,780
This is a letter Her Ladyship asked to deliver to you.

540
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,910
Father.

541
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,150
I have been captured by the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers.

542
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,840
These people are insane.

543
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,150
There are hundreds of viscous individuals,

544
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,940
and they are armed with hundreds of guns and explosives.

545
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,460
There will be sever consequences if you do not take them seriously.

546
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,590
They may hurt me if the Ministry of Defense even attempts to arrest them,

547
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:06,680
so you must never, never take any action.

548
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,320
And...

549
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,920
please do not think to make me into a Princess Consort.

550
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,700
Sincerely, Ae Jin.

551
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,770
Aigoo.

552
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,140
Aigoo, Ae Jin.

553
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,300
Aigoo, aigoo.

554
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,090
You are all working so hard for my brother.

555
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,890
I cannot stand to sit back and watch.

556
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,490
Come on and eat.

557
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,550
You over there, come and eat.

558
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,950
It is all right.

559
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,830
Guard your places.

560
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,270
All right then...

561
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,390
I suppose there is nothing to be done.

562
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:06,090
I personally made this fruit salad and brought it all the way to the Eastern Palace.

563
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,830
Mere guards looked down on me

564
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,790
and did not even touch my food...

565
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,120
I suppose His Majesty...

566
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,610
will hear of this...

567
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,620
We are honored to eat them.

568
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,170
Why did you not say so earlier?

569
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,410
Eat up, all of you.

570
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,140
Enjoy, everyone.

571
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,320
Your Highness!

572
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,590
What...

573
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:03,420
I heard the daughter of the Minister of Defense was kidnapped.

574
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,110
One shout from them, and the soldiers couldn't do anything!

575
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,010
Aigoo.

576
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,280
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

577
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,650
I hear they have the power to control space and time.

578
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,030
Aigoo, that's nonsense.

579
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,560
They're not Hong Gil Dong*.
(A heroic fictional Korean character)

580
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,960
But if her face is on the wanted poster,

581
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,830
she should have run away from the capital.

582
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,980
Why did she come back inside?

583
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,550
That's true.

584
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,290
Why did she come inside?

585
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,850
Oh, welcome!

586
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,460
Aigoo, welcome.

587
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,380
The talk of the Minister of Defense's daughter being kidnapped by the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers

588
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,610
is stirring everyone up in the streets.

589
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,260
Why did Maiden Ro Seo and Ae Jin have to be together?

590
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,110
They are the worst pair.

591
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,060
You did say there was no way of knowing what she would do, but...

592
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,940
Kidnapping the daughter of the Minister...

593
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,160
There is no going back from this.

594
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,190
Are we doomed?

595
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,190
We must hurry.

596
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,580
Before she causes a bigger mess.

597
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,460
Will it really be all right?

598
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,970
Don't worry.

599
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,330
I have the Doyenne and Mak San with me.

600
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,870
The soldiers won't be able to make any moves because of Maiden Ae Jin,

601
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,250
but Sim Heon will certainly show up.

602
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,900
He must have heard about us since we caused all that commotion getting into the capital.

603
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,040
That is why we followed you.

604
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,270
He will certainly show up.

605
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,830
Just you wait. I'll make a bullet hole in his forehead.

606
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,720
So...

607
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,910
what about me?

608
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,420
What should I do?

609
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,150
Maiden...

610
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,520
you can just stay put.

611
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,110
I want to do it, too. I can cause a distraction.

612
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:32,100
We may have lost the money, but now we have the tunnel as our justification.

613
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:36,230
And now that Inspector Nam is dead, all we have to do is capture Kang Ro Seo.

614
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,520
Capture Kang Ro Seo and bring her to me. Then...

615
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:43,170
once the Prohibition Bureau becomes a military camp,

616
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,670
you shall earn a position there.

617
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,650
Yes, sir.

618
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,010
The preparations are finished, Minister.

619
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,900
All right. Let us depart.

620
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,190
Yes, sir.

621
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,000
- Depart!
- Yes, sir!

622
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:23,330
I don't think this is right.

623
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,250
Come on, do not worry.

624
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,480
All you have to do is take me to Gaesong after all this is over.

625
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,600
Gaesong? Why Gaesong?

626
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,450
Do not ask further.

627
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:36,960
What about you, My Lady?

628
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,840
What will you do now?

629
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,050
I can't trust the rumors until I see for myself.

630
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,670
I must go to the Office of Inspector General.

631
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,100
Aigoo! Aigoo, Young Master!

632
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,000
How can you leave me like this?

633
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,480
Aigoo.

634
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,030
Aigoo.

635
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,780
Aigoo, Young Master.

636
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,230
Aigoo.

637
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,700
There's Kang Ro Seo!

638
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,600
- Capture her!
- Yes, sir!

639
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,410
- Aigoo!
- Stop right there!

640
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,300
Aigoo.

641
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,530
Aigoo.

642
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,030
Aigoo...

643
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,400
Catch her!

644
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,980
Stop right there!

645
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:03,260
Stop right there!

646
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,570
What's going on?

647
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,630
What's the commotion?

648
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:10,090
- Move aside!
- Stop her!

649
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,450
Kang Ro Seo!

650
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:13,930
Catch her!

651
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:16,470
Stop her!

652
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,840
Stop right there!

653
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,240
Stop right there!

654
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,400
Stop her!

655
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,800
Stop right there!

656
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,050
Stop right there!

657
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,840
Let her go.

658
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,780
Before I cut your arm off.

659
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,510
Get behind me.

660
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,370
Goodness!

661
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,770
Officer Hwang?

662
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,260
Stop right there!

663
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,720
Move aside!

664
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,500
Stop right there!

665
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,950
Stop right there!

666
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,820
I told no one to come inside!

667
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:42,100
G-goodness, Inspector N-Nam!

668
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,570
What...

669
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:46,460
Y-you are not dead?

670
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,270
There is something more shocking

671
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:51,500
than the dead rising from his grave.

672
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,940
W-what are you talking about?

673
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,330
The one who stole the military seal

674
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,150
is Maiden Ae Jin.

675
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,540
W-what...

676
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,360
What did you say?

677
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,030
If you think back on it, there must have been clues.

678
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,650
Did she ever suddenly visit the Ministry of Defense?

679
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,220
Aigoo, how wonderful!

680
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,050
- Oh, my!
- No, it's okay.

681
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,470
Could she...

682
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,680
If this knowledge gets out, no noble family will agree

683
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,830
to a marriage with Maiden Ae Jin, much less become a Princess Consort.

684
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:33,600
If you do as I say,

685
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,770
I shall bring Maiden Ae Jin safely back home

686
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,090
and convince her so that she wants to become

687
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,710
the Princess Consort.

688
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,710
Not that one.

689
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,800
This one.

690
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:01,320
Aigoo, Young Master.

691
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,280
- There's Kang Ro Seo!
- Capture her!

692
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,110
- Yes, Sir!
- Stop right there!

693
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,030
That way!

694
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,020
Stop right there!

695
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,990
Minister of Defense.

696
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:24,730
What has happened?

697
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,460
We pretended to chase her for a while, then gave up.

698
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,300
That is enough.

699
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,920
Tell everyone to withdraw.

700
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,100
How dare you touch a lady!

701
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,010
Maiden Ae Jin?

702
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,320
Young Master Lee Chui Joong?

703
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,970
Your Highness.

704
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,520
Your H...

705
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,290
Geez.

706
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,310
- Move!
- Your Highness!

707
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,030
Move aside! What are you all doing?

708
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,770
S***.

709
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,560
Do they think they're the only ones who can climb rooftops?

710
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,800
Hey!

711
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,400
You can't do this? You can't?

712
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,010
You can't do this?

713
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:54,400
♫ I fill the world with the shining stars up above ♫

714
00:57:54,410 --> 00:58:00,500
♫ I wanna be your star ♫

715
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,230
♫ Your footsteps fade ♫

716
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,050
Your Highness!

717
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,710
♫ I'm running, fly ♫

718
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,960
Aigoo, aigoo.

719
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,370
Young Master!

720
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:19,590
How could you go before me?

721
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,750
Young Master!

722
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,350
Aigoo... aigoo...

723
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
I heard the inspector died.

724
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,580
I hear he even won the state exam.

725
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,520
Then why did he die?

726
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:40,810
Aigoo, Young Master.

727
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:44,670
Young Master.

728
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:53,550
Aigoo... Young Master...

729
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,310
Goodness!

730
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,840
Aigoo, Young Master!

731
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:14,860
How resentful your soul must be, not being able to pass in peace, Young Master...

732
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,460
Aigoo! Young Master!

733
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,700
How resentful you must be!

734
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,290
Aigoo, Young Master!

735
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:30,030
How resentful you must be that you can't go in peace...

736
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:34,100
Aigoo, Young Master!

737
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,190
I caught you.

738
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,430
Aigoo, Young Master!

739
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,270
Will you leave me like this?

740
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,830
Aigoo, Young Master!

741
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,090
Aigoo.

742
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:16,090
Aigoo.

743
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,560
Aigoo.

744
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,900
Aigoo.

745
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,620
Aigoo.

746
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,520
Aigoo.

747
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:38,280
Young Master. Aigoo...

748
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,040
Aigoo. Aigoo.

749
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,630
Young Master, how can you go before me?

750
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,690
Aigoo.

751
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:52,720
Aigoo.

752
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,030
Aigoo.

753
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,700
Aigoo, Young Master!

754
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,880
How resentful your soul must be, not being able to pass in peace, Young Master...

755
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,510
Aigoo, Young Master!

756
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,680
I caught you.

757
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:51,110
♫ I cannot explain this ♫

758
01:01:51,110 --> 01:02:00,400
♫ You held my trembling hand without a word ♫

759
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:06,020
♫ You excited my meaningless life ♫

760
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:15,160
♫ You approached me while making my heart flutter ♫

761
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:20,960
♫ My heart is searching for you ♫

762
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:28,620
♫ Your world is coloring my heart ♫

763
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,810
♫ I say, who you are ♫

764
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:33,710
[Moonshine]

765
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,050
It is Maiden Ro Seo's.

766
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,000
She said something about it belonging to her father.

767
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,310
He seemed somewhat uncomfortable with me.

768
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:42,890
We cannot sit idle at times like this.

769
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:45,330
Aren't my lips too red?

770
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,990
It means you should make your mark on him with those red lips.

771
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:50,840
Her Ladyship cannot live an ordinary noble life.

772
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,090
Young Master, you know that better than anyone.

773
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,990
You will have to give up everything.

774
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:57,510
Family.

775
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,810
Honor.

776
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,190
And even your life.

777
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,050
Why do you not come home?

778
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,930
As though you are avoiding me.

779
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:07,760
Come to the Underwater Palace with me and drink this sweet crimson liquor.

780
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,850
I shall make you a woman of extremely high status.

781
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,460
Forgive me.

782
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:15,350
Do not go to the Underwater Palace.

783
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:18,690
♫ You shined the light upon me ♫
