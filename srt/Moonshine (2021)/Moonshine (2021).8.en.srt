You aren't even taking half of the payment

Well... that is...

168

If they are in their right mind,

169

would they not have run away from the capital?

170

How dare you!

171

reported that they saw such bandits.

173

They must still be inside the capital.

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,190
Had the guards of Capital Defense Military had their eyes open properly,

that would be the case.

What did you say, Chief Royal Secretary?

177
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,480
There are almost 10,000 guards in the capital.

178
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,630
How could it be that none of them saw the bandits on the run?

179

If they fail to guard the four gates,

180

the defenses of Hanyang will be toppled.

Please give it to me.

332
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,600
I shall care for it devotedly.

333
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,320
Where are you taking me?

334
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,310
What do you have to say to me that you brought me all the way here?

335
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,620
Well, I...

336
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,300
I have something to tell you in private.

337
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,260
The thing is...

338
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,300
If you are going to ask me to deliver a love letter again, I refuse.

339
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,920
That isn't it.

340
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,860
That love letter wasn't even mine.

341
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,920
It wasn't...

342
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,080
yours?

343
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,780
Someone just asked me to pass it onto Jade Lad.

344
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,440
What? I already told him that it was from you.

345
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,530
Well, my goodness. It looks like I'll be scolded.

346
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,990
I apologize.

347
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,260
Tell me who the subject is properly when you give me things like that.

348
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,480
I cannot tell you who sent it.

349
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,230
That's fine. Never mind that.

350
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,710
I apologize.

351
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,790
What are you...

352
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,210
apologizing for again?

353
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,930
All of it.

354
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,160
Everything from beginning to now. I apologize.

355
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,750
Even for the things I cannot tell you why.

356
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,460
I'm sorry for all of it.

357
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,480
Maiden, why are you acting like this? As if you won't see me again.

358
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,970
Thank you.

359
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,720
I realize it now.

360
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,570
Realize what?

361
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,540
That you cannot gain someone's heart by begging.

362
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,610
Pardon?

363
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,490
No matter which direction the heart goes,

364
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,730
those who are meant to be man and wife are predestined.

365
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,260
Like yourself and Inspector Nam.

366
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,790
From now on,

367
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,170
I will gain a connection with that person before their heart.

368
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,400
So, I hope...

369
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,280
you live happily ever after with Inspector Nam.

370
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,590
You were right, Young Tenant.

371
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,470
Everything was a lie.

372
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,290
No matter what I tell you now,

373
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,320
they are all lies.

374
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,330
From the beginning to the end,

375
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,080
there is nothing I can tell you

376
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,070
truthfully, Young Tenant.

377
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,620
I only said that because I was angry—

378
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,110
But only one thing.

379
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,840
There is one truth that I can tell you.

380
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,300
Congratulations on your marriage.

381
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,710
I mean it.

382
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,340
I have said everything I need to, so I will get going.

383
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,040
Is something the matter?

384
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,910
Do not try to find out.

385
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,730
And do not look at me with those worried eyes.

386
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,820
It is uncomfortable.

387
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,330
Just seeing your face...

388
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,510
makes me feel uncomfortable.

389
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,620
So...

390
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,470
just stay here.

391
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,090
I will be going.

392
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,410
Maiden.

393
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,800
I beg you.

394
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,850
Just count to ten before you move.

395
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,400
Only to ten.

396
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,290
Then you can move.

397

♫ When I walked one step closer to you ♫

398

♫ You would walk two steps away ♫

399
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:06,130
♫ I think of how we used to be ♫

400
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,250
♫ My heart ached too much ♫

401

♫ So I decided not to long for you anymore ♫

402
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:23,510
♫ Just watching you made me ache ♫

403
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,990
♫ I still saw you at the end of a long day/i> ♫

404
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:35,330
♫ And spent those days hating myself ♫

405
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,910
One.

406
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,310
Two.

Five.

411
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,920
Six.

412
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,740
I don't have any good memories in Hanyang.

413
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,400
No good memories...

414
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,000
A scholar's arrow is meant to protect people, not to hurt them.

417
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,960
There should be a distinction between men and women. How could we share the same table?

418
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,570
A ghost!

419
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,370
You scared me... don't do that...

420
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,340
Please don't do that...

421
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,530
- Wait. Wait!
- Take it off.

422
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,530
Wait! What are you doing?

423
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,780
This guy is extremely malicious.

424
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,350
Why are you walking so fast?

425
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,810
Did you take a good look at it?

426

Your feet should be as wide as your shoulders.

429
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,660
Split the strength between two arms pulling and pushing.

430
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,410
Put your right hand under your chin.

431
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,740
You said either hang your head or cut someone else's head when a woman is mocked.

♫ You probably won't know that I am like this ♫

436
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,530
You are impatient and too brazen for your own good,

437
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,840
so you will have many hardships in your life.

438
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,710
So,

439
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,860
think before you act.

440
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,090
And walk down a righteous path.

441
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,100
Geez.

442
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,230
Congratulations on your marriage.

443
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,210
I mean it.

444
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,950
Is something the matter?

445
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,620
Do not try to find out.

446
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,590
And do not look at me with those worried eyes.

447
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,680
It makes me uncomfortable.

448
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,240
Just seeing your face...

449
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,350
makes me feel uncomfortable.

450
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,980
[The Ministry of Defense approves transport of 75 rifles today]

451
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,450
Ten carts left the point of departure

452
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,890
and ten carts arrived at the Ministry of Defense.

453
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,330
But there were 12 passes received at Sungnyemun Gate.

454
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,920
Meaning two carts disappeared along the way.

455
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,020
Two carts...

456
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,170
disappeared?

457
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,470
Only these two passes had different handwritings.

458
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,830
It must mean that someone was smuggling weapons into the capital.

459
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,210
I am not sure.

460
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,450
It may not be weapons.

461
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,300
Pardon?

462
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,180
Show this to the Training Commander.

463
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,240
We need only deliver the truth.

464
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,200
Yes, Chief Royal Secretary.

465
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,290
A suspicious heart.

466
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,200
That heart makes the ghosts manifest in the dark.

467
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,440
Your Highness.

468
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
You woke up early and even got dressed?

469
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,270
A cooked egg will crow instead of a rooster.

470
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,740
That's enough.

471
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,660
Eol Dong, starting today, you will look into Maiden Ro Seo's family.

472
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,300
Who her father was,

473
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,380
if she has any living relatives.

474
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,390
Both maternal and paternal sides of her family.

475
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,210
Why her family?

476
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,910
I'm going to bring her into the palace.

477
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,260
Pardon?

478
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,030
To the palace?

479
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,550
- As a court lady?
- No.

480
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,270
If I'm going to bring her here,

481
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,080
I might as well bring her into the most valuable position.

482
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,330
Did you hear?

483
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,720
Crown Prince has a woman outside the palace.

484
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,810
What if he gets her pregnant and brings her here?

485
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,430
She could be pregnant already!

486
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,880
Goodness!

487
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,650
Gosh.

488
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,660
So? Which family is she from?

489
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,640
From what I heard, she is married.

490
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,180
- No way.
- Your Highness, you must maintain your dignity.

491
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,880
Be quiet.

492
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,580
I can barely hear them.

493
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,900
My, it must be nice.

494
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,400
Oh, I can hear them.

495
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,370
So, which family was the woman you saw that day from?

496
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,850
She was the daughter of the Minister of Defense.

497
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,460

Are they not discussing marriage with that tutor at the Eastern Palace, Nam Young?

500

Ae Jin.

It's your favorite grilled short rib patties.

My. Smells amazing.

503
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,460
Here. Just one bite.

504
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,370
No, thank you.

505

Why won't you eat?

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,210
Is it that Mount Kumgang sickness again?

507

Aigoo. You keep asking to go to Mount Kumgang.

508

Every year without fail.

509
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,680
Come now. I told you,

510
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,750
a woman cannot go to Mount Kumgang.

511
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,350
Besides, your marriage is drawing near.

512

I do not want to get married!

I do not want to get married!

514
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,100
Why would you not want to be married?

515
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,670
Is it that you do not like Inspector Nam?

516
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:35,480
I cannot even go to Mount Kumgang because I am a woman.

517
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,010
And I cannot even marry a man that I love.

518
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,020
I do not wish to live.

519

I'm going to starve myself to death.

520

Aigoo.

521
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,610
Then how could I live?

522
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,940
Ae Jin. Here...

523
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,470
You could not think of Mount Kumgang if you do not eat.

524
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,740
Ae Jin.

528
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,500
I looked into it, thinking they may be forged documents,

529
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,870
but the official at the Ministry of the Defense said they were legitimate.

530
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:20,610
If it isn't to strengthen the military without our knowledge,

what else could it be?

532

The Chief Royal Secretary could not have brought up the military reform for nothing.

He met with the Minister of Defense privately not long ago.

Search thoroughly and make sure there are no weapons we missed.

Only ten carts were brought in this time.

This is...

The Minister of Defense...

558
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,360
So he chose to crop his own wings.

559

So? It isn't as if I received the money.

Is it a problem to spend money?

565
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,190
Spending money isn't the problem. However...

566
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,150
if the money that was supposed to be spent wasn't,

567

that could be a problem.

568

Every roof tile at the vacation home is meticulously recorded,

569
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,280
but why did you not pay anything to the workers?

570
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,240
T-that is...

571
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,120
because I agreed to pay it to the Labor and Commodity Administration all at once.

572
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,060
Then I will have to ask an official there about the details.

You.

Do you think a sword cannot cut an inspector?

At least then,

I would be able to see who is holding the sword.

The owner of this inn originally

579

started out as a labor administrator, providing labor to the government office.

It has become the largest Labor and Commodity Administration in Hanyang.

It is an incident that I began investigating, so I shall complete it myself.

Listening to his words alone and arresting the Police Chief. What were you thinking?

595

- That was—
- Everything has order and procedures.

596

How is an inspector of the Inspector General Office supposed to inspect others' wrongdoings

when he cannot even follow basic policies?

This is the record of the Police Chief's vacation home construction.

You pulled it out for me

as if you had prepared it.

606
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,850
Making records is what I always do.

607
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,400
I told you, I finished investigating it myself.

00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:22,830
Is this all right?

Don't worry.

617

Only the flower? The moon is also out.

- It calls for alcohol.

Geez.

00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,650
Only the flower?

626
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,070
The moon is also out.

627
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,290
- When the moon is out?
- You die.

628
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,150
What?

629
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,740
That can't be right.

630
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,160
What was that? I said as I was told.

631

We verify with our faces.

632
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:42,340
Then what was the point of moonflower and all that?

633
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,090
It sounds cool.

634
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,390
Who's this?

635
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,970
This is Gye Sang Mok.

636
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:50,780
Oh. That Gye Sang...

637
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,940
I've been meaning to come after you.

638
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,840
How kind of you to make your way here on your own.

639
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,780
What's wrong with him? Is he crazy?

640
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,820
He did bang his head pretty hard.

641
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,500
I knew it.

642
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,300
My heart pounded every time I saw you, My Lady.

643
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:26,520
That was Gye Sang Mok's primal and animalistic instinct of smelling money.

644
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,360
What nonsense is this?

All the owners of secret alcohol dens are suffering because there is no alcohol in the capital.

647

But with your alcohol,

648
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,980
you could earn a ton of money.

649
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,060
My Lady.

650
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,430
Leave this man to us and go.

651
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,260
You must sneak the alcohol.

652
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:00,610
Then, I shall leave him to you.

653

Make a copy of everything and organize them.

654
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,280
All of them?

655
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,020
You wanted to do something useless.

656
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,010
So I'm giving you something useless to do.

657
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,420
Don't complain, and just do it.

658
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,270
The Police Chief will be under house arrest,

659
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,250
so there is no need to rush on investigating him.

660
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,980
What do you mean by that?

661
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,970
House arrest?

662
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,120
The next day is the 25th.

663
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,290
The day munitions will be stocked at the Ministry of Defense.

664
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,870
How dare they steal the military seal

665
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:18,350
and shamelessly smuggled guns into the capital.

666
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,960
I shall grandly award the man who makes the arrest.

667
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,010
So do not let them get away.

668
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,560
Understood!

669
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,880
My Lady, at least have a sip of this broth.

670
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,520
How long are you going to starve yourself?

671
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,330
You are really going to fall ill.

672
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,060
I would rather starve to death than get married.

673
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,870
The Ministry of Defense is a mess right now.

674
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:46,400
His Excellency must be deeply troubled.

675
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,900
Just how disheartened would

676
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,150
His Excellency be if you're being like this?

677
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,950
Why is the Minister of Defense a mess?

678
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,310
My Lady.

679
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,580
What do you need a horse for all of a sudden?

680
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,330
You are going to be in big trouble!

681
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,840
If they get caught, I'll be in trouble too.

682
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,980
Aigoo, My Lady!

683
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,610
My Lady!

684
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:32,800
Father.

685
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,220
What... Ae Jin.

686
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,910
What are you doing out here?

687
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,140
Pardon?

688
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,320
Oh... um...

689
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,370
Well... um...

690
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:57,040
[The Ministry of Defense approves transport of...]

691
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:09,220
Ae Jin.

692
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,160
I am quite busy.

693
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,810
Go back home.

694
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,510
Take Ae Jin home.

695
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,810
Yes, sir.

696
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,680
Father, I...

697
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,460
Father.

698
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:28,870
Father. Please forgive me.

699
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,240
What is going on with you?

700
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,190
Pass through.

701
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,780
Father!

702
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,480
Dear Father, you worried for me

703
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,110
and cut...

704
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:57,230
Cut the grilled short rib patties with your own hands.

705
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,570
But I did not eat it

706
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,120
and threw a tantrum, causing you anguish.

707
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:08,410
Please forgive this ungrateful daughter of yours.

708
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,790
This child...

709
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,160
Ae Jin, there is no time for this.

710
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,510
Return home.

711
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,640
Father.

712
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,900
Are you forgiving me?

713
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,770
Of course. Of course, I forgive you.

714
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,340
Is that not Lady Ae Jin?

715
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,420
Hurry and go.

716
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,910
I think something went wrong.

717
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,110
His Excellency, a cart is approaching.

718
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,390
What?

719
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,930
Oh, I feel faint!

720
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,580
It's because I didn't have those grilled short rib patties.

721
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,490
Ae Jin!

722
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:50,290
Listen! Do not miss a single cart and chase after them!

723
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,110
- Yes, Sir!
- Ae Jin...

724
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,630
Ae Jin!

725
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,770
Stop!

726
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,070
Ae Jin?

727
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,430
Goodness.

728
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,560
Hurry, hurry! Run, run!

729
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,270
Run!

730
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,650
What do you mean?

731
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,740
Return the Police Chief home?

732
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,110
The Inspector General commanded

733
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:52,970
that he be under house arrest according to procedure until His Majesty's approval.

734
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:56,410
How could we let him go after the last incident?

735
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,020
The Police Chief's life could be in danger.

736
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,800
Where do you think you're going?

737
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,720
You could be dismissed if you keep doing this.

738
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,820
Who's there?

739
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,320
Who is there?

740
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,580
Anyone—

741
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,070
- What is going on?
- I think we were found out.

742
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:20,140
The guards are searching the capital.

743
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,480
What about the lady?

744
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:50,890
Don't struggle and come with us.

745
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,900
Did you not say that you had questions regarding Mangwolsa Temple?

746
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,040
I also have many questions.

747
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,060
What you know...

748
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,670
and how much you know.

749
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,070
You will have to reveal everything.

750
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,250
Take him.

751
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,630
What are you doing? Hurry.

752
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:47,710
♫ I say, who you are, who you are ♫

753
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:51,690
♫ The question that fills my heart ♫

754
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:58,740
♫ You came to me after so many days have passed ♫

755
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:07,040
♫ My meaningless day is being filled with you ♫

756
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,210
[Moonshine]

757
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:12,760
I think it would be better if we part ways here.

758
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,040
You have somewhere to return to, Young Tenant.

759
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,250
You have a road of flowers and silk ahead of you.

760
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,210
You will come to me on your own this time.

761
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,690
He took Lady Kang.

762
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,900
What are we to do?

763
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,510
They are meaningless.

764
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,770
Roads of flowers or silk. They will not make me waver.

765
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,050
Don't hurt Young Tenant.

766
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,440
I won't let this go!

767
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,130
Open this door!

768
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:36,110
One.

769
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,400
Two.

770
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,700
Three.

771
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,360
I'll count to ten. And to ten again.

772
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,850
I'll always be yours.
