1
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,100
Can't believe the Crown Prince appears out of nowhere.

2
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,210
Will this not be a problem?

3
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,720
The Crown Prince appears between an alcohol smuggler and an inspector.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,340
With this turn of events, we will have to find their base and take care of them covertly.

5
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,650
By base, you mean...

6
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,650
There was more than one cart that passed through the capital gate.

7
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,730
If there is a seller, there has to be a buyer.

8
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,830
Search the capital thoroughly and find those who bought alcohol.

9
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,050
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,550
It is the order of the Chief Royal Secretary.

11
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,020
Go ahead.

12
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,800
Bring her into the palace? Not that girl.

13
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,860
Why can't I bring her?

14
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,870
She is the daughter of Kang Ho Yeon, Hyungnim's guard.

15
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,260
You said you were close to him.

16
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,900
Once they find out Your Highness brought that girl into the palace,

17
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,750
she will be in danger as well as you.

18
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,850
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,370
Whom are you saying should not find out?

20
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,340
Who else could it be?

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,810
Do you mean Chief State Minister

22
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,870
was involved with the death of the maiden's father?

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,450
Do not try to dig deeper.

24
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,120
Your Highness does not have the power

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,400
to protect yourself or that girl.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
For now, stay put.

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,170
After I take care of everything,

28
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,200
I shall find a way for you to keep

29
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,580
that girl by your side.

30
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,260
No one saw you.

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,600
Father is quite angry, however.

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,390
But do not worry about it.

33
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,620
If anything happens, I shall let you know right away.

34
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,760
Thank you, Maiden Han.

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,010
Gosh.

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,380
Well, there are some reasons for me not to like you...

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,810
but you are helping me by not getting caught.

38
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,240
Are you feeling better?

39
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,070
Goodness, I'm fine.

40
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,120
I only bled a little. Otherwise, I'm—

41
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,190
You aren't fine!

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,590
Aigoo, you are safe and well, Geum.

43
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,120
That's the only thing that matters to me.

44
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,020
Thank you, Maiden Han.

45
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,050
All the women I got to know in Hanyang are lawbreakers.

46
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,080
But you wouldn't take them all to the Office of Inspector General, would you?

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Knowing the truth and hiding the criminal is also a crime.

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,350
Pardon?

49
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,960
It means we are accomplices.

50
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,640
I see...

51
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,140
What can we do?

52
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,960
She's so pretty. I cannot find fault with her.

53
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,010
- What should we do?
- So...

54
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,820
what happened with you and Young Master Nam?

55
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,900
It isn't like that!

56
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,530
"Like that?"

57
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,800
What is "that"?

58
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,540
I only asked how you got caught.

59
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh, I...

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,550
Well...

61
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,340
My Lady, you do not seem well.

62
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,100
- Are you unwell?
- Yeah.

63
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,600
No.

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,940
No.

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,390
Your pulse is so fast.

66
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,350
Five pulses are normal in a single breath,

67
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,850
but right now, it's six...

68
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,890
No, seven.

69
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,420
You're breathing fast, and your face is flushed.

70
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,900
It must be because of what happened yesterday.

71
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,650
That horrid man did that horrid thing.

72
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,260
Maiden, take a deep breath.

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,090
Goodness, no! That's not it.

74
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,270
Well... It's just that it is hot.

75
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,890
Goodness, so hot in here.

76
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,400
Maiden Han, I must speak with you.

77
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,210
My Lady.

78
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,960
Why are you in a daze? Did something happen?

79
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,790
- Young Master!
- No, no.

80
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,290
No...

81
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,140
Yes, Choon Gae, escort Lady Han to her home.

82
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,810
This way, My Lady.

83
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,300
Maiden. I will be going now.

84
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,620
Maiden.

85
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,400
I was not thinking properly yesterday.

86
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,260
Suddenly finding out Jade Lad is the Crown Prince...

87
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,150
I was not in the right mind, and too many things were happening.

88
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,780
So, there is no need to explain anything to me or ask me to be understanding.

89
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,330
I know well that you are to marry Maiden Han.

90
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,850
Let us pretend it never happened.

91
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,020
I do not concern myself anyway.

92
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,270
But I do.

93
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,090
That is enough.

94
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,840
Right now, our priority is to catch that man.

95
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,570
You and I can both be safe once he is caught.

96
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,210
And after that...

97
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,920
And after that, let us discuss

98
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,730
the other matters then.

99
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,130
Go back inside.

100
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,410
I am here to ask you something.

101
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,790
I am glad you are safe.

102
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,030
I was worried.

103
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,270
What is your true intention?

104
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,780
True intention?

105
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,600
Are you not close with Merchant Sim?

106
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,930
So you met him.

107
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,500
I already told you.

108
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,470
You will get to meet him eventually while in this business.

109
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,340
What is your relationship with him?

110
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,660
We used to be in love when we were younger.

111
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,470
But now, we are only a courtesan and an owner of an inn.

112
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,830
We are even less than that.

113
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,610
I am asking what you intended to do by dragging me into this.

114
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,270
What do you intend to do?

115
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,060
I will catch him.

116
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,970
Before that man can hurt the people I care about,

117
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,450
I will get him first.

118
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,910
How?

119
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,770
With guns?

120
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,040
There are multiple patrolmen at Merchant Sim's inn.

121
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,990
A single misfired gun

122
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,000
means they can kill two of you.

123
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,250
I guess you do not care about

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,990
losing another son.

125
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,810
- Shut that—
- You will have to find another way.

126
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,460
A way to cut off his limbs

127
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,860
and make sure he cannot do a thing.

128
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,060
Is that girl safe?

129
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,700
Yes, Chief Royal Secretary.

130
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,520
As far as involving His Highness in such a dangerous incident,

131
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,880
I should hold you responsible.

132
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,580
But I will not.

133
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,670
- Forgive me.
- Instead,

134
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,070
last night's events did not happen.

135
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,240
The fact that His Highness ran out to save a woman outside the palace

136
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,750
cannot be found out by the rumor-hungry vultures.

137
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,280
Do you understand?

138
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,000
I understand.

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,350
So...

140
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,100
what is your business with that man from last night

141
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,840
that you got yourself into such a dangerous matter?

142
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,460
On the outside, he is merely an owner of an ordinary inn,

143
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,470
but in truth, he is a heinous man

144
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,150
who runs a distillery and kills for his own benefit.

145
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,250
Please allow me to report this to His Majesty and reveal the truth.

146
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,050
Did you find evidence?

147
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,290
Not yet.

148
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,720
Find evidence.

149
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,320
Once you do, I shall submit a report to His Majesty.

150
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,070
[Sim Heon's inn]

151
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,740
Merchant Sim or Sim What...

152
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,020
When is he going to show up?

153
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,560
Daughter of the Southern Mountain Tiger?

154
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,210
- That wench?
- Yes, sir.

155
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,220
Kang Ro Seo is Kang Ho Yeon's daughter.

156
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,390
She lives alone with her brother.

157
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,070
Their house seemed to have been empty for a few days.

158
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,780
And the ones who bought her alcohol?

159
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,920
We are still searching.

160
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,350
You know the protection fees are due on the 15th of this month, correct?

161
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,470
Make preparations.

162
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,980
I cannot even sell anything. What protection fee?

163
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,280
At least, give me some alcohol before demanding me to pay taxes.

164
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,850
Aigoo!

165
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,240
Do you want me to report you?

166
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,980
Should I report you to the Prohibition Bureau?

167
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,590
The alcohol is coming soon. Just prepare the protection fee.

168
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,990
The inn has impenetrable defenses.

There are multiple thugs guarding the place.

170
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,930
They check the identity of all the merchants who enter.

171

172
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,800
It will only put you in more danger.

173
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,400
If we find evidence first, we can submit a report to His Majesty.

174
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,020
So finding evidence is our priority.

Evidence?

176
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,540
Evidence would be piled up inside the inn.

177
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,860
The problem is that even if we find evidence,

178
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,360
they will highly likely escape again by buying out an official.

179

The amount of money to pay off

We can make up for it once we get paid the protection fee from the distillery.

185

It is money in the end.

186
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,790
I heard they would earn tens of thousands of nyang on the 15th.

187
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,170
They buy out officials by paying them thousands of nyang

188

and they pay the Prohibition Bureau as well.

189
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,410

You know,

00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,450
I thought...

that there was nothing good about alcohol.

00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,430
That the alcohol ban was right and alcohol was bad.

I thought if alcohol disappeared from this world,

the world would be a brighter and better place.

Once we tried to get rid of alcohol,

445

and dig tunnels under the capital walls.

That is what the world has come to.

449
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,330
By nature, alcohol is medicine if used for good purposes

450
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,260
and poison if used for bad purposes.

451
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,610
I do not know much about the laws, but

452
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,740
I suppose this is true for everything.

453
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,750
For good purposes, it is medicine. For bad purposes, it is poison.

454
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,390
So it is all up to people.

455
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,590
Whether it becomes medicine or poison.

456
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,470
Goodness.

Without a heart of love, learning and success mean nothing.

460
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,310
Loving someone means that person's happiness becomes my happiness

461
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,260
and their worries become my worries.

462

She meant that...

463
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,700

00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,460
To live suppressing and hiding your true feelings?

503
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,460
If you live that way, the rice cake soup you ate this year will be digested by next year.

504
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,370
You are right.

505

For the first time in my life,

506
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,210
I intend on following what my heart desires.

507
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,090

510

It will be a long-term battle from now on.

513
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,910
I shall find out about Young Master Chui Joong's family

514
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,710
and appeal to my future in-laws. Yes.

515
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,000
Young, what are you doing?

516
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,480
Please forgive your disgraceful son.

517
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,870
For what?

518
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,730
I will not marry the Minister of Defense's daughter.

519
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,980
What do you mean?

520
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,160
Please...

521

522

523

There is no need for this.

524
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,890
For the past ten years,

525
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:05,860
you have looked after me like your own son, but there is no way for me to repay you.

526
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,160
All the while...

527
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,580
I have received so much support from the family. Thus, I have no right to ask this.

528
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,100
But please...

529

530
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,470

531
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,390
there is no need for this.

532
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,640
The marriage document was returned to us.

533
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,600

536
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,840
What brings you here at this late hour?

537
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,090
You charged the Ministry of Defense with the Capital Defense Military

538
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,300
and yet you have not apologized.

539
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,830
That was...

540
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,110
quite unfortunate.

541
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,500
Unfortunate?

542
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,960
Do you not think that you were partially responsible

543
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,390
for not taking proper care of the military seal?

544
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,280
Let me ask you one thing.

545
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,620
Thirty years ago, during the dethronement of the then king,

546
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,690
if my late father had not opened the palace gates for you,

547
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,850
would you have succeeded in the dethronement?

548
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,440
What do you mean by that?

549
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,950
A single choice can make a person an honorable subject

550
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,200
or the traitor of the nation.

551
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,400
- Minister of Defense!
- No matter how little regard you have for me,

552
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,210
you should not have raided the military storage without my approval.

553
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,760
I shall be breaking off the engagement with Inspector Nam.

554
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,750
There is no law stating that only the House of Yeon can produce queens and concubines.

555
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,040
Queens and concubines?

556
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,820
Is the Minister of Defense implying that he intends to make his daughter the Princess Consort?

557
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,890
The King intends to make the Minister of Defense the Crown Prince's father-in-law.

558
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,640
We have been fooled by Chief Royal Secretary's schemes.

559
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:18,210
Should the Minister of Defense becomes the Crown Prince's father-in-law,

560
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,470
the 3,000 soldiers will belong to the King's.

561
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,330
We must put a stop to this.

562
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,740
Remember the time of Crown Prince Sunghyun.

563
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,290
We encountered so much trouble because one of our own could not be the Princess Consort.

564
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,120
We must put a stop to this.

565
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,170
The tragedy of ten years ago

566
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,710

You already know this well, Your Majesty.

590

The Crown Prince...

591
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:37,440
is not as suitable for the throne as Crown Prince Sunghyun was.

Once the Crown Prince rises to the throne,

595
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,240
the nation will be in more chaos.

596
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,700
Would His Highness be able to succeed the throne safely,

597
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,240
and secure his place on it?

598
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,620
Are you using the Crown Prince

00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,350
to threaten me right now?

600
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:07,500
How could a Prohibition Bureau consisting of hoodlums

601
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,310
have any moral or center?

602

If...

the incident from 30 years ago should occur again,

604

00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,900
I thought I knew all the right and wrongs.

668
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,440
But only after meeting you

669
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,310
did I realize what I have known so far

670
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,870
was only regulations and laws.

671
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,980
♫ Even if I am alone ♫

672
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,210
Worrying for someone and caring for someone.

673
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:13,160
As a result, knowing what it feels like for the heart to be full...

674
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,170
I felt those feelings only after I met you.

675
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,880
No matter how much I try to empty my heart,

676
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,600
you have filled it up

677
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,350
and even my wishes and hopes

678
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,260
are all for you, Maiden.

679
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,540
Do not struggle.

680
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,070
I will make sure you are not lonely in your death

681
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,820
and send along that girl soon.

682
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,860
If a hunting dog is too wild,

683
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,110
it ruins the hunt.

684
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:23,090
If you let me handle it,

685
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,700
I will make sure I do not go against your will, sir.

686
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,230
Please give me one more chance, sir.

687
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,000
I will do anything you ask.

688
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,460
Now...

689
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,200
I shall be going, sir.

690
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:38,180
I hope that your afternoons are peaceful.

691
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:48,350
I hope that your nights are safe.

692
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,850
I hope that the ground is solid

693
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,730
and the sky is clear.

694
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,040
I hope the wind is gentle

695
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,820
and the waves

696
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,730
are calm.

697
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,550
That is all I wish for.

698
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,830
Perhaps...

699
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,750
I am too early,

700
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
or perhaps...

701
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,340
I am too late.

702
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,040
Would you please...

703
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,430
come meet me?

704
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,760
[Moonshine]

705
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,780
Did you hear the news?

706
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,650
That inspector died.

707
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,790
Is that true?

708
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,890
- Kang Ro Seo is here!
- Is that true?

709
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,010
Kang Ro Seo is here!

710
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,360
I must go and see for myself.

711
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,370
Don't move.

712
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:40,700
Where's Kang Ro Seo?

713
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,390
I lost my memories.

714
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,620
How dare you touch a woman without permission!

715
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,600
Are you not looking forward to it?

716
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,300
What Lady Kang might do after hearing that you died?

717
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,780
So please go find Lady Kang first.

718
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,590
I am too late.

719
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,450
I am so sorry.
