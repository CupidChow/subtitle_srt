35
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,930
An interrogation began as soon as the poison was found at her abode.

36
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,930
And the death sentence by poison was carried out at a rapid speed.

37
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,630
I was wondering why no one spoke against it.

38

Is it common for a palace maid of the Financial Bureau to start working at the King's quarters?

48

No. It is absolutely rare.

Unless someone put her there.

50
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,630

(The character meaning monkey)

it signifies a monkey.

Monkey.

117
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,620
He called him Monkey.

118
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,370
Your father was not trying to alert us about Sim Heon,

119

Monkey...

121
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,590
If Father called him that, it means he knew the man.

122
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,790
There has to be someone who knows about him.

123
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,060
What is the matter?

124
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,220
I am anxious.

125
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,570
The scattering of the post could have put that man in a difficult position,

126
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,230
but if he is set on killing everyone who knows about that day,

127
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,360
the person in most danger at the moment

128
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,000
is you, Maiden.

129
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,330
I am scared...

130
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,150
that I might lose you.

131
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,660
That I might not be able to protect you.

132
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,310
I will make sure that does not happen.

133
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,070
So...

134
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,810
do not let go.

135
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,920
I will not let go, either.

136
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,770
I will not let go.

137
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,820
Never.

138
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,300
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

Now that Sim Heon is dead,

there is no one to ask about that day.

141

If you mean to make sure the events of that day are true,

142
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,900
there is a witness.

143
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,340
A witness?

144
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,760
It is me.

145
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,160
- What?
- That day,

146
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,260
I was at Mangwolsa Temple.

147
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,410
Did you see Ho Yeon dying with your own eyes?

148
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,490
Yes.

149
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,210
I saw Sim Heon killing Guard Kang

150
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,270
with my own two eyes.

151
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,210
But...

152
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,390
the man who took Guard Kang's life, in the end, was not Sim Heon, but someone else.

153
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,660
Seeing as he wore funeral attire for the Crown Prince's mourning period,

154
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,970
he had to have been an official.

155
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,960
Did you see his face?

156
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,880
Forgive me for saying this,

157
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,870
but I did not see his face.

158
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,980
However...

159
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,250
I heard Guard Kang

160
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,090
call him Monkey.

161
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,720
Monkey?

162
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,760
After that day,

163
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,010
Sim Heon gathered people in Hanyang to form a group of government contractors.

164
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,370
The bureau that first issued him a government document

165
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,080
was the Prohibition Bureau.

166
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,040
There is a high chance that

167
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,480
it was someone who was connected to the Prohibition Bureau ten years ago.

168
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,720
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

169
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,770
Continue.

170
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,500
That man will try to kill Guard Kang's daughter.

171
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,300
Although she is a criminal who went against the alcohol ban,

172
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,400
please have mercy on her.

173
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,200
Ho Yeon died because I was incompetent.

174
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,600
How could I not feel sympathy toward his daughter?

175
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,240
But we must find out who killed Ho Yeon

176
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,830
so we can find a way to help his daughter.

177
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,680
Commander Nam, find out who the Monkey is.

178
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,270
But you must be discreet.

179
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

180
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,670
Monkey...

181
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,080
Monkey...

182
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,200
Monkey...

183
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,800
Your Highness.

184
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,390
Chief Royal Secretary is here.

185
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,390
Do not let anyone in.

186
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,600
Your Excellency, it seems His Highness is not feeling—

187
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,680
C-chief...

188
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,410
Chief Royal Secretary!

189
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,290
I did not allow you to enter.

190
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,330
Eunuch Kim, send everyone away.

191
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,110
Do not leave.

192
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,100
You must go back.

193
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,870
I am not feeling well.

194
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,900
Did I not tell you to send everyone away?

195
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,100
U-understood.

196
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,800
I came because I thought you might be curious.

197
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,000
I am not curious.

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,340
- Instigating Sim Heon—
- I do not want to hear it.

199
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,150
Instigating Sim Heon to get rid of Kang Ro Seo and Commander Nam was also—

200
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,170
I said I do not want to hear it.

201
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,600
Killing Ho Yeon was also my doing.

202
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,200
Did you not say he was your close friend?

203
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,230
It could not be helped.

204
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,590
He had found out something he should not have.

205
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,220
Something he should not find out?

206
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,600
I poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun.

207
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,410
What did you...

208
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,140
just say?

209
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,850
It was not Lady Consortship Sukwon Um.

210
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,540
It was me, Your Highness.

211
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,670
No.

212
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,080
That is impossible. That is not possible.

213
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,890
It was to pass on a strong country to Your Highness.

214
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,490
To make sure the officials do not try to seize and control you.

215
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,460
The alcohol ban was for you.

216
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,390
The Prohibition Bureau was formed for you.

217
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
Bringing in the daughter of the Minister of Defense as princess consort was also for you.

218
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,900
All these things were all for you.

219
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,490
For me?

220
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,050
Killing Commander Nam and Maiden Ro Seo

221
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,630
was all for me?

222
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,590
If they reveal all the truth,

223
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,060
the court will discuss deposing you, Your Highness.

224
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,360
Stopping that from happening is also for you.

225
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,080
That is enough!

226
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,800
I have never wanted to become the Crown Prince!

227
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,700
I must immediately report this to Father.

228
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,980
Do you think Royal Consort Gyeongbin

229
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,960
will be safe then?

230
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,580
It was rumored that Royal Consort Gyeongbin had poisoned the Crown Prince.

231
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,930
If you are deposed, will they

232
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,310
let Royal Consort Gyeongbin live?

233
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,700
If you want to see your mother's title stripped and sentenced to death by poison,

234
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,900
go ahead and tell His Majesty.

235
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,400
You do not need to do anything, Your Highness.

236
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,200
I shall get rid of everything that gets in your way, Your Highness.

237
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,260
I will not do anything.

238
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,360
I shall pretend I never heard anything.

239
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,620
Please...

240
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,780
spare their lives.

241
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,280
How can you be so soft-hearted?

242
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,000
You should know that as a King,

243
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,340
you should be prepared to cut off

244
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,100
anyone who gets in the way, even if they may be your own blood.

245
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,680
They are my friends.

246
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,160
For the first time in my life,

247
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,470
I have opened my hearts to them as friends.

248
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,690
I will do anything else you ask of me, Uncle.

249
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,220
So, please...

250
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,570
Please spare their lives.

251
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,500
They will end up endangering Your Highness and Royal Consort Gyeongbin.

252
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,130
We can...

253
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,970
give them what they are looking for.

254
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,700
Make up a false criminal, and let them believe that they avenged her father.

255
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,710
How would you make a false criminal?

256
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,590
A palace maid overheard the Training Commander

257
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,280
talking with the servant of the Queen's Palace.

258
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,330
It was regarding the deposed consort from ten years ago.

259
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,560
It is clear the two planted the poison in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode,

260
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
so we can make it look like they hired someone to kill Guard Kang.

261
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,460
Is there evidence?

262
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,520
Evidence...

263
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,710
can be forged.

264
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,490
That is right.

265
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,810
Now, you are acting like a King.

266
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:52,991
I have a way to steal the military power back from them.

267
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:55,491
[Ten years ago, October of the Year of the Monkey]
It is an alcohol ban.

268
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,571
Alcohol ban?

269
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:59,251
Your Majesty is powerless,

270
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:04,401
so you cannot allow or ban it without justification. However...

271
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,731
there is a justification that the alcohol ban conserves crops.

272
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,701
Your Majesty, use that justification.

273
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,591
Justification...

274
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:15,601
But the alcohol ban will be temporary.

275
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:19,201
How many would indeed follow that law?

276
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:22,951
Only the destitute people will suffer.

277
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:25,701
Hence the alcohol ban.

278
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:29,791
There is justification, but the law will not be followed.

279
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:33,261
There will certainly be those who defy the ban and then

280
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:39,201
that would give new justification to create a group to enforce the law on those people.

281
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:43,121
No one will suspect that the alcohol ban

282
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:47,821
is meant for Your Majesty to create an army.

283
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:53,901
It will take less than ten years for that small group to become Your Majesty's army.

284
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:57,501
Your Majesty, Chief Royal Secretary is here to see you.

285
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:59,511
Let him enter.

286
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:16,601
Your Majesty, the criminal who poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun was finally discovered.

287
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:21,111
Court Lady Park disappeared?

288
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:22,531
What do you mean?

289
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:26,901
Well, her house has been emptied out, and she is nowhere to be found.

290
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,961
W-what?

291
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,691
Arrest him!

292
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:42,571
Arrest Training Commander Yeon Chae Bong.

293
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:44,141
Yes, Sir.

294
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:46,481
Let me go. Get your hands off of me.

295
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,431
What is the meaning of this ruckus, Minister of Defense?

296
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:51,661
There is an accusation that the Training Commander conspired with the servant of the Queen's Palace

297
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:56,611
and planted poison in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode ten years ago.

298
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:57,471
Father—

299
00:25:57,471 --> 00:26:02,291
You will not be able to leave your residence, either, Chief State Minister.

300
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:08,001
You will have to explain yourself, Training Commander.

301
00:26:08,021 --> 00:26:09,581
Take him away.

302
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,511
Let me go. Let me go!

303
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,391
Wait...

304
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:16,811
Let me go!

305
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:20,351
- Chief Royal Secretary?
- Yes.

306
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:22,501
Chief Royal Secretary asked the soldiers to repair the rampart,

307
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:25,041
so they could not be dispatched right away.

308
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:28,101
- Coincidentally on that day?
- Yes.

309
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:32,401
But thankfully, I ran into the Chief Royal Secretary in front of the Ministry of Defense.

310
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:34,781
He told me that the soldiers of the Prohibition Bureau could help,

311
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:36,501
so I showed him the insignia.

312
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:39,271
"Scare the snake by stirring the bushes."

313
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:43,131
We stirred the bushes, so the snake will soon lift its head.

314
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:45,251
What are you doing right now?

315
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:52,371
If you continue to find fault with this matter,

316
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:55,801
it is no different from turning your back against His Highness and His Majesty.

317
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,471
Keep that in mind, and do not forget it.

318
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:19,411
The person who wants to keep Sim Heon from talking the most.

319
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:22,981
Commander Nam!

320
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:25,171
Chief Inspector.

321
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:28,631
The Training Commander has been arrested.

322
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:31,361
What do you mean?

323
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:35,891
Ten years ago, the Training Commander planted poison in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode.

324
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:40,191
He is accused of murdering Guard Kang to cover it up.

325
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:46,021
The Training Commander was behind Sim Heon?

326
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:47,511
Is that true?

327
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:48,821
It is true.

328
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:53,011
Princess Consort overheard the Training Commander speaking with

329
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,351
the servant of the Queen's Palace.

330
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:56,221
Princess Consort?

331
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:57,411
What about evidence?

332
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,401
Is there evidence?

333
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:04,101

Yes. It was the Training Commander.

He killed Crown Prince Sunghyun and blamed it on Lady Consortship Sukwon Um,

348

Ten years ago, this criminal

359
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,941
You poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun

360
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:43,161
and blamed it on Lady Consortship Sukwon Um,

361
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:48,151
then promoted Park to the palace maid of the private royal quarters for the deed.

362
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:51,921
Chief Royal Secretary asked the soldiers to repair the rampart,

363
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,931
so they could not be dispatched right away.

364

That court lady is the private servant of the Queen's Palace?

371
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,241
Apparently so.

In any case, Chief Royal Secretary...

382
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:19,221
is already planning to kill us by accusing us of treason.

The Training Commander's army has been decreased by half in size.

How could we go up against them?

385
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,321
Then,

386
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:28,741
should we do nothing

and let Lee Shi Heum have our necks?

388

If we do nothing,

we will become traitors for certain.

What are you investigating?

506
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:03,031
Are you looking for more evidence?

507
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:07,701
I was only searching for the evidence that the Maiden's father left behind.

508
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:10,091
One of them was in the palace.

509
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:12,791
Nothing is for certain yet.

510

If everything ends well,

511
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:18,071
I shall do something about the charges against the Maiden.

512
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,891
So do not put the Maiden in danger anymore.

513

You are my friends,

There are three types of friends in this world who are useful when befriended.

516

but you mean to replace the King once again?

00:46:36,131 --> 00:46:37,931
"The Crown Prince will not give up on a private army,

so if we cannot stop him, we must kill him

581
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:45,101

Do you not remember?

Twenty-nine years ago,

586
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,971
you taught it to me yourself.

587
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:16,111
It looked exactly the same as Grand Prince Neungsan's.

588
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:20,851
Write down what I say.

589
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:28,331
This is the letter that Grand Prince Neungsan sent to Right State Minister.

590
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:35,651
Even then, no one suspected a thing.

irrationality becomes reason.

594
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,171
How long do you think you can fool the heavens

595
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,411
with such fleeting foolery?

596
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:07,721
If heaven is not on my side,

597
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:12,481
all I need to do is move the heaven and change the sun.

598
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,641
I have raised a tiger...

599
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,221
and let it into my garden.

600
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:51,551
Is this...

601
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:56,321
the truth?

Finally, we can undo the injustice done against Crown Prince Sunghyun.

603

What will happen to Chief State Minister and the Training Commander?

They will be punishable as traitors.

605
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:44,131
Then, are Commander Nam and Maiden Ro Seo safe?

606

It would depend on how Your Highness manages them.

607

Try to reason with them as much as you can.

Something feels off.

What does?

622
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:31,851
The Maiden usually does not look so put together like this.

623
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:44,691
I obtained a portion of the poison that was found in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode.

624
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:48,051
I placed a silver needle in it and checked again in an hour.

625
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:51,191
The silver had turned black.

626
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,971
There was no color change from the silver needle in the Crown Prince's body,

627
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:59,161
thus it is suspected that it was a different kind of poison.

629

Of course, I got it from a witness.

He must have had some drawing skills.

631

He had already drawn it and brought it in.

He had already drawn it and brought it in?

633
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:20,851
Usually, we have a painter sit down

634
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:24,801
and say whether it looks like the person or not and repeat the drawing process.

635
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,541
So it takes a long time.

636

But thankfully, the process moved swiftly.

637

His Highness vomited green bile,

638
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,301
so I asked the physicians in the market street,

639
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:38,251
Not that kind of poison...

640
00:52:38,251 --> 00:52:40,011
Do you know of any poison that makes one vomit?

641
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:45,411
No one knew of a poison that made one vomit bile.

642
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:50,881
While I was away from the house, someone had left an anonymous letter.

643
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:56,101
It told me to investigate the goods that Interpreter Jang San Moon brought in from Tsing.

644
00:52:57,781 --> 00:53:00,981
I visited Interpreter Jang, but

[Interpreter Jang's house]
 a robber had broken in

killing the entire family and burning down the house,

and revealed that she had sent the anonymous letter.

666
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:51,361
She told me why she had sent it to me.

667
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:54,411
As for what I heard from Mistress Jo,

668
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:58,831
I shall decipher its validity before recording it here.

669
00:55:00,461 --> 00:55:02,441
He left this with me

670
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:04,951
and said that if he does not return,

671
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:08,911
I must meet with Mistress Jo of Giringak.

672
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:13,011
But by the time I visited her,

673
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:15,691
her funeral had already taken place.

674
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:19,101
Now I leave this with you.

675
00:55:19,101 --> 00:55:21,451
As Guard Kang's daughter,

676
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,881
you will be better off

677
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:27,181
than me stuck in this palace.

678
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:29,011
Mistress Jo...

679
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:55,891
I do not know who it is. I only received the money.

680
00:55:56,951 --> 00:55:58,481
Oh, but his hand...

681
00:55:59,151 --> 00:56:02,371
His right hand had six fingers.

682
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:18,201
Is Chief Royal Secretary in?

683
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:40,901
Why are you here without contacting me first?

684
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,431
And alone?

685
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:46,521
You are not in a position to roam around recklessly.

686
00:56:46,521 --> 00:56:50,781
I am here to ask you something.

687
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:55,631
You must know how my father died

688
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:59,591
if you saw the open letter.

689
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:03,121
The day before my father died,

690
00:57:04,611 --> 00:57:07,501
a courtesan visited him.

691
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:10,991
[Ten years ago, October of the Year of the Monkey]

692
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:16,161
Was it you who left the anonymous letter?

693
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,231
Yes.

694
00:57:18,231 --> 00:57:21,091
I left it, Sir.

695
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:25,031
Then tell me.

696
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:27,401
You must have a reason for visiting me.

697
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:30,611
That is...

698
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:41,901
That is how he left and returned as a corpse.

699
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:45,981
The courtesan who visited my father that day

700
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:48,641
was Mistress Jo.

701
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:54,721
I found out Mistress Jo had died the same day my father died.

702
00:57:56,221 --> 00:58:00,211
Do you know something about this?

703
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:06,401
Why would you want to know about that?

704
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:08,911
The criminals who killed your father

705
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:13,301
have already been revealed as the Chief State Minister and the Training Commander.

706
00:58:13,301 --> 00:58:15,741
Do you think that as well?

707
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:19,561
That Sim Heon's commander was the Chief State Minister?

708
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:25,841
If you know something, do tell me.

709
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,651
Any detail.

710
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:31,571
- If you remember anything—
- She is alive.

711
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:35,451
What?

712
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:38,651
Mistress Jo.

713
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:41,641
She is alive.

714
00:59:18,781 --> 00:59:20,871
Go down.

715
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:00,781
His Excellency is taking a bath at the moment.

716
01:00:00,781 --> 01:00:03,151
Please wait here.

717
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:04,751
All right.

718
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:40,511
Judging by the writing,

719
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,161
the ink is as black as jade and has a tinge of violet,

720
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:45,311
and even the scent is fresh.

721
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:48,581
So it is a top-grade ink made of pine trees.

722
01:00:50,011 --> 01:00:51,621
It is the same scent.

723
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:53,411
A top-grade ink made of pine trees.

724
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:38,641
Monkey.

725
01:01:55,431 --> 01:02:00,031
Do you know who the Monkey is?

726
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:57,331
The Monkey! The Monkey will kill me!

727
01:02:57,331 --> 01:02:59,451
He will kill me!

728
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:00,771
I will die!

729
01:03:00,771 --> 01:03:02,281
I will die. I will die!

730
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:41,631
The Monkey! The Monkey will kill me!

731
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:43,781
He will kill us all. Kill us all!

732
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:45,371
We all die!

733
01:03:45,371 --> 01:03:46,851
He will kill us all. He will kill us all.

734
01:03:46,851 --> 01:03:48,601
He will kill us all.

735
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:20,121
[Moonshine]

736
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:22,801
Did you know all along?

737
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:24,211
Can you not leave it alone?

738
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:26,671
Those who did nothing wrong became criminals

739
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:29,381
and those who did not have to die died!

740
01:04:29,381 --> 01:04:31,431
You are under arrest.

741
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:32,681
The Monkey.

742
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:34,961
That was you, Chief Royal Secretary?

743
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:39,331
Your father and I were friends with the same dream.

744
01:04:39,331 --> 01:04:41,571
I have sacrificed myself to do this.

745
01:04:41,571 --> 01:04:43,171
How about Woon Sim?

746
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:47,381
Do you know the meaning hidden behind the Nab Sin symbol on Kang Ro Seo's open letter?

747
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:48,941
What do you mean?

748
01:04:48,941 --> 01:04:50,981
Nam Young will have to die so the others can live.

749
01:04:50,981 --> 01:04:52,771
So Princess Consort—

750
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:54,011
How...

751
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:55,871
How could you do such a thing?

752
01:04:55,871 --> 01:04:57,431
Execute the criminals.

753
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:59,501
No!

754
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:01,821
No!

755
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:04,521
What will you do now?

756
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:07,111
Now the real fight begins.
