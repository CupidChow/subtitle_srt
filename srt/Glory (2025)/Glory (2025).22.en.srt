[Glory]

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,960
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,229
The whereabouts of Madam Yang

4
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,920
was deliberately passed on to me.

5
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,430
Someone in the Rong family wants
to harm you.

6
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,890
You'd better make
preparations in advance.

7
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,840
Mr. Yan is a true gentleman.

8
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,190
He is a perfect match for you.

9
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,220
Bao, I really must leave now.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,950
Please take good care of yourself.

11
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,480
Young Master.

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Young Master!

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,480
My dear niece,

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,890
I will take my leave now.

15
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,290
Don't listen to his nonsense.

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,600
I understand.

17
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,290
Mr. Wen speaks his mind frankly.

18
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,560
Lady Shanbao,
please don't take it to heart.

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,190
Now that the Wei case is already settled,

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,030
Madam Yang...

21
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,970
She says she is done with worldly affairs

22
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,700
and has no attachment
to this world anymore.

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,560
In three days, she will take vows
at Jijian Nunnery.

24
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,670
She's becoming a nun?

25
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,590
The Emperor has issued an imperial edict,

26
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,700
appointing you
as the new Prefect of Linji.

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,940
So many wealthy families
have hosted banquets,

28
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,340
vying for your presence.

29
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,750
Introduction letters for potential matches

30
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,520
have been flooding in,

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,050
piling up at your doorstep.

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,079
Women of every grace and charm

33
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,520
are all within your reach.

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,320
Why must you suffer here in vain?

35
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,420
You know she will surely come?

36
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,370
Madam Yang will take vows
at Jijian Nunnery.

37
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,430
She will surely come to see Madam Yang.

38
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,030
The Rong family sees you
as a mortal enemy,

39
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,960
desperate to eliminate you at all costs.

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,420
Even if she comes, so what?

41
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,190
Do you really think
she could ever forgive you?

42
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,870
As the saying goes,
there are plenty of fish...

43
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,520
You only know the saying

44
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,310
that there are plenty of fish in the sea.

45
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,970
Yet you miss the painful truth

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,190
that sometimes

47
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,850
you just can't get over the one
that has got away.

48
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,240
As for what's between her and me,

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
even if I told you, a blockhead like you

50
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,170
wouldn't get it.

51
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,250
I won't waste my breath on you.

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,870
Ms. Liang.

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,360
Ms. Liang.

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,090
Lady Yunwan.

55
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,590
Ms. Liang, why are you ignoring me?

56
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,280
Ms. Liang!

57
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,360
Ms. Liang!

58
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,280
-Lady Yunwan.
-Ms. Liang, look at me!

59
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,520
Ms. Liang, look at me!

60
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:14,960
Lady Yunwan.

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,750
Ms. Liang!

62
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,870
Lady Yunwan.

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,269
Let me go!

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,680
-Ms. Liang!
-It's all right.

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,540
It's all right.

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,920
Ms. Liang!

67
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,920
Lady Yunwan.

68
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,510
Ms. Liang!

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,920
-Ms. Liang!
-It's all right.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,050
Everything's fine.

71
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Ms. Liang!

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,310
Ms. Liang!

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,040
Ms. Liang!

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Ms. Liang!

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,450
Lady Yunwan.

76
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,510
Ms. Liang!

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,680
Let me go!

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,870
-It's all right.
-Ms. Liang!

79
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,750
It's all right.

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,520
Lady Shanbao.

81
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,270
I've tried my best,

82
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,470
but I still can't persuade Lady Yunwan.

83
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,870
She refuses to go down the mountain
with us.

84
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,470
Let her stay here a while longer.

85
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,870
Godmother,

86
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,870
I hope that for the rest of your life,

87
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,020
you'll be free from worry and resentment,

88
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,950

That's not enough!

99
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,610
Swear it on your life and future.

100
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,070

a shortened life

109
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,340

the punishment of my oath, do you?

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,580
Go back now.

114
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,280
And do not come to see me again.

115
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,360
♪ Drifting with the passing years ♪

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,020

belongs to you.

138
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,800
I act only

according to my conscience.

140
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
I've never feared any karmic retribution.

141
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,380
Bao, since you are afraid,

142
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,950
I'll take an oath right here,
in front of the Bodhisattva.

143
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,549
If there truly is karmic reward
for good deeds in this world,

144
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,750
Bodhisattva, I pray you grant Lady Shanbao

145
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,150
blessings, longevity, peace and health.

146
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,960
As for the bitter retribution

147
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,669
of a shortened life and a terrible death,

148
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,000
let me bear it all alone.

149
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,550
If you stop pestering me,

150
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,320
that will be my karmic reward.

151
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,780
Let go of me.

152
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,380
I won't!

153
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,640
Lu Jianglai.

154
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,200
Now that you've taken the road
to high office,

155
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,670
you can't come to see me anymore.

156
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,840
You can't have it both ways.

157
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,390
To hell with high office!

158
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,480
Had I wanted power and fortune,

159
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,910
I wouldn't have cared

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,570
about the fate of the Wei clan.

161
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,320
Yes,

162
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,910
I am ruthless

163
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,270
and calculating.

164
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,360
But if I don't want to collude

165
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,390
with those corrupt
and incompetent officials,

166
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,120
I must be

167
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,380
more cunning than them

168
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,240
to beat them at their own game

169
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,900
and secure the justice I seek.

170
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,090
Bao, you're right.

171
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,590
I want to have it both ways.

172
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,720
I will see this case through to the end.

173
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,200
And...

174
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,620
I will never let you go.

175
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,060
You can beat me or kill me as you please.

176
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,260
But even if I die,

177
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,480
my spirit will cling to you
and never let you go.

178
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,000
Even if you summon

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,630
every god in heaven to your side,

180
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,490
you still won't be able to stop me.

181
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,670
Good.

182
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,840
You said it.

183
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,320
On that misty mountain peak,

184
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,120
there's an ancient wild tea tree

185
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,030
growing on a steep cliff.

186
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,910
It's bathed in the essence
of sun and moon

187
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,550
and nurtured by the spirit
of mountains and rivers.

188
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,750
Legend says its tea can cure dysentery,

189
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,320
making the tea leaves
more valuable than gold.

190
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,960
During every tea-picking season,

191
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,390
many mountain folk risk their lives
to climb the peak for the leaves.

192
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,590
Scarcely one in ten makes it back alive.

193
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
If you get the leaves yourself

194
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,510
and bring them to me,

195
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,390
no matter how grave your mistakes
have been,

196
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,990
we can still work things out.

197
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,590
Do you really mean it?

198
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,960
You're not just saying that?

199
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,010
Every word is true.

200
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,570
Good. I will definitely get them for you.

201
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,120
It has been two days

202
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,230
since we parted at the court.

203
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,440
I just want you to know

204
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,130
I've been thinking of you.

205
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,870
It's alright now.

206
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,910
I've missed the best hour
for tea-picking today.

207
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,440
I'll go up the mountain
first thing tomorrow.

208
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,150
Wait for me.

209
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,840
Lady Rong Shanbao

210
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,840
really knows how to make people suffer.

211
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,390
We've asked every hunter
at the foot of the mountain,

212
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,910
but none of them has ever heard

213
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,840
of any tea tree on the mountain top.

214
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,270
This is probably a wild goose chase,

215
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,720
but you're taking it seriously!

216
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,490
Beauty is but skin deep.

217
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,200
All passions are phantoms,

218
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
yet you're just blinded!

219
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,390
If the tea tree really grows
on that sheer cliff,

220
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,190
then she's asking for your life!

221
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,150
In this life,

222
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,080
fame, fortune, glory and wealth

223
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,340
are all just phantoms.

224
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,360
To fulfill my lofty ambitions,

225
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,120
I can endure ten years
of shame and humiliation,

226
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
living in austerity and privation.

227
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,910
For my beloved,

228
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,720
a little suffering
is a small price to pay.

229
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,360
If Rong Shanbao

230
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,490
truly wants my life,

231
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,670
then she'll have to offer
something far more precious in return.

232
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,720
Something more precious?

233
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,780
What would that be?

234
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,840
Her heart,

235
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,120
the rest of her life

236
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,450
and everything she has.

237
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,610
I'll accept nothing less.

238
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,200
You're quite black-hearted.

239
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
You two are truly a match.

240
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,450
Let me rest for a while.

241
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Just a moment.

242
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,850
I told you not to follow me.

243
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,670
Once it's past 9 AM,

244
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,390
I'll miss the best time for tea-picking.

245
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,120
I can't wait.

246
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,670
Wait for me!

247
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,630
What is this?

248
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,030
You damn monkey.

249
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,320
You damn monkey!

250
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
How dare you duck!

251
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,270
I...

252
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,670
Wait for me!

253
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,050
Where's Lord Lu?

254
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,720
He went up the mountain.

255
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,800
♪ Get caught in a heavy, wild snowfall ♪

256
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,610
♪ Watch magpies fluttering past my eyes ♪

257
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,080
♪ It's tormenting itself all alone ♪

258
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,190
If one day, Mr. Lu turns
against the Rong family,

259
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,950
♪ Unable to find any peers
for a get-together ♪

260
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,460
he will become my enemy.

261
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640
I will sever all ties with him

262
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,960
♪ Wait for a perfectly full moon ♪

263
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,160
and show him no mercy.

264
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,570
That's not enough!

265
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,270
♪ Yet every slice of it seems incomplete ♪

266
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,270
If that day comes,

267
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,140
I want you to punish him
with your own hands.

268
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,200
♪ Is it because my prayers
are too presumptuous? ♪

269
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,030
If you hesitate for even a moment,

270
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,350
you are not worthy to be a daughter
of our Rong family.

271
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,120
♪ Or do I lack a bit
of the sacrificial blood? ♪

272
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,170

♪ Put an end to all karmic ties and sins ♪

282
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,850
Why the hesitation?

283
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,440
Why are you here?

284
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,440
Grandmother ordered you
to kneel in the ancestral hall.

285
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,300
What was it for?

286
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,240
She wanted you to see

287
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,840
the fate of that wretched servant.

288
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,120
In the past, anyone who dared to sell

289
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,030
the salt or gold mines
their tribe depended on

290
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,670
would be tried and hanged publicly.

291
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,510
Even if the chief's husband
betrayed the tribe,

292
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,200
he would be thrown into a scorpion pit,

293
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,800
his survival left to chance.

294
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,440
He was a spy
who infiltrated the Rong family

295
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,590
to gather information.

296
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,190
It was you who saved his life.

297
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
Even if he falls and shatters to pieces,

298
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,370
it'll only be repaying his debt to you.

299
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,670
If you can't bear to do it,

300
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,190
I can do it on your behalf.

301
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,720
It's not that I can't bear to do it.

302
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Still denying it?

303
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,680
You are not the only daughter
of the Rong family.

304
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,210
If you hesitate any longer,

305
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,150
you will surely ruin the important matter.

306
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,010
Think about my mother.

307
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,349
Grandmother doted on her

308
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,480
beyond all measure.

309
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,550
But since she insisted
on marrying far from home,

310
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,500
for all these years,

311
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,160
has Grandmother ever mentioned her
even once?

312
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,640
She was no longer part of the Rong family.

313
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,589
After she died, she couldn't be buried
in the family grave.

314
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,750
Even I, as her daughter,

315
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,079
become an outsider now,

316
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,480
not worthy of being recorded
in the genealogy.

317
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,510
So what?

318
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,410
So what?

319
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,200
Rong Shanbao.

320
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,110
When you were 13 or 14,

321
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,320
you followed the tea caravan to the border
for training.

322
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,640
In three years, you only stayed home
for 20 days.

323
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,480
Driving camels, judging horses
and speaking tribal tongues...

324
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,740
You mastered them all.

325
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,130
Once, you got separated from the caravan.

326
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,590
You fought tooth and nail
to find a water source,

327
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,160
and on your own, led

328
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,020
several camels back to the group.

329
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,590
Not a single item was lost.

330
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,270
You even traded tea bricks for 30 sheep,

331
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,790
earning 100 extra taels of silver.

332
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,240
Back then,
whenever Grandmother mentioned you,

333
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,840
she was bursting with pride.

334
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,270
But now?

335
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
For Lu Jianglai

336
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,270
and an outsider like Madam Yang,

337
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,350
you willingly turned your back
on Grandmother.

338
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:10,960
You have failed

339
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,680
the Rong family that has spared no effort
to cultivate you.

340
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,270
You have failed

341
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,030
the tea farmers
who worship you as the Tea Bone.

342
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,110
Most of all, you've

343
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,270
failed yourself!

344
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,270
Whether family honor
or personal romance

345
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,220
weighs more heavily

346
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,170
is for you to decide yourself.

347
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,900
Xiangling.

348
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,210
This isn't about family honor

349
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,810
and personal romance.

350
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,430
Yes, I am upset with Lu Jianglai.

351
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,590
I'm angry that he acted on his own

352
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,520
and deceived me.

353
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,230
But he didn't do anything wrong.

354
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,400
He infiltrated the Rong family
to investigate a case.

355
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,440
He was willing to set me aside temporarily

356
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,040
for the justice in his heart,

357
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,090
just as I did for my godmother.

358
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,740
Knowing the grievances she carried,

359
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,920
I set aside all favor temporarily

360
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,110
to protect her.

361
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,230
So about this matter,

362
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,770
though I'm angry with him,

363
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,720
I understand him.

364
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,070
I'm grateful that

365
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,790
on this point,

366
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,710
he and I see eye to eye.

367
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,990
The Rong family and Linji

368
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,310
are interdependent
like branches and leaves.

369
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm guarding the Rong family's future,

370
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,360
while he's protecting Linji's future.

371
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,860
If Linji falls into darkness,

372
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,680
the Rong family
will also be plunged into darkness.

373
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
Isn't that right?

374
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,840
I know you care for me,

375
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,100
and that you hope

376
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,880
once I become the head of the Rong family,

377
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,350
I'll help you reclaim your surname

378
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,350
and have your name recorded
in our genealogy.

379
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,670
Xiangling, I will keep the promise

380
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,550
I made to you.

381
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,460
Let's go back.

382
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,270
Ms. Liang.

383
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,550
I picked all these

384
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,510
from the backyard.

385
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,970
Look, aren't they pretty?

386
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,510
They are.

387
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,120
This leaf is even prettier.

388
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,920
Look at it.

389
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,000
Lady Yunwan.

390
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,930
By the stream at the back hill,

391
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,940
there's a beautiful red maple tree,

392
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,440
more splendid than spring flowers
in February.

393
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,030
Could you pick a leaf for me?

394
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,480
Please?

395
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,920
Wait for me, Ms. Liang.
I'll be right back.

396
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,480
Wanwan.

397
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,960
Watch your step. Don't trip and fall.

398
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,810
[Rong Mansion]

399
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,890
Lord Lu, you've come at a bad time.

400
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,550
There's an outbreak of tea plant disease
in the plantations after the rain.

401
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,400
Lady Shanbao
has gone up to the tea mountain.

402
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,550
Based on previous years,

403
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,640
she might be gone for 3 to 5 days,

404
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,300
or even 10 days to half a month.

405
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,430
It's impossible to say for certain.

406
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,270
I dare not have you wait in vain, My Lord.

407
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,640
Save these excuses.

408
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,480
I've had a prior arrangement

409
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,540
with Lady Shanbao.

410
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,060
Just take this basket inside.

411
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,610
And tell her I have a way

412
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,510
to bring the cliff tea
she's been longing for

413
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,750
down from the mountain.

414
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,610
She will naturally come to see me.

415
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,060
Take it inside now.

416
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,030
The marten fur cloak
you just started wearing yesterday

417
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,690
got torn as soon as we went out.

418
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,680
What a pity!

419
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,440
Actually, this old one

420
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,030
is more comfortable to wear.

421
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,110
The late autumn air is quite cold.

422
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,720
The old one isn't warm enough.

423
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,750
I'm just worried that you'll

424
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,640
catch a chill.

425
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,130
What's this for?

426
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,550
Mr. Yan,

427
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,590
someone delivered this

428
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,110
to our gate early this morning

429
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,510
Steward Cheng just told me
to throw it away.

430
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
There are quite a few

431
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,790
freshly cut twigs inside it.

432
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,790
Why throw it away?

433
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,380
This...

434
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,670
Leave it to me.

435
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,770
What are you two doing?

436
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,200
Lady Shanbao.

437
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,330
I told you not to meddle.

438
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,380
These cuttings need to be planted
at a slant.

439
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,790
But I did everything

440
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,120
exactly as you instructed, Young Master.

441
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,290
Mr. Yan, you're an expert at growing tea,

442
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,510
yet you have an attendant

443
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,510
who knows next to nothing about tea.

444
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,820
Watch closely.

445
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,880
The northwest wind
is blowing strong right now.

446
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,960
We should position the leaves
so that they follow the wind direction.

447
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,310
If the wind is too strong,
the leaves will fall off.

448
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,310
The leaf buds on this branch
aren't full enough.

449
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,550
It's difficult for the cutting
to take root.

450
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:22,920
I...

451
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Wild tea trees grow on steep cliffs.

452
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,510
Even plucking their leaves
is a perilous task,

453
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,040
let alone cutting branches
for propagation.

454
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,680
Someone risked their life
to obtain the precious tea.

455
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,440
I thought

456
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,310
it would be too wasteful
to throw them away.

457
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,240
So I brought them here to have a try.

458
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,360
Lord Lu has come to visit.

459
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,190
Why didn't anyone inform me?

460
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,790
It seems that someone, seeing

461
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,480
I've lost Grandmother's favor,

462
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,740
now thinks they can dismiss me entirely.

463
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,640
So many have fallen to their deaths

464
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,550
picking tea leaves on those cliffs.

465
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,280
He really does have great luck.

466
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,810
Lady Shanbao.

467
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,680
He has been waiting for you outside

468
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,940
for two hours already.

469
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,920
Lady Shanbao, you've always been true
to your word and deed.

470
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,590
When have you ever

471
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,850
gone back on your word?

472
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,720
You promised to meet him.

473
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,870
How can you break your promise?

474
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,340
Go to meet him.

475
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,070
What a pity.

476
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,860
He personally said he had a way

477
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,960
to bring the precious cliff tea

478
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,290
down from the mountain.

479
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,250
Since you refuse to see him,

480
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,680
this tea tree will

481
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,990
-have to stay...
-Mr. Yan.

482
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,640
Thank you.

483
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,240
Young Master, you're too silly.

484
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,160
You got your hands all muddy,

485
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,820
doing all this work
for someone else's benefit.

486
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,680
What's easily gained

487
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,840
is never rare or special.

488
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,490
Only what everyone yearns for
but can't have

489
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,790
is truly precious.

490
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,850
Let's get back to work.

491
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,890
My Lord, I have urgent news to report.

492
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,710
[Rong Mansion]

493
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,150
Go up the mountain immediately.

494
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,470
Has he already left?

495
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,150
Lady Shanbao.

496
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,710
Mr. Lu asked me to tell you

497
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,770
something terrible had happened
at Jijian Nunnery.

498
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,190
Hurry up and go up the mountain
to check it out.

499
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,110
Prepare a horse.

500
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,510
Yes.

501
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,400
Where are you going?

502
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,240
Come inside with me.

503
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,440
Remove the body.

504
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,610
You're here.

505
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,890
What happened?

506
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,960
When the nuns gathered
for evening prayers,

507
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,070
they noticed she was nowhere to be seen.

508
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,200
Later they found out
something bad had happened.

509
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,440
The coroner has examined the body.

510
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,370
There were no wounds on her body

511
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,490
and no signs of poisoning.

512
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,080
It has been confirmed she hanged herself.

513
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,160
Madam Yang made an excuse
to send Lady Yunwan away.

514
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,350
Then she hanged herself alone in her room.

515
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,520
When Lady Yunwan arrived here,

516
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,320
the nuns
had already taken down Madam Yang's body.

517
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,750
I was afraid Lady Yunwan
would make a scene and cause disruption,

518
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,880
so I ordered someone

519
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,590
to forcibly take her away to have a rest.

520
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,920
What she had desperately tried to protect

521
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,780
was ultimately lost.

522
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,310
If she finds this out,

523
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,080
I can't imagine how heartbroken she'll be.

524
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,440
Take everyone from the nunnery

525
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,170
back to the Government Office!

526
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,660
I'll question them one by one.

527
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,310
Grandmother, Yunwan is a member
of the Rong family.

528
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,880
She shouldn't stay
on the mountain for long.

529
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,080
Grandmother, please

530
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,240
allow me to bring her back soon.

531
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,580
You know whether you're going
to Jijian Nunnery

532
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,210
because of Wanwan

533
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,920
or out of concern for Madam Yang's safety.

534
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,720
I only have one question for you.

535
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,860
I've told you
to reflect on your mistake these days.

536
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,200
Do you realize where you went wrong?

537
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,510
Grandmother, I have taken

538
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,920
your words to heart.

539
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,440
From now on, for everything I do,

540
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,200
I will first seek your instruction.

541
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,460
I'll never act on my own

542
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,880
or do things recklessly.

543
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,830
It's good
that you've realized your mistake.

544
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,630
Since Madam Yang has taken vows,

545
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,070
she has cut all ties with the mortal world

546
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,820
and is no longer your godmother.

547
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,820
As for Wanwan,

548
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,280
our Rong family
has already held a funeral for her.

549
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,270
Everyone knows

550
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,830
that Lady Yunwan of the Rong family
is dead.

551
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,030
It's better this way.

552
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:06,960
Such

553
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,270
a foolish child

554
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,680
should never have been born
into the Rong family.

555
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,880
She herself suffered

556
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,590
and also disgraced the whole family.

557
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,590
All these years,

558
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,830
as her elder sister,

559
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,400
you have spent so much effort

560
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,200
and endured so much ridicule for her.

561
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Outsiders might even think

562
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,400
that our Rong family
must have committed terrible sins

563
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,590
to have raised

564
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,480
such an ignorant and shameful child.

565
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,740
I think there's no need to bring her back.

566
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,240
Let her remain on the mountain
to recuperate in peace.

567
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,590
I will send someone else

568
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,590
to deliver all her daily necessities.

569
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,830
You'd better act
as if you never had this sibling.

570
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,110
Focus all your attention
on the matters of the tea plantations.

571
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,910
Grandmother.

572
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,720
Yunwan is a daughter of the Rong family,

573
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,350
my own blood sister.

574
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,880
How could I bear to leave her

575
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
stranded for good
in that lonely nunnery on the mountain

576
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,320
and never allow her
to return the Rong Mansion?

577
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,850
You claim
that you've realized your mistake!

578
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,590
But I see you're clearly incorrigible.

579
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,400
Grandmother.

580
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,350
Shut up!

581
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,030
I was reckless.

582
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,480
Grandmother, please calm down.

583
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,180
But Wanwan...

584
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,070
Old Madam Rong.

585
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,030
Old Madam Rong,
there's a message from the mountain.

586
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,590
It says

587
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,050
Madam Yang has hanged herself and died.

588
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,890
No. That can't be true.

589
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
How pitiful.

590
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,410
She had clung to a wretched life
for ten years,

591
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,660
but in the end, she still couldn't escape

592
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,990
her destined calamity.

593
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,510
This shows
every person has their own destiny.

594
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,240
Now matter how capable you are,

595
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,170
you still can't stop destiny.

596
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
For her,

597
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,710
it was actually an end to her suffering.

598
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,000
If you feel compassion for her,

599
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,270
then spend more money

600
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
and give her a proper burial.

601
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,790
Grandmother, Yunwan
has just suffered this sudden misfortune.

602
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,320
She must be very terrified.

603
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,310
Grandmother, I beg you to allow me

604
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,830
to go up the mountain immediately

605
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,890
and bring her back.

606
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,400
I've told you
that you're not allowed to go!

607
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Stop right there!

608
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,440
Rong Shanbao.

609
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,620
Have you forgotten the rules
of the Rong family?

610
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,070
Grandmother.

611
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,030
Our Rong ancestors belonged
to a matrilineal clan.

612
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,160
We honor women,

613
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,190
and we never look down on men.

614
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
The men of the clan hunted and fought,

615
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,720
while the women took care of their homes.

616
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,250
Together, they built a land

617
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,730
of peace and tranquility.

618
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,070
That land was once vast.

619
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,550
It was so vast that it could

620
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,080
shelter countless people.

621
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
When destitute strangers arrived,

622
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,270
they could get clean food,

623
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,960
warm clothes,

624
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,930
and even a piece of land.

625
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,510
From then on,

626
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,240
they became

627
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,480
members of our clan.

628
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,990
These heartwarming stories

629
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,070
were all told to me by you.

630
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,240
It was you

631
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,510
who made our ancestors my ideals.

632
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,950
You always talk about rules,

633
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,350
but the laws of the jungle

634
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,030
and those self-serving doctrines

635
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,710
have never been our rules.

636
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,280
By our rules,

637
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:14,000
we would never cast aside frail elders

638
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,260
or disabled children,

639
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,280
would never disdain

640
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,030
a sister who is mentally challenged,

641
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,760
would never turn away

642
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,670
a granddaughter who has traveled so far

643
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,670
to find her roots,

644
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,920
and would never, knowing

645
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,150
a woman is innocent,

646
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,480
stand idly by and watch her

647
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,070
suffer injustice and be driven to despair.

648
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,070
Never.

649
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,010
You!

650
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,590
How dare you accuse me,

651
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,110
your own grandmother!

652
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,280
Shanbao,

653
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,400
how can you speak to Grandmother
like this?

654
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,130
Apologize to Grandmother now.

655
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,790
Hurry!
Don't you see you're driving me mad?

656
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,620
Grandmother,

657
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,020
I was wrong.

658
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,070
My mistake was

659
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,040
being blindly obedient and filial

660
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,380
and not speaking my mind sooner.

661
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,160
You scolded my father and my uncles

662
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,000
for abandoning their families,

663
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,060
chasing after fame

664
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,800
and leaving the tea plantations behind.

665
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
But you yourself,

666
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
over these years,

667
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,880
have also strayed

668
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,550
too far.

669
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,800
You value power

670
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,280
and prestige

671
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,550
more than your own family.

672
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,230
You value them

673
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,720
more than your granddaughters
bound to you by blood.

674
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,840
It has been so long

675
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,920
since you told us

676
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,030
about the sacred mountains
in our homeland,

677
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,230
the ancient palaces,

678
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,630
and that queen

679
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,940
who would sit under the cypress tree

680
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,070
teaching children

681
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,400
how to make tea bricks.

682
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,720
Where are you going?

683
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,280
I'm going to gather the remains

684
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,920
of a poor woman

685
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,070
and bring my sister home.

686
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,070
How dare you defy Grandmother like this!

687
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,370
It's utterly disrespectful!

688
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,040
Shut up!

689
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,800
Rong Shanbao.

690
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,330
If you go out now,

691
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,480
you know

692
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
what you'll lose.

693
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,890
If you dare step out of that door,

694
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,100
you'll never be allowed back!

695
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,440
I started the new tea plantations

696
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,900
on Green Mountain myself.

697
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,680
I'll live there from now on.

698
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,070
But I will always be

699
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,620
a daughter of the Rong family

700
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,020
and your granddaughter.

701
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,110
Whenever the Rong family needs me

702
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,330
or whenever you miss me,

703
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,560
I will come back.

704
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,150
Are you going to turn against me too?

705
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,300
Old Madam Rong!

706
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,370
Old Madam Rong!

707
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,320
Grandmother!

708
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,180
Old Madam Rong!

709
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,300
Old Madam Rong!

710
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,380
Old Madam Rong!

711
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,360
My Lord.

712
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,280
Why isn't Madam Yang's name

713
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,880
inscribed on her tombstone?

714
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,030
The Yang family accused her
of being unfilial and disrespectful.

715
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,030
Outsiders blamed her
for lacking wifely virtue

716
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,690
and refusing to be compliant.

717
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,880
They thought this brought the disaster

718
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,480
to the Wei and Yang families.

719
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,800
Shanbao fears

720
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,320
someone might deliberately damage
the grave

721
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,920
and disturb the peace of the deceased.

722
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,080
If the Wei family had not bullied
Madam Yang

723
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,210
and the Yang family had not brought
false charges,

724
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,070
nothing bad would have occurred.

725
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,120
Those people are truly shameless!

726
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,710
Shanbao.

727
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,190
Shanbao.

728
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,260
When Grandmother learned

729
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,710
that you personally brought the body back

730
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,770
from the Government Office for burial,

731
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,170
she was utterly enraged.

732
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,440
Yunxi

733
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,280
and Xiangling pleaded on your behalf.

734
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,670
They were both severely scolded
by Grandmother.

735
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,670
Grandmother even forbade everyone
in the mansion

736
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,530
from having any contact with you.

737
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,010
Grandmother has also said

738
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,080
that those tea plantations you own

739
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,280
are not allowed to operate

740
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
under the Rong family's name.

741

Shanbao.

742
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,150
You should come back with me

743
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,880
and apologize to Grandmother.

744
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,840
Grandmother loves you
and values you deeply.

745
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
She has spared no effort
in nurturing you all these years.

746
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
If you're willing to go back
and apologize,

747
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,510
you'll still be

748
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,370
the noble lady of the Rong family.

749
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,190
You won't have to live out here
in the wilderness,

750
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,590
exposed to the elements.

751
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,550
We women of the Rong family
start our education at four.

752
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,120
The very first lesson we learn

753
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,920
is that we don't follow the ruler

754
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,920
or our elders,

755
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,110
but moral conscience

756
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
and true justice.

757
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,070
I've said everything
that needs to be said.

758
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,840
It's not that I don't want to be filial.

759
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,630
It's that Grandmother is angry with me

760
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,190
and won't let me go back home.

761
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,000
Yunshu, you're gentle and obedient,

762
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,320
devoting yourself wholeheartedly
to serving Grandmother.

763
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,760
In the days to come, please take care
of Grandmother in my place

764
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,820
and bring comfort and joy to her side.

765
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,330
Lady Shanbao, how could I compare to you?

766
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,230
I am not the legitimate heir.

767
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,770
And my mother was a maid.

768
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,710
I do not acknowledge distinctions of birth

769
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,040
or social hierarchies.

770
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,030
Your parents were a perfect couple.

771
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,280
You are your father's only daughter

772
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,400
and my dear cousin.

773
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,030
However,

774
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,190
Yunshu, you have chosen a difficult path.

775
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,850
Please take good care of yourself
in the future.

776
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,480
Shanbao, what are you talking about?

777
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,710
I mean

778
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,320
it's getting dark
and the mountain path is dangerous.

779
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,190
Yunshu, your eyesight isn't good,

780
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,390
so you must be extra careful
with your steps.

781
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,720
You'd better head down the mountain soon.

782
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,190
Thank you for your concern, Shanbao.

783
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,450
I'll keep that in mind.

784
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,580
Shanbao, please take good care
of yourself too.

00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,400
Just now, did you notice

788
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,920
how Yunshu reacted when she saw

789
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:54,930
that new grave?

790
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,070
Lady Yunshu is blind.

791
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,440
What could she possibly have seen?

792
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,670
But Lady Shanbao,

793
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,710
who exactly was this Lin Pingxiang?

794
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,510
Why did you come here specially

795
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,280
to choose an auspicious burial site
for her

796
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,630
and specifically instructed someone

797
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,290
to plant February Orchids
in front of the grave?

798
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,360
Don't worry, Godmother.

799
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,800
From now on,

800
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,320
I will definitely take good care
of Wanwan.

801
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,710
As for the one who has been

802
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,910
stirring up trouble behind the scenes,

803
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,010
I will never let them get away with it.

804
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,560
Young Master.

805
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,840
You've been waiting eagerly for so long.

806
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,800
Are you really leaving
without even meeting

807
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,590
Lady Shanbao?

808
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,550
Her top priority right now

809
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,950
is not personal romance.

810
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,960
It's to bring the real culprit

811
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,510
who killed Madam Yang to justice
as soon as possible.

812
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,710
By my duty and by my feelings,

813
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,630
I can no longer let this person

814
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,560
remain at large.

815
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,840
Didn't she hang herself?

816
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,710
How could there be a real culprit?

We already gave our answer yesterday.

After Venerable Huijing took her vows,

822
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,530
she became a Buddhist nun.

you might have missed.

828
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,590
did you notice anything?

Feel free to speak. It's all right.

00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,400
That day I forgot
about the evening prayers.

831

so I dared not mention it.
