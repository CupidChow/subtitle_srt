[Episode 11]

3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,520
Mr. Yan, watch your step.

4
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,680
Why are you so surprised?

5
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,150
Didn't you know Grandmother

6
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,680
invited me
to admire the moon tonight as well?

7
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,800
I caught a cold yesterday.

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm afraid of passing it to Old Madam.

9
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,520
Lady Yunxi,
please convey my apologies to her.

10
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,970
I'll take my leave now.

11
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,360
If you leave,

12
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,920
how will I explain this?

13
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,120
In families like ours,

14
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,220
when have we ever
decided our own marriages?

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,230
Or perhaps hold yourself so high

16
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,380
that you look down on me?

17
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,560
Lady Yunxi, you have extraordinary beauty

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,960
and exceptional talent.

19
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,030
How could I dare to have

20
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,870
even the slightest contempt for you?

21
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,590
Yan Bailou,

22
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,290
do you truly insist on having her?

23
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,890
Back in the mountains,

24
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,170
I often tried to gain enlightenment
like my senior brothers.

25
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,910
But being naturally slow-witted,

26
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,310
I never gained anything.

27
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,079
One night,

28
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,310
I climbed to the mountaintop alone
and sat there.

29
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,000
Seeing a bright star,
I suddenly became enlightened.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,930
I was overjoyed.

31
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,470
This star holds

32
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,960
extraordinary meaning for me.

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
Lady Yunxi, though
you're as radiant as the bright moon

34
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
and as dazzling as dawn's glow,

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,360
you're ultimately not

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
the star that brought me enlightenment.

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,480
Forgive my rudeness.

38
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,430
This man speaks like a Buddhist,

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,770
but his mind is unfathomably deep.

40
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,380
He's not easy to control.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,380
I'm determined to find
someone understanding,

42
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,840
gentle, and considerate.

43
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,750
I don't want to marry

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,470
a monk with hair.

45
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,590
Tell Grandmother for me,

46
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,920
such an oddity

47
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,490
is not to my liking.

48
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,120
Lady Yunxi!

49
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,000
Even with a body of iron and steel,

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,560
can you ward off all misfortunes?

51
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,290
Young Master, you must be
more careful next time.

52
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,079
Is it here or there?

53
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,170
It's not even swollen.

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,960
Who says it's not swollen?

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,280
Isn't this... This...

56
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,670
Didn't your rubbing just fix it?

57
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,090
Go fetch me some hot water.

58
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:02,940
Alright.

[Rong's Ancestral Temple]

78
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,530
You kept me waiting all day in vain.

79
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,630
Do you have nothing to say?

80
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,740
Do you want to marry me?

81
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
Are you having second thoughts?

82
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,430
You personally agreed

83
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,870
in front of everyone.

84
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,160
If you go back on your word now,

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,490
breaking your promise,

86
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,360
how will the Rong family

Rong Shanbao,

90
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,000
I have no interest

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,390
in admiring your family's ancestral hall.

92
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,909
Where did you go today?

93
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Do you know how long I've waited?

94
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,530
I'm asking you.

95
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,190
Didn't the Yang family tell you

96
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,780
that to enter the Rong family,

97
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,240
you must first control your temper

98
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,360
and be obedient?

99
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,390
Or perhaps

100
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,960
they sent their son here

101
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,720
deliberately to make enemies with us?

102
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,490
You should understand your position
before speaking.

103
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,400
I've seen many ancestral halls.

104
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,570
What's so special about the Rong family's?

105
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,549
This pair of dragon and phoenix pillars

106
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,440
were originally two ancient trees

107
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,909
growing on a cliff.

108
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,050
They embraced each other,

109
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,920
interdependent for 1,000 years,

110
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
weathering countless storms,

111
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,970
being lush and prosperous.

112
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,180
Even their roots grew together as one.

113
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,790
Yet ignorant villagers

114
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,190
managed to cut them down.

115
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,500
Our ancestors were deeply saddened,

116
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,230
paid a fortune to acquire them,

117
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,840
transported them
thousands of miles to Linji,

118
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,320
and sought master craftsmen of the time

119
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
to carve them into
the male and female pillars.

120
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,850
The right pillar is female;

121
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,480
the left pillar is male.

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,520
They're the foundation
of the Rong family.

123
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,270
We must come to worship
on the first day of every month,

124
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,400
so that the descendants remember
the Rong family's ancestral teachings.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,530
What ancestral teachings?

126
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,130
The male and female pillars

127
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,360
which share the same root and origin
accompany and sustain each other,

128
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,750
and neither can be missing.

129
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,010
People are like trees,

130
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,670
all born from nature

131
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,870
and return to nature.

132
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,150
For a family to flourish

133
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,870
and prosper forever,

134
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,790
one must find

135
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,150
a compatible partner,

136
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,870
sharing both joys and hardships,
bound together in life and death.

137
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Stop putting on an act in front of me.

138
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,000
The Rong family may deceive others,

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,910
but not me.

140
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,030
Why do women run the household?

141
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,150
Your grandfather is dead,

142
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,840
but your father is still alive.

143
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,130
There's also your second and third uncle.

144
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,130
Why don't any of them run the family?

145
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,320
Why do Rong's women

146
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,650
refuse to hold wedding ceremonies,

147
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,050
yet all the children
bear the Rong surname?

148
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,590
Why was your aunt
who insisted on marrying out

149
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,450
removed from the family registry

150
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,580
and forbidden to return forever?

151
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,960
I know where your Rong family

152
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,480
ancestors came from.

153
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,600
But since you've

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
been here for hundreds of years,

155
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,320
you shouldn't cling to
those outdated rules!

156
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,120
I don't understand

157
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,360
what you're talking about.

158
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,080
My Rong family has adapted
to local customs.

159
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,440
For hundreds of years, we've

160
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,270
followed your rules.

161
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,880
My third uncle has long passed.

162
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,030
My father and second uncle
have successful official careers.

163
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,840
Why should they restrict themselves
to being merchants?

164
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,630
Since it's the woman
who takes a husband into the family,

165
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,960
naturally the children

166
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,380
bear the Rong surname.

167
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,600
As for my aunt—

168
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,030
aren't there many in Linji City
who defy their parents,

169
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,000
elope, get married,

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,460
and have been
expelled from their families?

171
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,600
Mr. Yang,

172
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,390
I brought you here

173
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,390
to tell you:

174
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,680
only men who are truly

175
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,510
recognized by Rong women

176
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,170
can enter the ancestral hall.

177
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
I don't recognize you as my husband.

178
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,630
You will never be able to enter

179
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,160
the Rong's ancestral hall,

180
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:12,870
nor can you

181
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,890
stand by the male pillar for the wedding.

182
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,370
Say that again.

183
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,000
In your words,

184
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,320
even with your threats and bribes,

185
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,580
and all your scheming,

186
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,870
you're not even a concubine.

187
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,510
You have no status

188
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,550
and will gain nothing.

189
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,040
Fine.

190
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,560
But don't forget,

191
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,070
as long as I hold the secret,

192
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,760
you have to be my woman obediently.

193
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,440
You'll never escape this fate.

194
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,950
Think about it.

195
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,310
A secret enough
to destroy the Rong family.

196
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,440
What will you use to shut my mouth?

197
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,870
My public engagement to you

198
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,800
was only to maintain appearances.

199
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,300
Once the truth is exposed,

200
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,440
how could your Yang family
remain unscathed?

201
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,340
Disregarding both families'
reputation and honor

202
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,600
for your personal feelings and grudges?

203
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,210
When that happens,

204
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,580
the first to demand your life

205
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,570
will surely be the Yang family.

206
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,230
I don't care about any of that.

207
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,500
In order to please the Rong family,

208
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,900
they forced me here
by any means necessary.

209
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,750
Why should I

210
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,080
care about their lives?

211
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,670
I've won.

212
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,750
I'm here now.

213
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,320
So you can only be mine.

214
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,340
The 25th is an auspicious day,

215
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,050
and we'll consummate
our wedding that night.

216
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,150
Otherwise, if I risk disgrace
and make a scene,

217
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,240
everyone will lose face.

218
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,040
You're truly beautiful—

219
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,450
beautiful enough to capture my heart.

220
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,060
[Rong Mansion]

221
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,510
Young Master,
why don't we rest for a while?

222
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,440
It won't kill me.

223
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,490
Let's go.

224
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,810
Keep going.

225
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,700
When your leg gets better,

226
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,460
accompany me to offer incense
at my mother's grave.

227
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,870
You mean your mother who was a maid?

228
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,210
Your grandmother despised her.

229
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,740
I advise you not to stir up trouble.

230
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,530
Our marriage

231
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,880
must be reported to our parents.

232
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,600
Even if Grandmother knows about it,

233
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,130
I don't think she will mind.

234
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,040
Mr. He, since you want
to join the Rong family,

235
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,720
are you willing to marry me?

236
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,270
Alright.

237
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,720
Lady Yunshu,

238
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,530
I agreed to this engagement

239
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,000
only as a temporary measure.

240
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,510
You don't actually believe

241
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,430
that I, a noble son of the He family,

242
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,710
would marry a maid's daughter, do you?

243
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
And you want me to offer incense
and pay respects with you?

244
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
Are you even worth it?

245
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Aren't you afraid of
bringing bad luck upon yourself?

246
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,350
Yes, this is such good news.

247
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,320
Let's go.

248
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,630
Come on.

249
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,200
The young master
will scold us if we're late.

250
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,930
Who's there?

251
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,790
My Lady,

252
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,150
they're from the Yang family,

253
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,080
going to Qilan Garden
to prepare the bridal chamber.

254
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,440
Though you're blind,

255
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,470
your mind is quite clear.

256
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,320
Could you not know that Yang Dingchen

257
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,050
is going to marry Rong Shanbao?

258
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,720
Don't worry.

259
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,920
She and I are mortal enemies,

260
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,720
incompatible as fire and water.

261
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,000
I wouldn't deign to spare her a glance.

262
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,680
The spring chill is biting.

263
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,540
Your lady is so sickly.

264
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,800
Take her back inside

265
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,790
before she collapses and blames others.

266
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,180
Such a burden.

267
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,480
Go away!

268
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,560
I'm perfectly fine.

269
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,550
My Lady.

270
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,860
The wind is so strong today.

271
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,930
How many peach blossoms

272
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,670
can withstand such destruction?

273
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,800
Go collect some peach blossom petals.

274
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,590
In all the world,

275
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,350
I've only heard of the bride's family
preparing the marital chamber,

276
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,150
never seen a man so eager to do it.

277
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,750
It's obvious that Lady Shanbao
finds him irritating,

278
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,160
yet he still clings to her.

279
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,690
What a shameless creature.

280
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,240
Isn't this

281
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,220
what she brought upon herself?

282
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,740
What kind of difficulty

283
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,630
could possibly trouble her?

284
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,360
Prepare the chamber.

285
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,460
I...

286
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,250
Manzhu.

287
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,240
Do you people from the Yang family
know proper etiquette?

288
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,200
Our lady's cosmetic case

289
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,460
is not for you to touch!

290
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,590
Lady Shanbao,

291
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,640
last night at midnight,

292
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,890
the spring rain came too suddenly

293
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,830
and flooded the newly dug

294
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,890
drainage ditches.

295
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,270
In the newly opende tea plantation
on the back hill,

296
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,400
the tea workers neglected

297
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,220
to cover the sown

298
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,680
tea seeds with rice straw.

299
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,910
Let's go take a look.

300
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,040
You must return early tonight.

301
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,540
I'll be waiting
to consummate our wedding with you.

302
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,250
Let's go.

303
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,730
Where is Yi?

304
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,870
Why didn't you report earlier?

305
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,000
Why are you all standing there?

306
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,880
Hurry up and get everything ready.

307
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,360
If you ruin my wedding,

308
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,440
I'll skin you alive!

309
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,300
What's this?

310
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,590
Why isn't Mr. He accompanying you?

311
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,920
Leaving you here alone.

312
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,000
Is he

313
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,590
not treating you well?

314
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,720
Since ancient times, the wealthy

315
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,980
have favored peonies.

316
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,720
You scholars

317
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,680
admire pine, bamboo, plum, and orchid.

318
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,750
These peach blossoms
are common everywhere,

319
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,010
vulgar and frivolous,

320
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,880
so naturally they aren't appreciated.

321
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,600
Mr. He is proud by nature.

322
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,160
If he hadn't wanted
to stay with the Rong family,

323
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,090
he would never have proposed to me.

324
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,500
I misunderstood.

325
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,550
Lady Yunshu, you don't need to

326
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,920
use these tactics on me.

327
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,220
Whatever you want me to do to help you,

328
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,230
I'm willing.

329
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:52,920
It's the first time

330
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,580
I've known what you look like.

331
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,860
I'm done. I have things to do.

332
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,340
Don't.

333
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,310
Mr. Yan.

334
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,680
Don't go.

335
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,250
You...

336
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,290
Do you expect

337
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,850
me to just stand by and watch my cousin

338
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,650
fall into the hands of that wolf?

339
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,030
Can't you see?

340
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,000
The Yang family is naturally treacherous.

341
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,640
There must be something fishy going on.

342
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,200
My cousin

343
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,710
doesn't want this at all.

344
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,710
You can't stop it.

345
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,290
Even if I can't, I must try!

346
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,160
If you go now,

347
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,110
you'll only cause more chaos

348
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,210
and add to Lady Shanbao's troubles.

349
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,330
Lady Shanbao has her own plans.

350
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,120
She won't be easily manipulated
by Yang Dingchen.

351
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,030
Let's just wait and see.

352
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,410
You're such

353
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,830
a magnanimous person, aren't you?

354
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,950
Is this what people mean by

355
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,970
"those truly detached from love

356
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,600
knows neither worry nor fear"?

357
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,060
Sometimes I really wonder

358
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,610
if either you don't love my cousin,

359
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,840
or you're made of wood and stone!

360
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,530
You simply don't have a heart!

361
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,580
You don't need to provoke me.

362
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,350
Of course I feel jealousy and resentment.

363
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,730
But I know self-restraint

364
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,650
and not to hurt others.

365
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,510
To vent one's personal emotions

366
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,760
and cause endless trouble for others...

367
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,960
Such terrifying love

368
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,590
will only make you

369
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,920
more despicable

370
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,400
and annoying.

371
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,920
In the end,

372
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,000
everything you love

373
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,270
and long for

374
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,590
will slip away like sand,

375
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,070
never to return.

376
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,160
Miss, you have such good taste.

377
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,890
This looks so beautiful.

378
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,270
This suits you so well.

379
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,440
It's lovely.

380
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,680
This blue is really beautiful.

381
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,480
Let's go to the East Market.

382
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,720
Change course. Head to the dock.

383
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,380
Steward Lu.

384
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,920
Just do as I say.

385
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,390
Change course.

386
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,780
Ms. Yan,

387
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,060
Lady Shanbao hasn't returned yet.

388
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,230
Usually by this time,

389
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,730
Lady Shanbao should be at Chongxi Hall

390
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,390
having dinner with Old Madam.

391
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,280
How has she not returned yet?

392
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,400
Guanyu.

393
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,200
The people who followed her
haven't returned either.

394
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,120
I've already sent someone

395
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,850
to the tea plantation for news.

396
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,880
Perhaps she's been delayed by something.

397
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,920
Hurry to the entrance and wait for her.

398
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,400
Yes.

399
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,790
Make way, please.

400
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,510
My Lady,

401
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,320
I was afraid the market is too crowded.

402
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,220
In case some careless person

403
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,020
bumps into you

404
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,630
and ruins your enjoyment,

405
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,630
I took the liberty

406
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,220
of asking the driver to take this route.

407
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,130
If you don't like it,

408
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,580
we can reach the end of this road

409
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,310
and still go to the East Market.

410
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,190
Come.

411
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,500
Wait.

412
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,770
Who said I want to go back?

413
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,590
My Lady.

414
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Wait on the shore.

415
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:53,980
I...

416
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,650
Please.

417
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,180
What should we do?

418
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,600
He's always surrounded by people.

419
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,330
We can't find the right moment.

420
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,500
Let's go report back
to His Lordship.

421
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,490
What made you think of
taking a night cruise?

422
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,280
You've always been busy and hardworking.

423
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,290
Sometimes you should sit by the lake

424
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,420
to relieve your troubles and worries.

425
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,030
I've never had

426
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,690
such a peaceful state of mind.

427
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,470
Nor have I ever had the leisure

428
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,600
to sit aimlessly on a boat.

429
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,750
Just now as I stood here,

430
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,790
I was thinking about

431
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,350
how to put that filthy creature

432
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,950
in a sack with a large stone

433
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,960
and sink him right here in the lake.

434
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,840
So you want to rid the people of evil?

435
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,610
Would you like me to be a helper?

436
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,730
If I were to kill someone,

437
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,600
would you bury the body?

438
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,590
Yes.

439
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,360
It's kind of you to repay kindness,

440
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,880
but I'm not

441
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,610
a bandit who robs and plunders.

442
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,140
What bodies would I need you to bury?

443
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,920
I'm so worried

444
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,420
precisely because you're not.

445
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,680
There are

446
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,070
men in this world

447
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,530
with sinister intentions

448
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,410
who will pursue you by any means.

449
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,240
If you're tough in speech but soft-hearted

450
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,100
and show mercy,

451
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,440
I'm afraid you'll suffer greatly.

452
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,920
For example, the one staying in your room.

453
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,960
Lady Shanbao,
are you really going to marry him?

454
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,200
Why do you ask?

455
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,100
Don't you know?

456
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,700
And if I did know, what then?

457
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,240
Does

458
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,160
this outsider of

459
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,020
unknown origin

460
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,040
not deserve the Rong household?

461
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,910
I never meant that.

462
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,480
Although I don't remember

463
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
where I come from,

464
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,430
I've sneaked in your family's library

465
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,290
which is famous

466
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,430
throughout Jiangnan.

467
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,520
Classics, history, military,
agriculture, divination...

468
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,320
I've read 9,000 of the 10,000 volumes.

469
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,750
It seems I must have

470
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,350
studied diligently in my past.

471
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,480
Perhaps I even held an official title.

472
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,310
Just now, as our boat passed,

473
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,650
I easily identified errors
in the flute playing,

474
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,450
showing I'm versed in music too.

475
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,440
Many have come to the Rong Mansion
seeking marriage,

476
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,630
but where can you find another

477
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,250
who excels in flute, chess,
calligraphy, and painting,

478
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,350
skilled in both civil and martial arts,

479
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,720
willing to share your burdens

480
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,380
and even give his life for you?

481
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,090
By rights,

482
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,030
I should leave the Rong family immediately

483
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,830
and return to propose
after finding my identity.

484
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,590
But I fear...

485
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,370
I fear when I return,

486
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,630
you'll already belong to someone else.

487
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,770
Lu Fusheng.

488
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
I'm well-read and good at business.

489
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,240
I can even grasp well

490
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,440
the ways of the world and human hearts,

491
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,400
but the one thing I can't figure out

492
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,240
is your heart.

493
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,720
Why are you kind one moment,
distant the next,

494
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,550
sometimes changing your attitude?

495
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,270
It's so unpredictable.

496
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,020
But since I've set my heart on you

497
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,510
and made up my mind,

498
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,040
whether it leads to success or failure,

499
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,790
even if I end up

500
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,640
utterly defeated

501
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,700
and empty-handed,

502
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,300

Once you provoke your wife's disgust,

521
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,980
you'll be mercilessly expelled
from the Rong family.

522
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,380

Being my husband

529
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,480

Lady Shanbao told you
to look after Lady Yunwan.

578
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
That's your duty.

579
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:04,840
Go now.

580
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:07,840
I...

581
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,280
I...

582
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,870
Lady Shanbao,

583
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,240
why are you here?

584
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,150
I suddenly remembered
you painting on the boat earlier,

585
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,350
evasively hiding it,

586
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,690
unwilling to let me see.

587
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,880
You must have a secret.

588
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,810
I had to come and ask.

589
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,870
My feelings

590
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,230
have already been honestly
shared with you.

591
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,090
There's nothing I can't tell you.

592
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,320
If you want to see it,

593
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,460
here it is.

594
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,660
What do you

595
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,430
keep my portrait for?

596
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,020
There are already plenty

597
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,760
offering poems and paintings around you.

598
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,420
My attention hardly matters.

599
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,910
I keep it for company

600
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,900
on this lonely moonlit night.

601
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,440
You...

602
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,240
Lady Shanbao.

603
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:58,910
Wait,

604
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,170
I...

605
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,280
Tonight,

606
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,490
what... what are you...

607
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,040
On this lonely moonlit night,
a portrait has no feelings.

608
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,330
Even if you burn
three incense sticks daily

609
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,930
and pray devoutly every day,

610
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,500
a paper figure will never come to life.

611
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,520
I've come to keep you company tonight

612
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,640
and comfort your lonely heart.

613
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:50,830
What do you say?

614
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,750
I dare not accept your kindness.

615
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:28,950
Why?

616
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,250
Were all your words on the boat

617
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,240
just lies?

618
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,810
All those words
I spoke on the boat tonight

619
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,400
came from the bottom of my heart.

620
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,830
But with no matchmaker
and no marriage pledge

621
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,960
settled between us,

622
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,890
I dare not overstep even slightly

623
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,890
to offend you.

624
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,790
As long as both of us are willing,

625
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,860
what's wrong with overstepping?

626
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,440
After all, matchmakers can be changed,

627
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,880
engagements can be broken,

628
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,080
couples can divorce,

629
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,910
and lovers can grow apart.

630
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Nothing remains constant forever.

631
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,080
As long as we love each other

632
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,890
and our hearts are connected,

633
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,290
let the bright moon above be our witness,

634
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,020
the magnolia tree at the door
our matchmaker,

635
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,200
the passing spring breeze our officiant,

636
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,330
and the frost on the ground our guests.

637
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,950
What's wrong with becoming

638
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,680
husband and wife tonight?

639
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,580
But...

640
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,690
I don't even know where I come from.

641
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,440
Aren't you afraid?

642
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,690
What if I'm a desperate outlaw?

643
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,920
What if I've killed officials?

644
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,860
What if I have enemies everywhere?

645
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,460
What if...

646
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,690
What if I'm not a good person?

647
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,630
I've chosen the person before me,

648
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,170
at this moment,

649
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,270
in this place.

650
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,160
As for what you did before

651
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,990
or where you came from,

652
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:23,720
I don't care.

653
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,180
As long as you never deceive,

654
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,110
cheat,

655
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,060
or hide things from me,

656
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,490
that's enough.

657
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:38,880
Then...

658
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,820
when you speak of
becoming husband and wife,

659
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,820
do you mean just with me,

660
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,280
or with that Yang fellow as well?

661
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,070
Even the sight of him

662
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:50,800
disgusts me.

663
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,690
How could I ever marry him?

664
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,030
Then if you become

665
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,430
husband and wife with me,

666
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,500
is it for one night,

667
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:00,960
one month,

668
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
or a lifetime?

669
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:05,870
Well...

[Milk Tea]

671
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,430
You've always been busy and hardworking.

672
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,430
You should occasionally sit by the lake

673
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,490
to relieve your worries and sorrows.

[Invented in ancient times, the milk tea
isn't just a modern dating essential.]

675
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,400
According to
"The Family History of Marquis Ye",

676
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,630
the milk tea in the Tang Dynasty

677
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,000
contained milk curds
and was sprinkled with Sichuan pepper,

678
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,200
with a salty and spicy kick.

679
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,340

of milk curds mixed with tea foam.

683
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,050
Later, northwestern herdsmen

684
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,070
used brick tea with cow or sheep milk,

685
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,110
adding salt or butter

686
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,760
to make salty milk tea,

687
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,400
cutting greasiness and warding off cold.

688
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,670

in high-altitude cold regions,

690
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,110
and could be considered

691
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,920
the earliest dietary fiber supplement.

692
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,630
Later, when tea was introduced to Europe,

693
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,000
the British added milk and sugar,

694
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,510
