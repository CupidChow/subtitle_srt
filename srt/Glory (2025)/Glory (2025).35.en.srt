00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,789
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,930
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,970
Yunshu is managing things quite well.

4
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,150
He's not back yet?

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,070
Yes.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,140
Jun Dai just reported that

7
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,660
Mr. Lu was asked by Master Shuyu

8
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,720
to stay for dinner,

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,979
and you don't need to wait for him.

10
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,430
This Duke of Yongguo

11
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,090
is quite calculating indeed.

12
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,210
He's found a way

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,070
to control his son

14
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,310
so quickly.

15
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,070
My Lady, you mean...

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,970
First, luring with benefits,

17
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,830
then pressuring with authority.

18
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,150
When neither worked,

19
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,030
he appealed to emotions,

20
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,530
using me as a pawn to steady Jianglai,

21
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,630
and finally resorted to

22
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,890
fox-hunting tactics.

23
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,150
When the trap catches the young fox,

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,240
how can the mother fox

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,710
bear to escape alone?

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,490
If the mother doesn't work,

27
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,840
there's still the brother and nephew.

28
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,910
One of these baits will surely work.

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,840
Lu Jianglai,

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,540
you've been clever all your life,

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,260
yet you still fell for
the old hunter's trap.

32
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,030
Pack the luggage.

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,120
I'll set off back to Linji

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,920
early tomorrow morning.

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,120
My Lady.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,590
Cheers.

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,820
Let me toast you again.

38
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,230
I'm sorry for what I did.

39
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,140
That day when we talked,

40
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,680
I kept mentioning Madam Han.

41
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
I was just acting proud
of my legitimate son status,

42
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,240
trying to gain a bit of face
in front of you.

43
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,960
Legitimate son?

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
What kind of legitimate son am I?

45
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,800
What woman

46
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,430
could raise her husband's

47
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,230
son born by another woman

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,330
without any resentment

49
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,840
and treat him as her own?

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,750
True.

51
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,520
Clothing,

52
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,870
food,

53
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,560
shelter and travel—

54
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,030
she never mistreated me in any way.

55
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,850
She wouldn't allow anyone
to look down on me.

56
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,560
But my wet nurses

57
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,570
never stayed longer than six months.

58
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,270
Loyal servants didn't last long either.

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,260
She couldn't bear to see me cry

60
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,830
and even less
could she bear to see me smile.

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,390
Perhaps inside

62
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
she suffered more than I did.

63
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,070
As for Father,

64
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,930
before I was badly injured
from falling off a horse,

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,190
he had high hopes for me.

66
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
He said I was his proudest son

67
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,490
and the future hope of the Xue family.

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
But once this leg was broken,

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,870
everything changed.

70
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,560
Nobody cares about me anymore.

71
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,720
This leg aches to the bone

72
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,190
whenever it rains or the wind blows.

73
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,420
Mother should have

74
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,310
taken me with her back then.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
I'd have had my own mother

76
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,580
and brother.

77
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,200
I would have had a home.

78
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,360
Shuyu,

79
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,190
you do have a home.

80
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,910
As long as
you treat your wife well from now on

81
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,840
and raise your children with care,

82
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,050
sooner or later

83
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,690
you will earn their forgiveness.

84
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,170
Don't wait until it's too late

85
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,600
to regret what you've done.

86
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,450
Shuyu.

87
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,440
Shuyu.

88
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
Take good care of him.

89
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,980
Yes.

90
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
Master Jianglai, you're drunk.

91
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,070
Watch your step.

92
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,360
Let's go.

93
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,280
Princess Jinxiang heard
that Master Shuyu is ill

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,190
and ordered me to deliver

95
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,420
this calming medicinal soup,

96
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,530
insisting that Master Shuyu must take it.

97
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,860
Thanks for her concern.

98
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,070
Master Shuyu has already taken ginger soup

99
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,950
and is not seriously ill.

100
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,550
I'll report it
after he sobers up from the wine.

101
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,600
This medicinal soup

102
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
can be kept warm on the stove.

103
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,150
After parting today,

104
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,860
may your worries fade,

105
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,330
troubles stay far,

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,929
joy be constant,

107
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,460
fortune and longevity increase,

108
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,610
Buddha bless you for good health,

109
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,570
and a good match be found soon.

110
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,690
[To Mr. Lu]

111
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,570
What are you doing?

112
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,860
Let me see what you're hiding.

113
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,300
Bao,

114
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,770
what do you mean by this?

115
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,150
Legend has it

116
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,030
when Sima Xiangru parted from Zhuo Wenjun,

117
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,120
he wrote down

118
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,670
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

119
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,070
hundred, thousand, ten thousand and so on,

120
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,000
without "yi" (hundred million)
meaning without love.

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,960
I thought it over

122
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,750
and couldn't write a proper farewell note.

123
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,210
So I left the letter blank,

124
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,510
only returning

125
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,710
what you once gave me.

126
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,380
Isn't the intention clear enough?

127
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,380
-You...
-My Lord!

128
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,030
My lord!

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
Master Shuyu...

130
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,010
Master Shuyu...

131
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,740
is dead.

132
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,150
Jianglai!

133
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,270
Lady Shanbao,

134
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,630
the carriage is waiting outside.

135
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,030
Send someone
to deliver a message to Yunshu,

136
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,440
asking her to come immediately.

137
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,170
Just in case,

138
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,400
gather all the reliable people

139
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,660
we have in the capital.

140
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Lady Shanbao,

141
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,920
the boats at the dock are ready.

142
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,070
Old Madam is still in Linji,

143
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,960
eagerly awaiting

144
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,360
-your return.
-Go ahead.

145
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,670
Yes.

146
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,120
Your Highness, it was him.

147
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,240
Last night, Master Jianglai

148
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,910
was drinking and talking
with Master Shuyu.

149
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,550
I don't know what they discussed.

150
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,410
After Master Shuyu went to sleep,

151
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,500
Master Jianglai left.

152
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,260
The next morning,

153
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,040
Master Shuyu was still in bed.

154
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,960
I thought he hadn't
sobered up from the wine,

155
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,870
but when I tried to wake him,

156
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,970
his body was already stiff.

157
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,870
Your Highness,
if you want to interrogate someone,

158
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,800
please question Master Jianglai.

159
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,480
Jianglai,

160
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,480
what did you and Master Shuyu talk about?

161
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,080
How could he end up like this?

162
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,880
Last night...

163
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,320
Last night we talked about

164
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,720
our childhood memories.

165
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,280
Shuyu drank too much,

166
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,290
so I helped him lie down

167
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,000
told the servant
to take good care of him,

168
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,720
and then I left.

169
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,600
I don't know

170
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,130
what happened afterwards.

171
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,010
Why are you looking at me like that?

172
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,840
Even a vicious tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

173
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,100
No matter how much I despise him,

174
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,000
I would never

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,750
harm my own child.

176
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,720
Someone in this room

177
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,590
is lying!

178
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,510
Jun Dai!

179
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,240
Bring the coroner

180
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
that Lang Zhusheng brought!

181
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
I want an autopsy.

182
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,460
Outrageous!

183
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,630
Your father is still sitting right here.

184
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,080
How dare you give orders!

185
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,670
After your brother injured his leg,

186
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,240
his temperament changed drastically,

187
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,040
hiding in this room all day long.

188
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,080
His leg wound wouldn't heal,

189
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,170
and his anxiety became an illness
that no medicine could cure.

190
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,120
That's why he died suddenly
in the middle of the night.

191
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,270
The men of my Xue family

192
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,600
either die on the battlefield

193
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
or on their way to war.

194
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
None of them has ever

195
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,840
died so pathetically

196
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,040
and so ingloriously!

197
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,510
Now you want to call for an autopsy.

198
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,870
Do you want to spread this

199
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,720
for everyone to know,

200
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,480
telling the whole world

201
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,000
that I have

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,510
a useless, crippled son?

203
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,320
What if I insist on an autopsy?

204
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,240
How dare you!

205
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,240
Lady Rong Shanbao,

206
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,100
you can't go in.

207
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,630
Well,

208
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,270
my own son

209
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,710
is conspiring with outsiders

210
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,000
to rebel against me.

211
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,160
Rong Shanbao,

212
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,440
do you think the Duke's Mansion

213
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,270
is some place

214
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,030
where you can barge in as you please

215
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,230
with such impudence?

216
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,030
Go.

217
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,840
I forbid it!

218
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,950
Your Highness, may we examine him now?

219
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,510
Go ahead.

220
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,750
Your Highness, Lord Lu,

221
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,240
I have examined the body.

222
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,320
Apart from eight whip marks on the back,

223
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,520
there are no injuries

224
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,830
on any other part of the body or the head.

225
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,190
A silver needle
inserted into the deceased's throat

226
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,550
came out bright and clean,

227
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,810
so the deceased did not die of poisoning.

228
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,870
Not poison, not physical assault.

229
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,910
Then how exactly...

230
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,270
How did he actually die?

231
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,500
Your Highness,

232
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
based on my examination

233
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,200
of the body's condition,

234
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,720
Master Shuyu died suddenly

235
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,910
from an acute illness during the night.

236
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,040
It wasn't foul play?

237
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,320
No.

238
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,840
Lady Shanbao,

239
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,030
the room, floor, and windows

240
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,070
have all been examined.

241
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,960
No signs of struggle

242
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,490
or forced entry were found.

243
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,650
Your Highness,

244
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,600
Master Shuyu retired at 9 p.m. last night.

245
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,840
As he was usually a light sleeper,

246
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,320
servants were forbidden
to move about or cough,

247
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,750
fearing they might disturb his rest.

248
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,320
The wine and food inside
were left untouched,

249
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,240
and these two kept watch
at the door all night,

250
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,840
seeing no one enter or leave.

251
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,480
The concubines were not summoned

252
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,020
and remained in their own chambers.

253
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,150
This morning at 7 a.m.,

254
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,080
Miss Ji Ping entered with her maid.

255
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,960
Shortly after,

256
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,650
crying and wailing were heard from inside.

257
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,410
Master Shuyu was truly heartless,

258
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,390
leaving me and our two children behind,

259
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,990
passing away just like that,

260
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,960
without even a final farewell.

261
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,410
No wonder you called for a coroner.

262
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,400
So it was sudden illness.

263
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,790
In that case,

264
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,980
your suspicion of murder

265
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,880
is completely cleared.

266
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,329
Princess Jinxiang, mind your words.

267
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,200
Fratricide is punishable
by death by a thousand cuts.

268
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,550
Don't make baseless accusations

269
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,000
against innocent people.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,880
Innocent?

271
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,069
Innocent,

272
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,640
your own brother

273
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,850
offered you the Duke's heir position,

274
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,200
while you pretended

275
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,350
to refuse it with false modesty,

276
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,640
acting as if titles and wealth

277
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,840
meant nothing to you.

278
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,510
Who'd have thought you were secretly

279
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,440
plotting to kill your own brother?

280
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,640
This way,

281
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,480
the title rightfully

282
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,740
falls into your hands,

283
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,590
and you even gain

284
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,720
a reputation for brotherly devotion.

285
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,750
Lu,

286
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,920
you're truly calculating

287
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,830
and vicious.

288
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,490
You're talking nonsense.

289
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,200
Father,

290
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,550
last night in the room,

291
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,270
there were only the two brothers.

292
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,440
What happened

293
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,790
is entirely up to him to lie about.

294
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,200
Besides, he once served as

295
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,920
an official in charge of criminal cases

296
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,960
and has handled

297
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,490
countless ruthless cases.

298
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,280
Who knows how many
methods of murder are there

299
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,350
that a coroner can't detect?

300
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,070
My poor brother

301
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,180
was weak in character, pure and kind,

302
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,000
yet he treated a vicious wolf

303
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,640
as his own brother.

304
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,110
Father,

305
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,280
no matter how flawed Shuyu was,

306
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
he was still your own son.

307
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,480
You must not bestow the title

308
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,350
upon some

309
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,070
malicious outsider.

310
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,070
Nonsense.

311
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,030
These are all your baseless speculations.

312
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,920
The coroner already stated

313
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,270
that your brother died of sudden illness.

314
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,000
So many people were watching him.

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,530
They couldn't all be lying.

316
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,690
Don't speak such nonsense again.

317
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,510
Ruiniang,

318
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,680
who told you to bring the children here?

319
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,410
Young Madam,

320
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,080
didn't you order to bring

321
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,510
Master Peixun and Lady Xuanyu

322
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,070
here?

323
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,400
I gave the order.

324
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,030
Come.

325
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,270
Father,

326
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,550
look at your grandson.

327
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,290
He's only seven years old.

328
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,720
And there's Xuanyu.

329
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,260
She's also so innocent

330
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,200
and naive.

331
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
This poor pair of children

332
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,920
rely entirely on your protection.

333
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
Please forgive my bluntness.

334
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,480
After all, in this world,

335
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,880
no one lives forever.

336
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,350
One day, after you're gone,

337
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,460
whom can these innocent

338
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,790
young ones rely on?

339
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,720
In another year or two,

340
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,880
when our Xun

341
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
understands reason and propriety,

342
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,040
if he asks you, Grandfather,

343
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,350
why you gave the title to someone

344
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,350
who might have killed

345
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,920
their own father,

346
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,830
Father, how will you

347
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,870
explain it to the children then?

348
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,960
Princess Jinxiang,
you spoke with hidden barbs,

349
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
so aggressively,

350
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,110
and kept mentioning titles and wealth.

351
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,840
Don't worry.

352
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,830
I don't care about the Duke's title,

353
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,060
nor do I want your Xue family's fortune.

354
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,010
Come here. Come to Mother.

355
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,930
Proving your innocence isn't hard.

356
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,080
As long as Lu Jianglai

357
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,200
gives up wealth and power,

358
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,310
writes a letter severing family ties,

359
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,520
leaves the Duke of Yongguo's Mansion
from now on,

360
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,480
and has no connection whatsoever,
in life, death, poverty, or wealth.,

361
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,830
and even if you meet

362
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Xun on the street in the future,

363
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,270
don't have the nerve

364
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,970
to call yourself his uncle,

365
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,650
then I'll believe that you're

366
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,590
not greedy for power or wealth,

367
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,410
that you're an innocent good person.

368
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,820
Don't rush.

369
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,400
Her words may seem absurd,

370
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,640
but she's actually setting traps,
pressing you step by step.

371
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,790
She intends to frame you
for killing your brother.

372
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,590
If you refuse,

373
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,790
she'll say you plotted for the title
and killed him.

374
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,550
If you agree,

375
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,240
people will be even more suspicious

376
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,360
that you're the real murderer,

377
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,220
driven out of the Duke's Mansion.

378
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,080
Whether you agree or not,

379
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,070
whether you inherit the title or not,

380
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,160
you'll face criticism either way.

381
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,200
They'll call you

382
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,390
a villain who plotted
your brother's death.

383
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,900
What a vicious scheme.

384
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,720
Unless the truth about Shuyu's death

385
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,580
comes to light,

386
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,110
I absolutely will not

387
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,470
leave the Xue family now.

388
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,330
Your Highness,

389
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,410
Shuyu never sent anyone to kill me.

390
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,640
The assassination attempt the other night

391
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,100
was someone else's doing.

392
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,240
This person deliberately

393
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
creates discord and hatred

394
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,270
between us brothers,

395
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,350
provoking us to kill each other

396
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,610
for their own benefit.

397
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,870
I must expose this person.

398
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,400
Fine. Then tell me,

399
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,540
who would dare do such a thing?

400
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,240
Were

401
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,270
the food and wine Master Shuyu consumed

402
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,530
last night all tested?

403
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,930
They were all checked.

404
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,200
No poison or incompatible foods
were found.

405
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,670
What about that bowl of ginger soup?

406
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,470
Ginger soup?

407
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,960
Well...

408
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,400
Earlier, when checking
and inventorying items,

409
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
no ginger soup was found.

410
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,350
Wasn't it said that no one

411
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,010
entered Master Shuyu's room?

412
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,030
Then how did the leftover ginger soup

413
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,000
simply vanish into thin air?

414
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,830
Ji Ping,

415
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,610
did you deliver that bowl of ginger soup?

416
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,720
Yes,

417
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,880
that bowl of ginger soup

418
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,350
was indeed delivered by me.

419
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,640
But whether he drank it or not,

420
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
how much he drank,

421
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,070
and who took away the bowl—

422
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,530
I have absolutely no idea.

423
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,640
Last night,

424
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,750
Master Shuyu was incited by someone else

425
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,400
and drove me out

426
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,660
without explanation.

427
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,310
I didn't understand then,

428
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,160
but thinking about it carefully now,

429
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
if someone deliberately
meant to harm Master Shuyu,

430
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,880
they'd certainly

431
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,270
want me out of the way.

432
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,290
You're like a thief crying "Stop thief!"

433
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,490
Xue Sangui,

434
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,880
go search her room.

435
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,780
Yes, sir.

436
00:22:59,210 --> 00:22:59,740
Let's go.

437
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,550
You, with the coal braziers,

438
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,670
come here.

439
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,920
I've said before

440
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,550
that you are not

441
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,810
a sentimental person.

442
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,400
You'd overcome all obstacles to succeed.

443
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Vulnerability and melancholy
are rarely seen in you.

444
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,550
Indeed.

445
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,240
The same tradition
applies to the Rong family.

446
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,900
As long as I'm not by your side,

447
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,680
someone will immediately

448
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,510
take my place!

449
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,530
Will it be Cheng Guanyu

450
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,940
or your cousin Wen Can?

451
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,920
Could there be something wrong
with this brazier?

452
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,190
Master Shuyu was frail
and feared the cold.

453
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,640
Every year at this time,

454
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,680
two braziers are added to his room,

455
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,030
burning the finest silver-frost charcoal.

456
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,490
Is there something wrong
with the charcoal?

457
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,440
Lady Shanbao, Lady Yunshu has arrived.

458
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,510
Perfect. Invite her in.

459
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,270
Yes.

460
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,120
Our Xue family
is discussing private matters.

461
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,480
We don't need the Rong family interfering.

462
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,920
Princess Jinxiang, please remain calm.

463
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,720
The person I've invited isn't an outsider,

464
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,520
but a witness.

465
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,280
How can she testify?

466
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,060
Your Highness,

467
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,550
my sister Yunshu

468
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,070
had eye trouble as a child,

469
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,510
which led her to develop

470
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,510
a sense of smell keener than a fox's.

471
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,920
I identify tea mostly
with my eyes and hands,

472
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,780
but she relies solely on her nose.

473
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,510
Yunshu, would you please smell

474
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,600
if there's something
unusual in this brazier?

475
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,130
This silver-frost charcoal
is also known as white charcoal.

476
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,680
Its enduring properties

477
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,550
conform to

478
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,200
the alchemist's pursuit of immortality,

479
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
which is why it's often used

480
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,130
to make elixirs.

481
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,200
When Grandmother was ill,

482
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,680
doctors would use white charcoal

483
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,830
to line the bottom of the brazier,

484
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,830
place an iron mesh above
to steam medicinal pills,

485
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,360
enhancing their efficacy.

486
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,170
I remember.

487
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,880
Yunshu,

488
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,160
has anything been added to this charcoal?

489
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,130
It's Valley Lily mixed with honey,

490
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,060
made into pills.

491
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,830
Valley Lily?

492
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,130
What effect does it have?

493
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,240
Valley Lily,
also called Convallariae Majalis.

494
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,040
It can promote blood circulation
and dispel wind.

495
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,720
When the charcoal burns,
the lily's fragrance emerges.

496
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,130
Since its subtle scent is hidden,

497
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,400
often masked by charcoal smoke

498
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,750
and room incense,

499
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,620
it's not easily detected.

500
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,960
Over time,

501
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,920
the occupant becomes prone to illness.

502
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,030
Minor symptoms include irritability,

503
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,430
palpitations, anxiety,

504
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,450
and uncontrollable mood swings.

505
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,580
In severe cases,

506
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,070
it can lead to heart failure and death.

507
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,400
Your Highness,

508
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,680
this packet of pills has a faint scent,

509
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
each the size of a mung bean.

510
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
They were found

511
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,270
in Miss Ji Ping's room.

512
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:05,890
I don't-

513
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,600
Seize her!

514
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,690
Spit it out!

515
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,540
It's Valley Lily scented pills.

516
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,240
Thank you. You may go rest now.

517
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,910
I'll wait for you in the library.

518
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,400
Ji Ping,

519
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,290
Master Shuyu loved you so much.

520
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,720
Why would you harm him?

521
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,490
Release her. Let her speak.

522
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,480
Easy for you to say, Mrs. Xue.

523
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,830
You're the principal wife

524
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,440
and the legitimate consort.

525
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,170
And what am I?

526
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,880
I'm just a concubine,

527
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,550
and a lowly woman

528
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,810
from the opera troupe.

529
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,070
When others say
Master Shuyu loves his concubine,

530
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,130
envy beyond words.

531
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,590
But who knows

532
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,240
how dark and suffocating this mansion is,

533
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,040
not seeing my parents for years.

534
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,680
Forget going to the peddler
at the back gate

535
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,740
to buy a flower or some makeup to wear—

536
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,270
I haven't even

537
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,800
stepped outside this door.

538
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,910
When Master Shuyu was happy,

539
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,710
he'd grant me a smile.

540
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,790
When he returned
after being scolded by the Duke,

541
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,990
my body would be bruised for two months.

542
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,510
In my next life,

543
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,680
I'd rather be a pig or dog
than a concubine.

544
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,640
Yes, I am a lowly person,

545
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,260
but however humble, I am still human.

546
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,450
He never treated me as a person,

547
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,580
so don't blame me for taking his life.

548
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,030
Who doesn't live

549
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,560
like this in a deep mansion?

550
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,690
Since ancient times,
those who kill must pay with their lives.

551
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,490
And you killed your own husband.

552
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,060
There's no way out for you.

553
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,750
Mrs. Xue, there's no need for you

554
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,080
to waste your kindness.

555
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,240
I'd

556
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,570
rather be dragged to the execution ground

557
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,510
than be suffocated

558
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,750
to death

559
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,750
under this mountain.

560
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,430
[Fuping Pavilion]

561
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,540
You wretch!

562
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,510
Plotting against your husband
is against heaven's law.

563
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,240
You deserve to be flayed alive.

564
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,240
I only fear if this becomes public,

565
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,370
it will ruin our family's reputation,

566
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,720
letting outsiders gossip and stir trouble,

567
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,920
tarnishing Father's lifelong good name.

568
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,240
In my humble opinion,

569
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,880
this vile woman

570
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,620
shouldn't be openly
sent to the government.

571
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,000
Better to handle this privately.

572
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,860
Grant her a white silk rope

573
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,060
to end her own life.

574
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,070
Take her away now!

575
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:53,880
Wait!

576
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,800
Jianglai,

577
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,480
you wanted to catch the murderer,

578
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,960
and I didn't go against your wishes.

579
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,620
Now we've caught the culprit.

580
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,920
Your brother can finally rest in peace.

581
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,960
What more do you want?

582
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,090
I haven't finished my interrogation!

583
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,550
I drank too much last night,

584
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,020
faintly hearing Princess Jinxiang

585
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,680
sending over a calming tonic.

586
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,220
I wonder if Master Shuyu ever took it.

587
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,980
Master Shuyu woke up
in the middle of the night,

588
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,400
complaining of a headache.

589
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,180
In the past when Master Shuyu was drunk,

590
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,790
Princess often showed her concern

591
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,390
by sending sobering tonics,

592
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,930
and Master Shuyu
praised its effectiveness.

593
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,510
I just want to know

594
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,120
if he actually took it last night!

595
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,440
The calming tonic
was kept in the corridor,

596
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,790
warming on the charcoal stove.

597
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,880
I poured half a cup.

598
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,790
Master Shuyu drank it
and went back to sleep.

599
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,250
The rest is in the tea room.

600
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,680
Lu Jianglai,

601
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,550
we've already caught

602
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,630
the real murderer.

603
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,480
Why are you still
asking all these questions?

604
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,240
Could it be that you suspect

605
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,830
I killed my own brother?

606
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,160
Even without Master Shuyu,

607
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,270
this title

608
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,220
couldn't possibly fall to me anyway.

609
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,790
Are there any Valley Lily
in the mansion garden?

610
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,960
Or has anyone grown them
in their courtyard?

611
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,790
The garden only
has exotic flowers and plants.

612
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,650
No one has ever grown Valley Lily.

613
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,640
That's strange then.

614
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,660
A sheltered woman from the opera troupe,

615
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,720
with little experience of the world,

616
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,960
who has never even stepped
beyond the courtyard gate—

617
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,170
who told her that Valley Lily is poisonous

618
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,370
and how to kill without leaving a trace?

619
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,960
And where did she obtain

620
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,690
the Valley Lily scented pills?

621
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,880
Ji Ping, who are you conspiring with?

622
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,680
If you don't
name the mastermind behind this,

623
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,940
the water dungeon in the Duke's Mansion
will show no mercy.

624
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,640
Take her away and torture her severely!

625
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,400
No! I'm not going to the water dungeon!

626
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm not going to the water dungeon!

627
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,350
Then tell me!

628
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,200
Please, Your Highness,

629
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,460
grant me a quick death.

630
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,070
Let me die. Let me die!

631
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm not going to the water dungeon!

632
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm not going to the water dungeon!

633
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,290
I don't want to go to the water dungeon!

634
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,890
Your Highness, if you use severe torture,

635
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,820
she might make false confessions.

636
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,200
We must also prevent her
from implicating the innocent

637
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,460
and wronging the good.

638
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,810
Ultimately, the result might fall short.

639
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,880
No.

640
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,800
Jianglai.

641
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,420
Jun Dai.

642
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,510
Yes.

643
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,000
Go to the tea room

644
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,800
and bring the calming tonic.

645
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,590
Test it, and we'll know.

646
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:15,750
Yes.

647
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,720
You suspect

648
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,390
I conspired with a concubine?

649
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,790
Fine, test it then.

650
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,950
I've done nothing wrong,

651
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,650
so there's nothing to fear.

652
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,610
Young Madam.

653
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,270
Mother!

654
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:32,920
What's wrong, Mother?

655
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,590
What's wrong with you?

656
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,350
Mother!

657
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,640
Wake up!

658
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,790
Wake up!

659
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,720
Mother, wake up!

660
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,550
Mother!

661
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,600
Has the culprit been caught?

662
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,320
His Highness has ordered

663
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,010
Ji Ping to be detained for now.

664
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,310
What about the mastermind behind this?

665
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,070
Miss Ji Ping

666
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,790
grew up with the opera troupe,

667
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,270
traveling streets and alleys.

668
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,590
She's seen many shady secrets

669
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,750
in noble households.

670
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,350
It's no surprise
she knew Valley Lily is poisonous.

671
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,380
Regardless of
where the Valley Lily came from,

672
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,310
we'll question everyone
in Fuping Pavilion,

673
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,770
and the truth will
eventually come to light.

674
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,750
I doubt that.

675
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,250
Why do you say so?

676
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,480
The Xue family has many secrets.

677
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,640
That day when I entered the garden,

678
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,590
I happened to see Lady Xue Xuanyu

679
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,750
playing with someone.

680
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,680
Guess who it was?

681
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,630
It was that aggressive woman

682
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,350
who strongly accused
Lord Lu of being the murderer,

683
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,480
Princess Jinxiang.

684
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,270
Xue Yingchuan?

685
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,240
She's the children's aunt.

686
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,110
What's wrong with her playing with Xuanyu?

687
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,830
That's exactly what's strange.

688
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,430
When she saw a stranger then,

689
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,780
she immediately avoided being seen.

690
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
Given how sharp-tongued and cutting

691
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,280
she was today,

692
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,000
how could she be

693
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,060
someone who's shy and avoids people?

694
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,650
Just now, I recognized her

695
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,840
and had my maid

696
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,800
get information
from the Xue family's servants.

697
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,480
Guess what?

698
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,550
What secret

699
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
did you uncover?

700
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,880
The Xue family's maid said

701
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,030
this Princess Jinxiang

702
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,920
despises noisy children the most.

703
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,850
Even her own niece is no exception.

704
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,150
She usually avoids them,
keeping her distance,

705
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,150
and is quite cold.

706
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,920
Something unusual
must have a hidden cause.

707
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,960
Either her standing up
for her nephew and niece

708
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,219
has ulterior motives,

709
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,810
or she's hiding something

710
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,790
unspeakable.

711
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
That makes sense.

712
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,610
What about the person
I asked you to investigate?

713
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,580
You guessed correctly.

714
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,580
She's indeed acting suspiciously.

715
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,030
This is the calming tonic

716
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,650
that Princess Jinxiang sent last night.

717
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,110
After Master Shuyu drank a cup,

718
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,670
there wasn't much left in the pot.

719
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,920
I tested it on a rat.

720
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,720
After taking this tonic,

721
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,880
the rat was still alive and kicking

722
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,940
half an hour later.

723
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,010
If it had no effect on a small rat,

724
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,140
let alone on a human.

725
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,030
It's clear that no poison

726
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,480
was added to this tonic.

727
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,940
I'm not so sure about that.

728
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,110
There are many ways

729
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,710
to harm people in this world.

730
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,650
My Lord, I've found the person you wanted.

731
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,590
Greetings, My Lord.

732
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,280
It took great effort to bring him here.

733
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,360
The Tao family has
practiced medicine for five generations,

734
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,840
with ancestors
who served as imperial physicians.

735
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,320
When it comes to
expertise in pharmacology,

736
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,760
if Dr. Tao claims to be second best,

737
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,510
no one in the capital

738
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,070
would dare claim to be first.

739
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,510
Dr. Tao, I entrust everything to you.

740
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,230
My Lord, I'm flattered.

741
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,070
On the way here,

742
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,760
Mr. Lang

743
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,630
has already explained
everything clearly to me.

744
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,190
I will do my utmost

745
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
and dare not fail.

746
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,890
[Fuping Pavilion]

747
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,590
Your Highness,

748
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,110
I have examined it.

749
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,030
Speak.

750
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,920
This calming tonic contains ginseng,

751
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,840
lotus seeds, ophiopogon,

752
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
poria, and angelica,

753
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,930
which nourish the heart
and relieve irritability.

754
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,140
Due to Master Shuyu's leg injury,

755
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,670
tortoise shell and tiger tibia bone
were added

756
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,070
to strengthen his bones,

757
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,000
which is truly beneficial.

758
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,320
Father,

759
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,710
you heard it yourself.

760
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,880
This calming tonic contains

761
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,210
only beneficial herbs.

762
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,670
I was nearly wrongfully accused

763
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,690
by this malicious person.

764
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,230
Jianglai,

765
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,800
your sister-in-law
is overwhelmed with grief.

766
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,760
Despite her illness,

767
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,360
she insists on hearing your judgment,

768
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,400
just to seek justice

769
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
for your brother.

770
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,790
Is this your solid evidence?

771
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,960
Dr. Tao hasn't finished speaking.

772
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,230
Why are you so impatient?

773
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,400
Fine, continue.

774
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,840
In the residue of the calming tonic,

775
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,360
there's also cinnamon, aconite,

776
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,450
and monkshood.

777
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,760
These are used to treat rheumatic pain

778
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,840
and relieve pain.

779
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,110
What about cinnamon and aconite?

780
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,370
Ginseng, poria, and angelica

781
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,200
are indeed excellent herbs

782
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,480
for strengthening the body and blood.

783
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,400
But with aconite and monkshood added

784
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,480
to dispel evil and wind,

785
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,110
it has

786
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,710
the effect of Great Reviving Pill.

787
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
I questioned his personal servant.

788
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,400
Due to Master Shuyu's back and leg pain,

789
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,320
when encountering
rainy or changing weather,

790
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,280
he often had stiff limbs at night,

791
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,000
difficulty bending and stretching,

792
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,320
and the joints of his sick leg
were deformed.

793
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,580
Dr. Liu from the palace

794
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,070
left a good prescription.

795
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,630
I've seen the prescription.

796
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,360
It's the Gastrodia Pill

797
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,330
for relieving pain
and benefiting the liver.

798
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,030
Taking one dose daily of Gastrodia Pill

799
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,280
is appropriate treatment.

800
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,440
The Great Reviving Pill

801
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,760
also won't kill anyone on its own.

802
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
But taking the two together is different.

803
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,960
Especially aconite,
which is hot-natured and toxic.

804
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,000
Once overdosed,

805
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,960
even beneficial medicine

806
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,420
can become deadly poison.

807
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,000
You knew Master Shuyu

808
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,230
was taking the Gastrodia Pill

809
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,630
and should have avoided
any contraindications,

810
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,510
yet you deliberately
sent this calming tonic

811
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,970
with hidden intricacies.

812
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,380
What were your intentions?

813
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,970
You're slandering me!

814
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,150
Even Dr. Liu couldn't see any problem.

815
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,960
How would I know

816
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,760
if they could be taken together?

817
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,290
Besides, this is just your speculation.

818
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,760
Whether taking both could kill someone

819
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,710
is still uncertain.

820
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,550
Very well.
If you're so certain it's harmless,

821
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,880
why not try it yourself?

822
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,400
Take the Gastrodia Pill

823
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,800
and the Great Reviving Pill

824
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,460
together in increased doses.

825
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,020
If you remain perfectly safe,

826
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,590
I'll leave the Duke's Mansion immediately

827
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,880
and never return.

828
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,110
Yingchuan,

829
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,700
what do you have to say?

830
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,550
Why won't you take it?

831
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,440
This is your perfect opportunity

832
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,840
to prove your innocence.

833
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,360
Father,

834
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
since Mother has been ill
and depressed for a long time,

835
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,790
unable to sleep at night,

836
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,630
I specially invited an imperial physician

837
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,400
to prescribe calming tonic for her,

838
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,930
and it worked wonderfully.

839
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,360
I was simply sharing the benefit,

840
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,860
concerned about Shuyu's health,

841
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,630
with absolutely no ill intentions.

842
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
As a daughter,

843
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,590
I can neither uphold the household

844
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,070
nor inherit any titles.

845
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,190
Shuyu and I grew up together

846
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,600
with deep affection.

847
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,960
How could I possibly intend to harm him,

848
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,680
only to let an outsider gain advantage?

849
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,110
The saying that I would harm my brother

850
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,440
makes no sense emotionally or logically.

851
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,490
Your Highness,

852
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,000
Mother has long suffered from diabetes,

853
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,360
often complaining of
numbness in her limbs,

854
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,710
and has difficulty walking.

855
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,070
I went back to beg my grandfather

856
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,840
to prepare a prescription for her.

857
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,670
He said it's the best for
treating numbness in the limbs.

858
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,150
The Xie family's medical skills
are passed only to sons, not daughters.

859
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,070
I don't understand pharmacology.

860
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,150
Mother said she felt better
after taking it,

861
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,280
so she kept taking this prescription.

862
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,760
It's all my fault.

863
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,230
I should have been more cautious,

864
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,190
understood
the contraindications of the medicine,

865
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,920
so this later misfortune

866
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,320
wouldn't have occurred.

867
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,070
Father,

868
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,280
I swear.

869
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,390
This medicine

870
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,670
indeed came from

871
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,960
Mother's quarters.

872
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,450
I truly didn't know.

873
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,060
I've been wronged.

874
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,800
I've been wronged!

875
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,670
You must believe me!

876
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,530
You may not know the inside story,

877
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,840
but others might have ill intentions.

878
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,360
Bring Madam Chang here.

879
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,510
Go!

880
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:41,590
Yes.

881
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,550
The Xie family's daughter
is graceful and magnanimous,

882
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,950
renowned for her virtue,

883
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,960
which is well-known in the capital.

884
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,400
I believe in you.

885
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,660
Help her up.

886
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,880
Although a major incident
has occurred in the mansion,

887
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,590
Madam's health is not well.

888
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,000
She's only had half a bowl
of rice congee in two days.

889
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,930
Her legs and feet

890
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,440
are too swollen for her to walk.

891
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,640
What matter must be inquired about now?

892
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,440
It's most inhumane.

893
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,610
Set down the sedan.

894
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,030
Gently, all of you.

895
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,880
-Madam.
-Madam.

896
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
You're still ill.

897
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,690
His Highness won't blame you.

898
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,670
-Just let them...
-Help me get off the sedan.

899
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,280
Madam.

900
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,880
Let go.

901
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,410
-Madam.
-Let go.

902
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,840
-Madam!
-Madam!

903
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,000
Let go.

904
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,630
What?

905
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,180
A joint interrogation

906
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,710
has come upon me?

907
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,290
Shuyu was not your biological son,

908
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,020
and you've always been distant with him.

909
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,930
But I thought
that coming from a noble family,

910
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,640
though not agreeable in temperament,

911
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,280
you would raise the children

912
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,000
and manage the household

913
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,660
with diligence and fairness.

914
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,640
I never expected

915
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,970
your poisonous intentions
were hidden here.

916
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,110
Knowing full well that Shuyu

917
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,040
was the heir of the Duke's Mansion,

918
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,410
you instigated Yingchuan to poison him.

919
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,070
How malevolent.

920
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,630
You've not only disgraced
the Xue family's honor,

921
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,880
but also brought shame upon

922
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,140
your own Chang family.

923
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,470
Even death by a thousand cuts
would be too merciful.

924
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,330
Your Highness,

925
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:22,590
Madam Chang used the medicine

926
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,970
only to treat her own illness.

927
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,060
You readily believe
Xue Yingchuan's inciting words

928
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,920
and lightly conclude her guilty.

929
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,700
Is the Great Reviving Pill

930
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,670
only available in Madam Chang's quarters?

931
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,800
Couldn't Xue Yingchuan get it elsewhere?

932
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,440
Madam Chang has no sons of her own

933
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,360
and no grudges.

934
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,020
Why would she scheme to harm Master Shuyu?

935
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,140
No grudges?

936
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,070
Of course she has grievances,

937
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,650
but they shouldn't be directed at Shuyu.

938
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,010
They should rightly be aimed at me.

939
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,700
Your Highness,

940
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,400
Mother has always been fair

941
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,510
and strict in managing the household.

942
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,360
She treats herself

943
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,480
more harshly than she treats juniors

944
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,320
and servants.

945
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,360
That's why this household is so orderly

946
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,670
with proper respect for hierarchy.

947
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:07,510
While you were at the front

948
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,510
fighting in the war,

949
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,510
Mother has been
managing everything at home.

950
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,710
I don't believe Mother

951
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,260
would ever plot to harm anyone.

952
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,720
Please investigate this matter carefully.

953
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,680
Mother wouldn't harm Master Shuyu,

954
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,880
but I would?

955
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,280
She has been neglected for years,

956
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,540
so it's natural she harbors resentment.

957
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,800
In a moment of poor judgment,

958
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,350
she made a terrible mistake.

959
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,140
Yet you keep defending her.

960
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,550
Are you trying to shift

961
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,920
the blame onto me?

962
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,720
Father, I've been wronged.

963
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,120
It was me.

964
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,920
I killed Xue Shuyu.

[Brewing Tea, Tasting Tea]

966
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,320
No matter where the Valley Lily came from,

967
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
we'll question
everyone in Fuping Pavilion.

968
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,580
The truth will eventually come to light.

969
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,700
I doubt it.

970
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,290
Why do you say so?

971
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,000
China has a vast variety of teas,

972
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,060
with various ways to appreciate them.

973
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,150
In our drama, the Rong family

974
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,010
mainly cultivates Longjing tea.

975
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,150
To drink Longjing properly,

976
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,030
you need the right method

977
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,030
to taste its fresh, vibrant flavor.

978
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,920
First, warm and moisten the cup.

979
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,900
[Warming the Cup]

980
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,280
Pinch some tea leaves
and place them at the bottom of the cup.

981
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,050
Let boiled water sit for three minutes,

982
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,900
allowing it reaches about 80 ℃.

983
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,770
Add a little water to the bottom,

984
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,540
just enough to cover the tea leaves.

985
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,870
Hold the cup and swirl it

986
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,350
counterclockwise twice.

987
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,790
This step is called
"moistening the tea to release aroma."

988
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,820
[Moistening Tea to Release Aroma]

989
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,360
Then using

990
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,920
the "Phoenix Nods Three Times" method,

991
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,920
pour water until the cup is 70% full.

992
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,230
Watch the tea leaves float and sink,

993
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,550
releasing the tea fragrance.

994
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,230
After waiting two to three minutes,

995
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,560
the tea soup will gradually turn

996
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,710
a bright yellowish-green color.

997
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:27,480
This is the perfect

998
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,070
temperature and taste for appreciation.

999
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,800
We can savor it in three stages.

1000
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,390
[First Sip, Second Sip, Third Sip]

1001
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,110
The first stage

1002
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,360
is to appreciate its rich, fresh aroma.

1003
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,590
When half the tea soup remains,

1004
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,650
refill with water.

1005
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,670
The second stage
reveals the tea's true flavor—

1006
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,110
fresh, mellow and full,

1007
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,150
leaving a lingering fragrance
with each sip.

1008
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,880
When the cup

1009
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,400
has one-third of tea soup left,

1010
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,230
refill with water.

1011
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,590
The third stage brings

1012
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,920
a mouth-watering sweet aftertaste.

1013
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,110
The aroma is subtle yet long-lasting.

1014
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,280
After finishing the last round,

1015
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,440
remember to pour out the tea leaves

1016
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,710
into a basin of clear water.

1017
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,230
You can admire how the spent leaves

1018
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,400
still bloom beautifully.
