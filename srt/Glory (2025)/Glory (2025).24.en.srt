00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,750
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,990
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,759
I'm a member of the Rong family.

4
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,680
I can't believe
you want me to be your spy.

5
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,410
Yang Yitang,

6
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,920
have you lost your mind?

7
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,160
Lady Yunshu,

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,039
you offered advice to me

9
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,000
and instructed me
to expose Madam Yang as an impostor.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,060
Have you been doing this for charity?

11
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
You're just
trying to incite Old Madam Rong

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,920
to detest Lady Shanbao

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,580
so that she will be driven out.

14
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,440
But even without Rong Shanbao,

15
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,740
the Rong family still won't be yours.

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Don't forget that

17
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,870
you still have

18
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,480
a shrewd sister, Yunxi.

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680
Though she's not as favored as you,

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,000
her reputation in the tea business

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
far exceeds yours.

22
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,360
Besides, will Old Madam Rong

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,090
really pass the Rong family's business
onto you?

24
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,080
That old fox

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,030
is just using you to suppress

26
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,490
Rong Shanbao's prestige.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,430
If you truly regard

28
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,680
Old Madam's flattery as genuine favor,

29
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,750
then you're really a fool.

30
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,710
We used to
have a mutually beneficial relationship.

31
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,840
If I help you now,

32
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,590
what benefits will I get?

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,630
I've heard that the vast wealth
accumulated by

34
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,190
several generations of the Rong family

35
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,280
is stored
in the Rong family's private treasury.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,960
With your share
of this substantial family property,

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,630
you can establish your own business.

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,630
Then you will no longer have to

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,560
stay by Old Madam's side

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
to serve her.

41
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,970
If I make my grandmother happy,

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
how would you know
I can't get the family property?

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,020
Why do I have to take such risks

44
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,470
and attract thieves from outside?

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,930
If you refuse to be my ally,

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,120
then you'll be considered as my enemy.

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
Unless you want Old Madam

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,310
to see through your ambitions.

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,430
So what even if she sees through

50
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,310
my ambitions?

51
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,630
The Rong family's members
admire talented people

52
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,490
and have always
let the most capable one be the head.

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,520
Lady Yunshu, you really know

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,920
how to deceive yourself.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,360
You clearly know that

56
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,710
all the younger members of the Rong family

57
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,840
are just whetstones for Rong Shanbao.

58
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,870
No matter how hard a stone is,

59
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,730
it can never compare with a knife,

60
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,400
let alone replacing it.

61
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,910
My Lady,

62
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,200
why don't we just report this
to the authorities?

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,240
If someone puts a knife on my neck,

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,850
then let's just take a good look

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,590
to see who might be injured

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
by this knife.

67
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,710
[Rong Mansion]

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,680
Old Madam!

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,820
Outside...

70
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,320
Who are you guys?

71
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,000
How dare you break into my place?

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,600
Tell me!

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,760
Where is the key
to the Rong family's treasury?

74
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,430
Grandmother.

75
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,430
What key?

76
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,870
I don't know.

77
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,680
Tell me! Where on earth is the key?

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
You wretched old hag!

79
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm afraid you can't survive
to spend the money you've been hoarding.

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,630
If you still refuse to tell me,

81
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,630
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

82
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,690
I'll kill your granddaughter first.

83
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,600
Yunshu!

84
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,350
Yunshu!

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
Who are you guys?

86
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,830
Who is it?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,510
Search!

88
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,360
You...

89
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,170
Take all the valuable stuff away.

90
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,950
Yunshu!

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,830
Yunshu!

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,740
My Lord, bad news!

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,270
I'm perfectly fine.

94
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,580
What happened?

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,360
Why are you so flustered?

96
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
The Rong Mansion was robbed by bandits,

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,720
and a young lady from the Rong family
is seriously injured.

98
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,120
Which young lady
from the Rong family is it?

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,510
It's not Lady Shanbao.

100
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,770
It's Lady Rong Yunshu.

101
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,560
Lady Yunshu.

102
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
Let's go. Gather everyone here.

103
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,650
I need to
visit the Rong Mansion personally.

104
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,120
You're finally here.

105
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,180
How did you know I would come, Mr. Yan?

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,190
The Rong family
is a prominent clan in Linji.

107
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,120
A midnight robbery
must be no small matter.

108
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,750
I reckoned you would certainly

109
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,780
come here to investigate it personally,

110
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,110
so I waited here for you.

111
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,510
What exactly is the matter

112
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,750
that has bothered you so much?

113
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,920
Something serious has happened inside.

114
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
Come with me quickly.

115
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,230
Repeat what you've just told me

116
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,700
-to her.
-Step aside!

117
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,360
Old Madam.

118
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,720
Those bandits

119
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,720
all came out from the Hualin Courtyard's

120
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,360
tunnel.

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,240
They were heading straight
for the Chongxi Hall

122
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,680
without alerting the guards
in the outer courtyard.

123
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,480
And the guard rotation schedule

124
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,970
changes every two months.

125
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,050
It's all...

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,540
It's all personally arranged by you,

127
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,750
Rong Shanbao.

128
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,490
Grandmother...

129
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,360
I...

130
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,780
Step aside!

131
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,090
I'm telling you to step aside!

132
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,120
Step aside!

133
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,000
Old Madam, in a rage,

134
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,360
you concluded that Lady Shanbao

135
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,800
was the culprit
after hearing just a few words.

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,330
Wasn't that a bit too hasty?

137
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,120
If she had truly betrayed the Rong family,

138
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,800
why would she reveal

139
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,120
the tunnel in the Hualin Courtyard?

140
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,720
That would only
bring trouble upon herself.

141
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,390
Old Madam,

142
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,630
Lady Shanbao heard that something happened
down the mountain.

143
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,950
Then she rushed back
to the Rong Mansion overnight.

144
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,840
She was worried about your safety.

145
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,510
Without distinguishing right from wrong,
you just hit her.

146
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,040
It's truly disheartening.

147
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,150
Why are you out
with such serious injuries?

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,360
Yunshu!

149
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,490
Grandmother.

150
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,190
Yunshu.

151
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,270
-Grandmother.
-You...

152
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,330
I don't think Shanbao is the culprit.

153
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,090
Shanbao
has dedicated herself to the Rong family

154
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,760
and shown complete filial devotion to you.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,860
The Rong family is her whole world

156
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,540
and even her only home.

157
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,070
She would never

158
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,930
collude with outsiders to rob our mansion.

159
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,730
Grandmother, there must be a mistake.

160
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,570
Someone else
must be the accomplice inside this house.

161
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,130
I don't think it's Shanbao.

162
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,290
Now that you're so badly injured,

163
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,110
you're still defending her.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,270
I brought her up.

165
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,050
Speaking of how ambitious she is,

166
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,030
no one knows it better than I do.

167
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,630
Precisely because she thinks of
the Rong family as everything,

168
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,760
losing it would be unbearable for her.

169
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,280
A person who has never experienced defeat

170
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,120
simply cannot accept failure!

171
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,000
Rong Shanbao.

172
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
As you resented me

173
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,720
for stripping you of the authority
to run the household,

174
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,650
you incited those bandits
to break into our mansion.

175
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,390
The tunnel's existence
has long been revealed.

176
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,789
As long as one was determined
to investigate it,

177
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,120
the guard rotation schedule
wouldn't be a secret for him.

178
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,669
None of these so-called pieces of evidence

179
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,549
can prove

180
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,549
that I've betrayed the Rong family.

181
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,470
Grandmother.

182
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,630
Others may suspect me.

183
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
Even you don't trust me, huh?

184
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,790
In your mind,

185
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,550
is your own granddaughter,

186
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,640
who you've carefully educated
for 20 years,

187
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,510
such an ungrateful

188
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,710
and disloyal person?

189
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,940
If it's not you,

190
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,000
who else would have such guts

191
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,600
to betray the Rong family
by colluding with outsiders?

192
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,550
Is it Yunxi,

193
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,120
Xiangling

194
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,550
or Yunshu?

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
You're taking revenge on me.

196
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,610
You want me to see with my own eyes,

197
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,960
without you, how chaotic

198
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,510
the Rong family would become.

199
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,390
You're deliberately seeking revenge!

200
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,320
Grandmother, I have never....

201
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,860
and will never betray the Rong family.

202
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,620
I won't!

203
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,060
Old Madam Rong.

204
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
A major robbery case happened in Linji.

205
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,910
As the Prefect, it is my duty to solve it.

206
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,290
I've dispatched men
to search the whole city

207
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,550
so that we can capture the bandits
as soon as possible.

208
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,030
Lady Shanbao is a woman of noble character

209
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,670
and always acts with integrity.

210
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,360
If she had wanted to compete
to run the Rong family's business,

211
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,200
why would she risk irritating you

212
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,960
by helping

213
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,090
Madam Yang, who has no relation to her?

214
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,270
A person
who truly has a strong desire for power

215
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,000
would never sacrifice himself

216
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,560
to help someone unrelated.

217
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,320
Moreover, to speak frankly,

218
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,720
if Lady Shanbao had wanted to take action,

219
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,750
wouldn't it be more efficient
to eliminate the enemy completely?

220
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,270
You...

221
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,620
Old Madam,
please use your wisdom and discernment.

222
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,950
Don't wrongly accuse an innocent person.

223
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,550
Grandmother, I didn't do it.

224
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,650
Please trust me.

225
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,080
Yunshu! Yunshu! Yunshu!

226
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,000
Yunshu!

227
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,280
Grandmother!

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,530
-Old Madam!
-Grandmother!

229
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,160
Grandmother!

230
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,120
-Grandmother!
-Grandmother!

231
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,870
Haven't you irritated Grandmother enough?

232
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,910
Do you want to irritate her

233
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,440
to death?

234
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,160
Grandmother!

235
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,160
Go back and wait for my news.

236
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,720
I promise you

237
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,660
I'll definitely
arrest the culprit for you.

238
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,210
The truth of the case
will be uncovered soon.

239
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,780
Just go back first.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,030
If Old Madam sees you,

241
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,440
she'll only be even angrier,

242
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,870
which will make things worse instead.

243
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,470
Don't worry. I'll stay here.

244
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,670
Thank you for your concern, Lord Lu.

245
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,120
I hope
you can arrest the real culprit soon

246
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
and clear my name.

247
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,330
Okay.

248
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,370
Within 10 days,

249
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,270
I will give you an answer.

250
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,450
Send for the doctor now!

251
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,750
Why are you standing there like a fool?

252
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,610
Bring some hot water here. Go now!

253
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,720
Yes!

254
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,520
Lady Shanbao.

255
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,120
You all may leave now.

256
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,600
Yes.

257
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,630
Mr. Bai.

258
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,150
Could you

259
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,250
let me talk to Yunshu for a moment?

260
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,670
You're awake.

261
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,320
It's just a minor injury.

262
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Grandmother was just angry today.

263
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,870
Please don't take it to heart, Shanbao.

264
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,760
When Grandmother feels better,

265
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
I will definitely send someone

266
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,850
to inform you immediately.

267
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,290
Asking a tiger for its skin
might make yourself get bitten instead.

268
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,110
Shanbao, do you know

269
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,360
how many steps it takes

270
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,020
to walk from your Qilan Garden

271
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,880
to Grandmother's Chongxi Hall?

272
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,080
I don't think you know that.

273
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,150
After all, you've been

274
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,150
pampered by everyone

275
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,240
since childhood.

276
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,430
How would you notice such trivial matters?

277
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,420
What are you trying to say?

278
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,750
From my courtyard to the Chongxi Hall,

279
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,670
it takes exactly 728 steps.

280
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,080
It took me 16 years

281
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,530
to finish this journey.

282
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,840
Shanbao.

283
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,670
I wonder which of us

284
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,360
could go farther in the future.

285
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,840
Bai, I'm in so much pain.

286
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,430
Now that just the two of us are here,

287
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,960
you don't need to pretend anymore.

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,670
I was watching coldly just now.

289
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,600
In the Chongxi Hall,

290
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,790
you tried so hard to defend Lady Shanbao,

291
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,440
which made Old Madam Rong
get more suspicious instead.

292
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,570
Did you really do that for her own good?

293
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,740
Yunshu.

294
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,750
Where did those bandits come from?

295
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,680
Do you truly know nothing about it?

296
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,760
You're the one who's framing Lady Shanbao.

297
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,070
I am your fiancé.

298
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,650
If you refuse to tell me the truth,

299
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,010
then I can no longer cover for you.

300
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,960
I have something else to tell Old Madam.

301
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,600
Don't go!

302
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Do you want to die?

303
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,670
I beg you! Please help me!

304
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,080
I beg you!

305
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,790
Alright.

306
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,930
I'm not going anywhere.

307
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,870
I'll stay right here.

308
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,230
I'll just stay here with you.

309
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,720
[Chongxi Hall]

310
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,320
The ginseng tonic is ready.

311
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,910
Let Old Madam have a cup of it first.

312
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,630
Then let her have a second cup of it
after midnight.

313
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,790
Only when Old Madam is awake

314
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,450
can she have some rice congee.

315
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,410
Dr. Sun, please forgive my intrusion.

316
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,750
How is Old Madam's condition?

317
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,360
Old Madam is over 60 years old.

318
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,680
Last night, her anger affected her heart.

319
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,750
Fortunately, a few days ago,

320
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,640
she took medicine to prevent stroke,

321
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,839
which saved her life.

322
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,680
However, in the coming days,

323
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,270
she still needs proper care and rest.

324
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,270
She must not exhaust herself again.

325
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,140
Please.

326
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,569
Mr. Yan, didn't you...

327
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,790
hear any movements
in the mansion last night?

328
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,790
Xinfang Pavilion
is the farthest from Chongxi Hall,

329
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,320
with a garden between them.

330
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:32,960
Those bandits

331
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
went through
the Hualin Courtyard's secret tunnel

332
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,910
to avoid alerting the guards
in the mansion.

333
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,780
If someone had not discovered

334
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,920
the unconscious night watchman
in the bushes

335
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
or summoned
the outer-courtyard guards in time,

336
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,580
I'm afraid the entire Rong family
would have been in great danger.

337
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,550
You're right.

338
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,030
These bandits came and went
without leaving a trace.

339
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,350
They headed straight for the Chongxi Hall.

340
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,270
Someone inside the Rong Mansion
must have colluded with them.

341
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,400
It couldn't possibly be Lady Shanbao.

342
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,000
The Rong family
is the most important in her mind.

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,750
Even if everyone else
betrayed the Rong family,

344
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,680
she never would.

345
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,880
That's true.

346
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,670
We found the traces of bandits
at the foot of the tea mountain.

347
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,970
What happened?

348
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,350
My Lord.

349
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,750
Holding the Governor's seal,
the garrison troops in Linji

350
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,550
are using the pretext
of eliminating bandits

351
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,640
to completely surround the tea mountain.

352
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,170
Let's go!
We'll talk further on the mountain.

353
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,810
Let's go!

354
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,630
Wanwan, look.

355
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,070
You must do it this way,

356
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,750
flipping them up
with your thenar eminence.

357
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,350
My Lady!

358
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,420
In this way, you won't get burned easily.

359
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,810
At a time like this,

360
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,030
you still have the mood
to teach her how to pan-fry tea leaves?

361
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,480
Rong Yunshu is even oppressing you now

362
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,740
and abusing her power.

363
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,330
If you're still my real sister,

364
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,540
go back to the Rong Mansion right now

365
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,120
and give her a good whipping.

366
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,240
Let's see if she still dares to
disrespect her superiors again.

367
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,640
Yunshu is badly injured.

368
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,690
She can't survive if I whip her.

369
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,110
It would be great if she dies.

370
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,570
Yunxi told me everything.

371
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,240
She pretended to be innocent
in front of Grandmother,

372
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,110
which made you get into great trouble.

373
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,680
Previously, I even thought

374
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,210
she had a good disposition.

375
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,130
It turns out that she's just

376
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,390
a despicable woman in sheep’s clothing.

377
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,440
The authority
of the eldest legitimate daughter

378
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,590
from the First Branch of our Rong family

379
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,590
isn't something she can challenge!

380
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,350
Just see how I'll flay her alive!

381
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm not being indignant for your sake,

382
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,600
but for our First Branch.

383
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,200
No matter how close sisters are,

384
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,730
there must still be a proper hierarchy.

385
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,480
The great contributions you've made

386
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,590
to the Rong family

387
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,210
can't be erased by anyone.

388
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,730
What's more, Mother...

389
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,080
Mother planned it for you
for so many years

390
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,440
that she didn't even close her eyes
when she died.

391
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,840
You can't give up this honorable position.

392
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,550
Wanwan, look.

393
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,120
Only in this way
can you avoid getting burned.

394
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,830
Rong Shanbao, did you hear that or not?

395
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,760
Lady Shanbao!

396
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,440
The soldiers
have surrounded the tea plantation!

397
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,040
Soldiers?

398
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,130
What soldiers?

399
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,510
What are they doing on our tea mountain?

400
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,270
Come on. Let's go out and take a look.

401
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,900
Lady Yunwan! Lady Yunwan!

402
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,390
I'll teach you. Let's continue.

403
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,000
Step aside, you all!

404
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The government is handling a case!

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,640
All irrelevant people
should get out of the way!

406
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,770
Search thoroughly!

407
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,790
Just find them even if you have to
turn the place upside down!

408
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,350
This tea mountain is a den of bandits!

409
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,400
If we can't find anything,

410
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,690
you guys will be held accountable, too!

411
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,650
Stop it now!

412
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,750
Just stop it!

413
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,050
What are you guys doing?

414
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,450
Go there!

415
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,090
Don't destroy this! Don't destroy it!

416
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,890
This is all from everyone's hard work.

417
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,120
You can't destroy it!

418
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
It's all from everyone's hard work.

419
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,290
Under the order
of the Governor, Lord Jiang,

420
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,400
we're on this mountain to capture bandits.

421
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,160
Anyone who dares to resist
will be killed on the spot!

422
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,830
Stop it!

423
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,560
Who are you?

424
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,270
Which commander are you under?

425
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,240
You're insolent and unscrupulous.

426
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,200
How dare you make trouble
in Rong's Plantation?

427
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,670
Don't try to touch anything agian!

428
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,620
You're openly

429
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,080
defying our search.

430
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,000
Do you want to harbor the criminals

431
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,540
and engage in illegal activities?

432
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,430
Guards! Arrest them!

433
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,720
You're talking nonsense!

434
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,110
The Rong Mansion was robbed.

435
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,070
In this world, no victim

436
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,480
would harbor the bandits.

437
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,790
You know this is Rong's Plantation,

438
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,720
but you still dare to barge in  here.

439
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,380
Do you have ulterior motives?

440
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,370
Arrest them!

441
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,110
Yi.

442
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,870
I'd like to see which of you dares.

443
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,410
Just see what's beneath your feet.

444
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,310
Those tea leaves beneath your feet

445
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,310
are the top-grade

446
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,550
Cold Dew Tea Leaves that will be delivered

447
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,150
to the capital in seven days.

448
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,750
They're only harvested three days before

449
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,070
and four days after the Cold Dew Day.

450
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,310
The harvest is only conducted
during these seven days each year.

451
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,960
In the entire world,

452
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,790
they're only grown on this mountain.

453
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,070
Even one liang of them
is extremely valuable.

454
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,070
When the imperial family
punishes people for this,

455
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,440
can your head

456
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,610
and the lives of your entire family

457
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,720
be kept safe?

458
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,550
Destroying imperial tea leaves
is an unforgivable crime.

459
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,930
There must be someone
taking responsibility for this crime.

460
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,190
Are you guys willing to
share the responsibility with him?

461
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,720
I didn't know
these were imperial tea leaves!

462
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
I was just following orders
to take action!

463
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,920
Please let us go!

464
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,030
I'm begging you!

465
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,830
My Lord, we're not bandits!

466
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,240
My Lord!

467
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,920
We're not bandits!

468
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,960
My Lord!

469
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,240
The Rong family has always been patriotic
and loyal to the monarch.

470
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,680
We once donated
several million taels of platinum

471
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,030
for the border warfare

472
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,510
and even tirelessly helped to
transport military provisions.

473
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,070
Everyone in the imperial court
admired and respected us.

474
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,310
The late Emperor bestowed the title

475
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,550
of Madam Anguo on my grandmother.

476
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,350
She can submit confidential memorials
directly to His Majesty.

477
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,550
What an honor that is!

478
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,180
The Rong family's loyalty

479
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,370
has long been recognized
by His Majesty's great insight.

480
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,590
Are the bandits hiding
in the tea plantation or not?

481
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,320
Did you see that clearly or not?

482
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,340
The Provincial Governor is here!

483
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,670
I'm Zhang Zhong.
Greetings, Your Excellency.

484
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,930
A gang of notorious bandits
has entered the city.

485
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,270
They robbed innocent households.
Their crimes are unforgivable.

486
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,160
As the official in charge of this region,

487
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,890
I have a heavy responsibility.

488
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,400
I will not allow the bandits
to get rampant

489
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,640
and disturb the peace of our citizens.

490
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,110
When I find out

491
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,840
who secretly
helped these bandits escape,

492
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,680
I will treat him as an accomplice.

493
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Zhang Zhong, search this place now!

494
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,400
Search!

495
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,960
Shanbao.

496
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,300
We can't let them act so absurdly!

497
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,140
Since we have nothing to hide,

498
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,720
what is there they cannot search?

499
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,320
Let them search as they wish.

500
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,350
I also want to see

501
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,680
what Lord Jiang can possibly find.

502
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,550
Over here! Quickly! Search! Hurry!

503
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,300
Over there!

504
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,750
Take it away!

505
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,410
-Yes!
-Yes!

506
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,160
My Lord, we found it.

507
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,350
Shanbao, well...

508
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:09,960
Shanbao.

509
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,080
This is Grandmother's treasured item.

510
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,760
Take her away!

511
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,740
Wait!

512
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,720
Rong Shanbao.

513
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,350
I even vouched for you

514
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,440
in front of

515
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,590
the Provincial Governor.

516
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,310
I can't believe you didn't even know

517
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,480
your own tea plantation had become

518
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,000
the place of hiding stolen goods.

519
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,930
How could you be so muddle-headed?

520
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,000
Lord Lu, you are mistaken about that.

521
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,100
I was expelled from the Rong family
by my grandmother,

522
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,640
which has long been known to all.

523
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,300
While my grandmother was ill,

524
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,240
by using the secret tunnel
in the Hualin Courtyard

525
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,110
to collude with bandits from outside,

526
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,310
firstly, this person could
increase his personal wealth,

527
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,710
and secondly, he could warn my grandmother

528
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,890
to make her realize

529
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,310
that the household cannot be
without a person in charge,

530
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,240
so she would summon me back sooner.

531
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,070
Rong Shanbao!

532
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,000
I suppose if you search further,

533
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,880
you'll find even more evidence against me.

534
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,640
As people say, when someone wants to
condemn you, he can always find a reason.

535
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,510
If Lord Jiang insists that I'm guilty,

536
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,840
whether I admit it or not

537
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,080
just doesn't matter.

538
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,640
Alright. If you admit it,

539
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,070
that would be good for everyone.

540
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,720
Guards!

541
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,400
Guards!

542
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,130
Arrest Rong Shanbao immediately!

543
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,880
Lord Lu, what do you mean by doing this?

544
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,160
My Lord, please calm down.

545
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,790
My Lord,
you've sent so many soldiers here today

546
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,360
to search the entire mountain.

547
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,310
Are you trying to find the bandits here?

548
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,570
Don't pretend you don't know the answer.

549
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,550
May I ask

550
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,960
what the value of this item is?

551
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,620
It's worth 300 taels at least.

552
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,530
What about this one?

553
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
It's worth no less than 1,000 taels.

554
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,200
My Lord.

555
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,240
According to our dynasty's laws,

556
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,960
if a robbery case occurs in a region

557
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,270
and the stolen silver exceeds 5,000 taels,

558
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,000
it counts as a major case that must be

559
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,160
reported to the Ministry of Justice
and His Majesty.

560
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,630
All officials of prefectures and counties,

561
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,610
including myself

562
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,810
and even you, My Lord,

563
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,550
will be held accountable
for negligence on precautions.

564
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,750
With the slightest incaution,

565
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,400
we would face impeachment
from the imperial censors.

566
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,200
What would you suggest, Lord Lu?

567
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,750
If Lady Rong Shanbao is put into prison
to wait for her conviction,

568
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,550
and you personally
conduct the interrogation,

569
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,240
everyone in Linji will feel insecure,

570
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,830
which will definitely cause panic
all over the city.

571
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,070
That's harmful
for your reputation as an official.

572
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,510
Why not let me investigate the case?

573
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,030
Whether she's hiding stolen goods
or being falsely accused,

574
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,170
we'd better find the bandits first

575
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,170
before deciding on the conviction.

576
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,360
Alright.

577
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,720
Lord Lu, since you're volunteering,

578
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,200
then this case

579
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
will be entrusted to you.

580
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,860
However,

581
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,430
if an official
is assigned to handle a case

582
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,230
and fails to

583
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,190
arrest the bandits within 10 days,

584
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,200
he'll be sentenced to 40 lashes
and be dismissed from his post.

585
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,880
Lord Lu,

586
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,210
can you bear this consequence?

587
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,110
I won't let you down, My Lord.

588
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,830
Guards!

589
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,330
Take all the stolen goods back
to the County Office, too!

590
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,810
Lady Rong Shanbao.

591
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,440
Everything in the prison
is simple and crude,

592
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,100
but this is kind of a good cell.

593
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,440
Sorry for the inconvenience.

594
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,840
Please stay in this cell.

595
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,440
It's fine.

596
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,330
If you need anything...

597
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,200
Rong Shanbao!

598
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,000
-What exactly are you trying to do?
-My Lord!

599
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,350
As the presiding judge,
you must avoid any suspicion.

600
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,280
Get out of my way!

601
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,470
I just don't understand.

602
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,070
You knew someone had tampered
with the tea plantation,

603
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,830
but you didn't even say a word
to defend yourself.

604
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,270
Do you have any idea

605
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,270
what a prison is like?

606
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,680
Do you think it's like the backyard
of your Rong Mansion?

607
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,160
If you had been sent
to the Provincial Governor's Office,

608
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,920
how could Jiang Yiqian possibly let you

609
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,680
get out alive?

610
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,510
He thinks of the Rong family

611
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,480
as a thorn in his flesh

612
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
and has long wanted to deal with you.

613
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,970
Aren't you quite capable?

614
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,850
Answer me!

615
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,530
Please calm down, My Lord.

616
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,760
Rong Shanbao!

617
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,240
Are you deaf or mute?

618
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,800
Aren't you here for me, My Lord?

619
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,550
Lord Lu, you're upright, impartial,

620
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,080
resourceful and decisive.

621
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,270
You redressed the injustice
in the Wei family's case.

622
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,640
There are few officials
as righteous as you in this world.

623
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,790
I believe
you can distinguish right from wrong,

624
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,750
bringing justice for an innocent person

625
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,510
like me.

626
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,480
My Lord! My Lord!

627
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,310
It's easy to invite the devil in,
but it's hard to make him leave.

628
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,110
Lord Jiang.

629
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,330
You've asked for this trouble yourself.

630
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,630
You can't blame me.

631
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,210
Grandmother refuses to see us?

632
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,710
We're here to visit her while she's sick.

633
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,910
Why would Grandmother avoid seeing us?

634
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,350
My dear sisters, you're here.

635
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,960
Yunshu.

636
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,610
Do you know
the officials found the stolen goods

637
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,400
in the tea plantation,

638
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,550
falsely accused Lady Shanbao
of being the ringleader

639
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,550
and took her away?

640
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,550
This matter concerns the century-old
reputation of the Rong family.

641
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,550
It's extremely serious.

642
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,550
Just let me in now.

643
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,160
I need to report it to Grandmother.

644
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,990
Xiangling.

645
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,100
You know Grandmother's temper.

646
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,030
She hates those who are blinded
by affections,

647
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,090
unfilial, rebellious and disloyal.

648
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,070
A person with all those traits

649
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
can never return to the Rong family.

650
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,280
The lessons learnt from the past
are still so vivid in our mind.

651
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,200
Others may be too foolish
to understand the situation.

652
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,720
Do you also not understand, Xiangling?

653
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,160
You...

654
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,650
Yunshu.

655
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,880
We are all Grandmother's granddaughters

656
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,750
and should take care of her
while she's sick.

657
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,030
How could we let you
bear this burden alone?

658
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,420
Besides, your own wound hasn't healed yet.

659
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,820
If you exhaust yourself,

660
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
it'll be harder for your injury to heal.

661
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,790
Yes, indeed.

662
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,510
Yunshu, you're such a delicate person,

663
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,110
but you still protected Grandmother
from the knife attack.

664
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,790
Your filial piety
can even move Heaven and Earth.

665
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,640
No one can take that merit away from you.

666
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,270
Just go back to recuperate
and don't worry.

667
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,480
We sisters can take turns
to look after Grandmother,

668
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,640
which is the proper way.

669
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,300
It's just a minor injury
and is nothing serious.

670
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,790
I know you all are concerned
about Grandmother.

671
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,790
She will appreciate your filial devotion.

672
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,720
But Grandmother is being sick now.

673
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,790
She's not only unable to
walk normally as usual

674
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,120
but also incapable of speaking properly.

675
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,200
Grandmother is a woman

676
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,510
of indomitable will.

677
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,060
She would never want anyone to see her

678
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,590
moving her limbs clumsily.

679
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,630
If you all insist on barging in,

680
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,640
which might irritate Grandmother,

681
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,960
I can't bear the consequences.

682
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,090
I insist on going in.

683
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,490
What can you do about it?

684
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,640
Get lost!

685
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,280
Tell them all to get lost!

686
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,360
Did you all hear that?

687
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,510
Please leave now.

688
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,640
Look! How authoritative

689
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,840
Lady Yunshu is today.

690
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,110
Is she still

691
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,550
your sweet and fragile fiancée

692
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,150
who's as delicate as dodder?

693
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,550
She's strong-willed

694
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,570
with formidable tactics.

695
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,440
How would she still need
anyone's protection?

696
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,030
How long

697
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,960
will you keep deceiving yourself?

698
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,310
This is a safety amulet

699
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,570
I got for Grandmother.

700
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,730
Being placed under her pillow,

701
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,680
it can calm her spirit and ward off evil.

702
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,400
People say in the capital,

703
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,160
there's an imperial physician
surnamed Hou,

704
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,550
whose ancestral wind-drawing decoction

705
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,790
has miraculous effects
on calming the liver and dispelling wind.

706
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,390
I've already asked someone
to invite him here.

707
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,990
He will arrive in Linji soon.

708
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,760
I'll come here
to greet her again tomorrow.

709
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,040
Yunshu, thanks for your hard work.

710
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Bye, Yunxi.

711
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,590
Yunshu, you're so smart

712
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,650
and quick-witted,

713
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,640
being the most outstanding one
among all the sisters.

714
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,830
I always knew you would
achieve a position like this today.

715
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,640
Don't worry.

716
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,270
I'm not on their side.

717
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,640
Currently, you've been

718
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,270
staying by Grandmother's side every day.

719
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,160
There are so many trivial matters
that you can hardly attend to everything.

720
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,690
I may not have other skills,

721
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,750
but I'm qutie good at
handling household affairs.

722
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,160
If there's anything bothering you,

723
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,360
just tell me, Yunshu.

724
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,440
I won't refuse to help.

725
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,280
I know you care about me, Yun'e.

726
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,880
Thank you for that.

727
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
I'll come talk to you again tonight.

728
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,680
You usually don't like

729
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,810
this fence-sitter.

730
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,400
In the past, she could side with Yunxi,

731
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,930
and now she can defect to me.

732
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Doesn't this show

733
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,960
the trend of popular sentiment
in the mansion?

734
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,920
After all, now I am

735
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,590
Grandmother's most trusted granddaughter.

736
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,320
Come with me.

737
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,150
Shixin.

738
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,239
From today onwards,

739
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,320
help me keep an eye on

740
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,050
Lady Yunshu's every movement.

741
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,880
Young Master, are you suspecting her?

742
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,480
Lady Shanbao is not in the mansion.

743
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,590
I have to help her guard against

744
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,120
those with ill intentions.

745
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,690
Lady Yunshu's behavior is suspicious.

746
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,889
We must be wary of her.

747
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,510
It hurts.

748
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,550
Why are you confining Old Madam?

749
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,030
Grandmother refuses to see outsiders.

750
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,000
How can a younger member
like me dissuade her?

751
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,800
As your fiancée,

752
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,960
I've just escaped death,

753
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,190
and despite my illness,
I have to deal with all the affairs,

754
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,719
but you've shown no concern

755
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,290
and are blaming me instead.

756
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,840
Bai, go back and think carefully.

757
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,880
If you still don't understand,

758
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,340
don't come to see me again.

759
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,409
Rumor has it that

760
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,440
back then, Old Madam

761
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,300
asked Third Master Rong
to escort the tea products.

762
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,280
As soon as the tea caravan left the city,

763
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,030
Old Madam
drove your mother away immediately,

764
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,030
causing her to freeze to death
in severe winter

765
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,150
in the Mountain God Temple.

766
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,320
There was even no simple coffin
for her burial.

767
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,230
When Third Master Rong got the news,

768
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,480
he rushed back desperately

769
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,210
and rode three horses to death,

770
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,480
but he still couldn't make it
for his wife's funeral.

771
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,210
He resented Old Madam so deeply

772
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,500
that he built a hut
beside his wife's grave to live there

773
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,710
and spent his days drinking.

774
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,970
He passed away in despair
within three years.

775
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,070
You hate Old Madam

776
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,360
for having belittled and mistreated you
since childhood.

777
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,840
You intend to seize control
of the Rong family.

778
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,760
It was you who framed Rong Shanbao.

779
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,480
Those bandits were also...

780
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,110
Shut up!

781
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,880
It was really you.

782
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,480
That's just some gossip on the street.

783
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,880
Don't take it seriously.

784
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,920
Bai.

785
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,510
You promised to help me,

786
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,070
but now you're suspicious of me
in every way.

787
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,600
I'm so disappointed in you.

788
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,510
If I had known this would happen,
I wouldn't have done that back then.

789
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,230
Yunshu.

790
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
I was planning to go to the capital
for the examination next month,

791
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,670
but now it looks like
I need to leave earlier.

792
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,590
Just leave with me

793
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,800
in three days.

794
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,640
What did you say?

795
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,840
Despite your silver tongue

796
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,960
and solemn promises,

797
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,710
I have eyes and can judge for myself.

798
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,590
I cannot stand by,

799
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,480
watching you sink deeper into this mire.

800
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,280
Either you come with me to the capital,

801
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,810
and then we can put everything behind us,

802
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,320
or I will expose everything

803
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,480
you've done

804
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,240
one by one in front of the people.

805
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,490
Bai Yingsheng, I hate you!

806
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,610
Just hate me as you wish.

807
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,680
See you in three days.

808
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,960
[Provincial Governor's Office]

809
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,710
My Lord,
we've searched the entire tea mountain.

810
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,030
Except for some stolen goods,

811
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,880
we still haven't found

812
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,340
any traces of the bandits.

813
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,190
Scribe Liu.

814
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,190
My Lord.

815
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,960
You've worked for me for so many years.

816
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,710
Tell me.

817
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,800
In my report to His Majesty,

818
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,190
what crime should I
charge Lu Jianglai with?

819
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,630
Here's my answer, My Lord.

820
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,110
Rong Shanbao
is the main culprit in this case,

821
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,630
and the stolen goods have been found, too.

822
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,590
However, the newly appointed
Prefect of Linji, Lu Jianglai,

823
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,670
has a personal relationship with her
and deliberately shields her.

824
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,000
My Lord, in this report,

825
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,770
you should accuse him
of perverting the law for personal favor

826
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,770
and betraying His Majesty's trust.

827
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
My Lord, no wonder that day,

828
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,550
you allowed him to leave so easily.

829
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,280
This is already

830
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,190
irrefutable evidence of his crime.

831
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,520
My Lord, you're so wise.

832
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,210
You just said

833
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,960
you didn't see

834
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,030
any traces of the bandits on the mountain.

835
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,960
In my opinion,

836
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,600
that shouldn't be the case.

837
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
I am foolish, sir.

838
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,110
Probably,

839
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,760
our search wasn't thorough enough.

840
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,480
There are thousands of tea farmers
on this tea mountain.

841
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,070
Hiding among them

842
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,470
would be extremely easy.

843
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,920
Please let me go check it out again.

844
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,580
I will definitely capture the bandits.

845
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,270
Go now.

846
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,960
Yes!

847
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,360
I'm leaving.

848
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,440
Go!

849
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,490
Behave yourself! Go over there!

850
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,880
Don't arrest me!

851
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,530
On what grounds can you do this?

852
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:45,960
Go now!

853
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,540
Don't move!

854
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,920
On what grounds can you do this?

855
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,070
I'm innocent!

856
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,590
That's right!
On what grounds can you arrest us?

857
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,590
Except for tea leaves,

858
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,670
how could there be bandits
on the mountain?

859
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,280
On what grounds
can you arrest people arbitrarily?

860
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,810
If you keep nagging,
you'll be arrested, too.

861
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:00,480
Let's go!

862
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,230
What crimes have we committed?

863
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,670
-Why are you arresting me?
-Hurry up!

864
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,280
Go!

865
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,190
We're honest people.

866
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,480
Please release us now!

867
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,510
Go!

868
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,010
Miss Xiu Qiong.

869
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,840
Most of them

870
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,110
have traveled far from their hometowns

871
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,070
to make a living here.

872
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,030
They know nothing
except growing tea leaves!

873
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,630
Most of them

874
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,020
have never even left the tea mountain.

875
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,550
How could they possibly be bandits?

876
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,410
Miss Xiu Qiong,

877
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,130
please find a way to save them!

878
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,590
But now, even Lady Shanbao

879
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,480
is in prison herself,

880
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,440
being unable to get rid of the trouble.

881
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,640
I'm just a lowly maid.

882
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,070
What solutions can I possibly have?

883
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,110
Tell me!

884
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,050
I'm not a bandit!

885
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
You're asking for a beating!

886
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,220
Officer, I'm really not a bandit!

887
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,030
Where are you from?

888
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm talking to you!

889
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,030
I'm...

890
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,970
I'm from the mountain.

891
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,030
My elder sister
came to work for Lady Shanbao,

892
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,290
so I came with her, too.

893
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,250
Lady Shanbao taught us
how to process tea leaves

894
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,510
and gave us food.

895
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,250
There are no free meals in this world.

896
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,630
You're saying Lady Rong Shanbao

897
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,630
taught you guys how to process tea leaves

898
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,840
and hired martial artists

899
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,190
to teach you fighting skills.

900
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,850
What exactly was her purpose?

901
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,150
Lady Shanbao said

902
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,450
by learning some martial arts skills,

903
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,320
in the future...

904
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,070
in the future,
while following tea caravans outside,

905
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,730
we would get triple the wages.

906
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,290
How come I don't believe that?

907
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,400
She kept private guards
in the tea plantation.

908
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,200
She must be plotting something.

909
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,100
Tell me! Were you the one

910
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,440
who robbed the Rong Mansion?

911
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,030
No.

912
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,280
Not you, huh?

913
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,860
Then tell me who it was.

914
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,400
Was it him?

915
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,470
Or him?

916
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,480
I'm innocent!

917
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,320
Or him?

918
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,360
If it was not him,

919
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,500
then it must be you!

920
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,510
It was him.

921
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,320
What a coward.

922
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,840
Boy, you're kind of honest.

923
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,840
It's just that you're a bit inarticulate.

924
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,670
Take him away.

925
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,030
Teach him how to speak properly.

926
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,360
Go!

927
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,000
My Lord.

928
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,510
The evidence of keep private soldiers...

929
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,150
Idiot!

930
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,670
If the Provincial Governor says
there is such evidence,

931
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,000
then there must be some.

932
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,130
As for those bandits
who are hiding somewhere...

933
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,030
Aren't these all of them?

934
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,630
Yes.

935
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,830
[Rong Mansion]

936
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,890
-My Lady!
-My Lady!

937
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,800
I'm Lady Yunyin from the Rong Mansion.

938
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,710
I need to see Grandmother.

939
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,710
How dare you stop me?

940
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,280
Step aside!

941
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,550
We're just following orders to do this.

942
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,510
Please understand this, Lady Yunyin.

943
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,510
Don't make things difficult for us.

944
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,490
Following orders? Whose orders?

945
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,590
When did the Rong family

946
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,520
get a new master?

947
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,190
All of you, get out of my way!

948
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,720
Who's making such noise
outside the mansion?

949
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,280
So it's you, Yunyin?

950
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,480
Yun'e, I need to see Grandmother.

951
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,740
Help me inform her now.

952
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,880
Have you forgotten

953
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,280
what you did previously?

954
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,670
I'm afraid
Grandmother doesn't want to see you.

955
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,230
There are orders from the Chongxi Hall.

956
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,910
Grandmother
needs to stay indoors and rest quietly.

957
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,800
She won't see any external visitors.

958
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,200
What are you waiting for?

959
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,030
Come on.

960
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,070
Rong Yun'e, how dare you!

961
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,510
I am also Grandmother's granddaughter.

962
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,640
Insolent servants!

963
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,240
Who allowed you to touch me?

964
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,090
Evne Grandmother's once favorite
granddaughter

965
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,460
is imprisoned now,

966
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,590
but she hasn't

967
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,850
asked about her at all.

968
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,800
Times have changed,
and everything is different now.

969
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Only your own sister

970
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,360
still lets you maintain your bad temper.

971
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,760
Nowadays,
who else would have time for you?

972
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,090
Close the door.

973
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,080
Grandmother!

974
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,590
Are you going to ignore Shanbao too?

975
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,360
Shanbao has been framed!

976
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,670
Grandmother!

977
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,110
Grandmother!

978
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,750
[Grandmaster of Tea]

979
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,680
Wanwan, look.

980
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,110
You must do it this way,

981
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,960
flipping them up
with your thenar eminence.

982
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,220
In this way, you won't get burned easily.

983
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,760
Grandmasters of Tea in the Ming Dynasty
weren't scholars.

984
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,590
They were teahouse waiters

985
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,360
who were proficient in tea arts.

986
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,840
They were commonly found in teahouses

987
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,000
and scholarly gatherings.

988
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,230
Grandmasters of Tea excelled at

989
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,650
evaluating tea, selecting water
and controlling the boiling state.

990
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,080
They were especially adept at
brewing loose tea.

991
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,230
They could match different tea varieties

992
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,610
with appropriate purple-clay teapots
or blue-and-white cups.

993
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,510
Grandmasters of Tea
were not only skilled in tea arts

994
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,670
but also refined in speech and manner.

995
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,600
While brewing tea,

996
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,400
they could even turn it
into a performance.

997
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,440
Teahouses flourished in the Ming Dynasty.

998
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,730
Grandmasters of Tea
earned handsome incomes.

999
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,230
They were both service providers

1000
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,960
and inheritors of tea traditions,

1001
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,480
known as the prototypes
of modern tea artists.
