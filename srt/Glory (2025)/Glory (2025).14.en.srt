00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,770
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,060
Lady Rong, I've brought him here.

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,039
It was you who killed my granddaughter?

5
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,710
Lady Rong,

6
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,070
what makes you say that?

7
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,950
Mr. Bai,

8
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,780
Lady Yunwan was tragically

9
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,350
found drowned in the back garden.

10
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,410
The garden patrol claimed

11
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,350
to have seen you fleeing in panic

12
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,290
through the east corner gate.

13
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,400
Explain yourself to Lady Rong immediately.

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,040
I didn't.

15
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,039
Lady Rong,

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,810
it wasn't me.

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,900
Tonight...

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Think carefully.

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,840
Who were you with tonight?

20
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,190
It was Mr. He.

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,860
It was He Xingming.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,150
He invited me for drinks.

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,750
He said...

24
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,280
Lady Rong.

25
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,150
Mr. Bai is indeed telling the truth.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,079
Tonight I prepared a feast

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,750
and invited him to join me.

28
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,520
However...

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,430
Just yesterday you loathed him to the bone

30
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,829
and swore to be his mortal enemy.

31
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,030
Yet tonight you sat with him for a drink.

32
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,310
Mr. He, your feelings

33
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,920
change rather quickly.

34
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,079
There was never any deep hatred
between us.

35
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,030
Plus, Lady Yunxi mediated between us.

36
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,840
What grievance

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,100
couldn't be resolved?

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,680
But Mr. Bai has little tolerance for wine,

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,590
and he grew tipsy after only two cups.

40
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,430
I personally

41
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,090
escorted him back to his room.

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,050
Then I went back to my room to sleep.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,750
I have no idea

44
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,430
whether he sobered up later

45
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,520
or where he went.

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,700
I remember now.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,400
During the meal,
Mr. Bai seemed utterly distracted,

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,260
muttering constantly that he had

49
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,550
certain appointment

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,590
with Lady Yunshu.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
I suppose
he sneaked into the rear courtyard

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
to meet Lady Yunshu.

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,840
Yunshu?

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,820
I had my maid Daisy take him a message,

55
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,040
saying I'd meet him
in the garden at 9 in the evening.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,030
I waited under the peach tree
in the west garden,

57
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,290
but he never showed up,

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,870
so I had to go back.

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,910
The message clearly said
to meet at 11 p.m.

60
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,710
at the southeast gate.

61
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,250
If there is a written note,

62
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,180
then where is it?

63
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,680
It was on me.

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,460
I kept it in my pocket.

65
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,920
How could it be missing?

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,870
Murder always has a motive.

67
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
Mr. Bai held no grudge

68
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,820
against Lady Yunwan.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
Why would he harm her?

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,590
If Lady Yunwan had any enemies,

71
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,910
unless...

72
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,900
Could it be about those shoes?

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,810
Was it because of the shoes?

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,080
What shoes?

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,089
Can you explain more clearly?

76
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,230
Grandmother,

77
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,300
Yunyin suddenly remembered today

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,510
that there was
a bloodstain in Mr. Yang's room.

79
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,910
That bloodstain turned out to be Wanwan's.

80
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,560
That bloodstain really was Wanwan's?

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,700
You recognized it all along?

82
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,620
Forgive me, Grandmother.

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,210
Wanwan was still very young

84
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,710
and quite simple-minded.

85
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,680
No one in the mansion ever stopped her
from wandering around.

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,000
She must have entered
that room by accident.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
I was afraid that if word spread,

88
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,580
people would gossip about it,

89
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,760
so I didn't dare
to speak up right away.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,330
I quietly burned the shoes.

91
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,800
I suppose

92
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,510
that Yunwan must have seen something

93
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,920
she shouldn't have that night,

94
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,320
and that was
what brought about her demise.

95
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,600
Could it be...

96
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,840
Who's there?

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
What are you sneaking around for?

98
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,990
Lady Rong.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,360
I am Hua who manages

100
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,390
tea serving at Xinfang Pavilion.

101
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,950
I heard commotion in the garden,

102
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,600
so I came to see
what was happening out of curiosity.

103
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Lady Rong.

104
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,800
He is a servant of the mansion,

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,070
temporarily assigned to Mr. Bai

106
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,800
to attend to his writing needs.

107
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,070
How dare you deceive Lady Rong right here?

108
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,270
Speak the truth or receive fifty lashes!

109
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,920
Mercy!

110
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,820
I'll talk! I'll talk!

111
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,360
Lady Rong.

112
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,250
If Mr. Bai really killed someone,

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,909
it'd have nothing to do with us servants,

114
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,240
please don't arrest me.

115
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,830
He used to

116
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,240
curse Mr. Yang frequently,

117
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,870
calling him vile, shameless,

118
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,870
and a total bully.

119
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,690
He also said...

120
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,900
What did he say?

121
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,000
Sometimes he said

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,870
Miss Rong was blind in both eyes and heart

123
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,800
for choosing such a scoundrel.

124
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,510
Other times he said Mr. Yang

125
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,340
was unworthy of his position

126
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,120
and would meet with catastrophic disaster.

127
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,520
Mr. Yang died violently,

128
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,920
and Lady Yunwan was also gone.

129
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
Something Mr. Bai used to say

130
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,870
comes back to me now,

131
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,680
and I became more and more frightened.

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,210
That...That's why I came
to look into things.

133
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,950
You're lying!

134
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,240
When did I ever say such things?

135
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,160
Well, well!

136
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,430
Now there's no way of denying it.

137
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,890
You killed Yang Dingchen,

138
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,450
and Wanwan accidentally discovered it,

139
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,480
so you simply steeled your heart

140
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,140
and killed her as well? Right?

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,070
If the night patrol hadn't found out,

142
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,330
who would have suspected that it was you?

143
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,540
Lady Yunshu.

144
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,360
I remember you personally said

145
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,409
that on the day Mr. Yang was killed,

146
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,850
you were with Mr. Bai.

147
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
Please testify for Mr. Bai.

148
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,409
Yunshu?

149
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,159
I...I...

150
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,920
Lady Rong.

151
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,150
Lady Yunshu was talking with Mr. Bai,

152
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,070
and I was only watching from a distance.

153
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,360
Later, the night breeze grew too chilly,

154
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,870
so I went back to get a cloak for her.

155
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,600
When I returned,

156
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,320
Mr. Bai had only just come back as well.

157
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,910
At that moment, Yunshu mentioned
catching the scent of peach blossoms,

158
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,500
so I thought to pick

159
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,560
a few of the prettier flowers for her.

160
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,270
The walk between the peach grove
and Qilan Garden

161
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,070
takes no more than10 minutes.

162
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,780
I'm afraid Yunshu's alibi

163
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,510
won't hold.

164
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,360
Yunshu?

165
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,760
What happened on earth?

166
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,760
I'm just a blind woman.

167
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,390
How would I know

168
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,190
if others lied to me?

169
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,870
You force me to testify,

170
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,950
but who can I testify for?

171
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,890
Lady Rong has always been fair and strict.

172
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,750
This is a matter of life and death.

173
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,330
Somebody seeks to weave wild speculation

174
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,600
from mere scraps of words,

175
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,710
passing life-and-death judgments
on shadows without substance.

176
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,060
If this were to spread, it'd tarnish

177
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,790
the Rong family's reputation.

178
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,700
Please, Lady Rong,

179
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,040
to give us a few more days,

180
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,650
so we can find out solid evidence

181
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,950
We must not wrongly accuse
an innocent person.

182
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,800
With so many witnesses and evidence,

183
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,720
we practically caught them red-handed.

184
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,430
Mr. Lu,

185
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,560
what more evidence do you need?

186
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,240
You're not in cahoots with them, are you?

187
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,650
You...

188
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,430
Enough!

189
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,180
Stop this arguing.

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,860
The Rong family can't pass judgment.

191
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,730
Had them bound
and taken to the government tonight!

192
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Yes.

193
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,830
During the court inquiry,

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
besides the suspect,

195
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,770
they'll certainly
question everyone involved.

196
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,490
This servant, Hua, accused Bai Yingsheng

197
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,960
of killing out of hatred and jealousy,
so he must go.

198
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
As for the others,

199
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,310
Mr. He who invited the suspect
for drinks that night,

200
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,620
the servant Hesi
who served them during the meal,

201
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,740
and those on duty at Qilan Garden,

202
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,039
Xinfang Pavilion,

203
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,120
and the garden,

204
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,200
must all go as well.

205
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,780
You have no right to talk here.

206
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,470
Grandmother,

207
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,080
Mr. Lu is absolutely right.

208
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,840
To give Yunwan justice,

209
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,360
everyone who should be questioned
must be questioned.

210
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,910
Good.

211
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,360
Let's do as you say.

212
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,970
Wanwan hated being confined.

213
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,610
She was especially afraid of silence.

214
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,250
If she were locked in a room,

215
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,530
she'd cry, make a scene,

216
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,540
and refuse to eat for days.

217
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,150
It was my fault.

218
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,950
I should have kept her confined.

219
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,790
If I were Lady Yunwan,

220
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,290
I wouldn't want to survive

221
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,800
by being locked up like an animal.

222
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,270
Nobody could go against her will

223
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,440
and imprison her

224
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,970
in this small room forever.

225
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,440
If anyone were guilty,

226
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,080
those who killed and harmed her
should be the guilty ones.

227
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,280
How could you have done anything wrong?

228
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,740
I know you're feeling terrible,

229
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,760
but this is not the time
to drown in sorrow.

230
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,400
He Xingming and Lady Yunxi

231
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,520
have far greater ambitions.

232
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,600
Their target was never

233
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
Bai Yingsheng alone.

234
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,870
You must be careful.

235
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,970
Be very cautious.

236
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,480
You mean...

237
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,540
No thief can hide forever.

238
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,320
What they're truly after

239
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,110
will be clear in a day or two.

240
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,180
I wish to arrange Wanwan's funeral first.

241
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,430
Who told you to take a life?

242
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,950
When we discussed it,

243
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,550
didn't you nod in agreement as well?

244
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,810
What are you angry about now?

245
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,340
I only told you to scare her,

246
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,440
to force her to tell what she saw

247
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,630
in the bridal chamber.

248
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,390
I had my own way

249
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,120
to make her turn against Rong Shanbao

250
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,700
and reveal
the true or false Tea Bone case.

251
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,510
Who told you to actually kill her?

252
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,920
Although she was simple-minded,

253
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,160
she was still my cousin

254
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,890
and a member of the Rong family.

255
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,390
You've broken my principles!

256
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
What principles do you have?

257
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,360
I resent Old Madam Rong's favoritism

258
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
and can't stand Rong Shanbao's dominance,

259
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,030
but I have my principles as well.

260
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,600
I'd never use

261
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,870
such despicable means

262
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,510
to murder

263
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,170
a mentally disordered child.

264
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,000
What nonsense about the Tea Bone.

265
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,550
Only people from the Rong family

266
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,150
care about such empty words.

267
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,120
How could the good reputation Rong Shanbao

268
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,200
built over many years in the tea business

269
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,480
be undone

270
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,030
by this counterfeit Tea Bone?

271
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,490
Now look what's happened.

272
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,120
Rong Yunwan

273
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,650
died under her protection.

274
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,870
How can she escape responsibility?

275
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,320
Lady Rong may not say it,

276
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,250
but she's furious inside.

277
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,000
You seem to hate her even more than I do.

278
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,030
You're so passionate about

279
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,200
these harmful and spiteful deeds.

280
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,670
I do hate her.

281
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,120
We've been at odds

282
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,030
since the first day we met, at fourteen.

283
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,150
All these years of
rivalry between our families

284
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,410
have only made me despise her to the bone.

285
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
But everything I do

286
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,600
is for you.

287
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,890
We're meant to be a devoted couple.

288
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,030
Of course, I want the Rong family

289
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,160
to be in your hands as soon as possible.

290
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,830
Just wait patiently.

291
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,250
In the future,

292
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,090
there'll be many more shows
for you to watch.

293
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,550
Yunxi,

294
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,870
you should get a man
of gentle and kind character.

295
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,460
The one you've got

296
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,830
is a predator.

297
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,600
Look,

298
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,630
who knows how long

299
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,840
he's been plotting?

300
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,960
He even managed to buy off those

301
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,420
who served Bai Yingsheng.

302
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,170
In my life, I despise nothing more than

303
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,560
arrogant, ill-mannered men

304
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,090
who don't know their place.

305
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,900
No wonder Rong Shanbao didn't like him.

306
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,700
If he were to enter the Rong family,

307
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,300
he'd bring nothing but trouble,

308
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,400
and become the cause
of our family's downfall.

309
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,330
If I didn't still need to use him...

310
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,790
However, I've noticed

311
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,870
that Yunyin's expression

312
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,930
didn't look right.

313
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,710
She acts tough, lacks courage,

314
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,120
hesitates to make decisions,

315
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
and can't dwell on weighty matters.

316
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,870
We must keep this from her for now.

317
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,130
I'll keep an eye on her.

318
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,370
I know you care deeply for Yunwan.

319
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,000
It'd be enough to ask the monks
to chant sutras

320
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,230
for a few more days
to help her soul find peace.

321
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,960
But you bathed her, combed her hair,
changed her clothes,

322
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,120
and then even personally escorted her out,

323
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,720
which broke a serious taboo.

324
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,060
Grandmother was furious about this.

325
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,080
First of all,

326
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,680
according to our family principles,

327
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,920
women handle births,
and men handle funerals.

328
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,440
No matter how close you are to someone,

329
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,150
funeral matters

330
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,630
should be handled by men.

331
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,750
By personally handling the funeral,

332
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,680
if you exposed yourself to bad luck,
what could we do?

333
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,510
Secondly,

334
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,870
Yunwan's situation was already awkward.

335
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,910
In Linji City,

336
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,110
there was no such person as Lady Yunwan.

337
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,140
Grandmother had good reason
to not hold a funeral.

338
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
But by doing this,

339
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,200
you've given people reasons

340
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
to gossip in front of Grandmother

341
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,930
and make up your faults.

342
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,070
I'm not afraid of gossip,

343
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,550
and Yunwan wouldn't object to

344
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,550
the Rong family
presiding over the funeral.

345
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,600
When she was born,

346
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,900
I was the first to hold her.

347
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,870
When she passed away,

348
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,150
it'd be enough
that I alone could see her off.

349
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,750
Wanwan loved bright colors.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,960
Bring me the new outfit

351
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,560
I made for her in pale yellow.

352
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,510
Miss Rong,

353
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,170
we're still sisters after all.

354
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,030
No matter how harsh our words,

355
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,830
we can't let her go in our hearts.

356
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,440
Even if Miss Rong doesn't mention it,

357
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,720
we should still come and pay our respects.

358
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,460
How many days will she be laid out

359
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,580
before the burial?

360
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,840
Is there anything we can help with?

361
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,480
Though it's not proper
for us to manage funerals,

362
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
we should still come and see her.

363
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,630
The funeral procession
will begin tomorrow at 2 a.m.,

364
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,160
ground-breaking at 4 a.m.,

365
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,120
and she'll be buried at around 7:45 a.m.

366
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,840
That fast?

367
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,610
Miss Rong consulted
a fortune teller about this.

368
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,930
Yunwan died tragically,

369
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,350
so she must be buried
within the first seven days

370
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,550
and can't get into the family tomb

371
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,480
to avoid offending
our family's ancestors.

372
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,200
Regarding Yunwan's funeral,

373
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,910
I will arrange everything personally.

374
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,440
Outsiders don't need
to be concerned about it.

375
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,240
Please leave.

376
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,330
Outsiders?

377
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,550
Am I no longer part of
the primary branch of the family?

378
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,870
Am I no longer her sister?

379
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,840
You're taking over
all of Yunwan's funeral arrangements

380
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,960
and not allowing us to help at all.

381
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,690
How dare you be so domineering?

382
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,600
You are her sister?

383
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,370
Who do you think you're?

384
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,720
Miss Rong has instructed

385
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
that tomorrow at 2 a.m.,

386
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,750
all young ladies should stay away

387
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,150
to avoid getting exposed to bad luck

388
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,080
and offending Lady Rong's taboos.

389
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,270
If you don't want me
to see her off, then alright!

390
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,320
You think I care?

391
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,720
You just go bury that dead girl,

392
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
and never come back!

393
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,030
Yunyin,

394
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,470
-Yunyin, wait for me!
-Lady Yunyin.

395
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,610
Have you all heard?

396
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,510
The Rong family
is involved in a murder case.

397
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,400
They all say that Miss Rong

398
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
is a fake Tea Bone.

399
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,440
She conspired with her lover

400
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,100
and killed
the real Tea Bone of the Rong family.

401
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
That's nonsense!

402
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,750
We have all witnessed

403
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,000
Miss Rong's talent.

404
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,550
The tea she roasted by hand

405
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,360
once fetched
astronomical prices in the capital,

406
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,830
and countless tea plantations

407
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,960
owed their thriving to her generosity.

408
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,220
How could that be fake?

409
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,740
Well, it's hard to say.

410
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,970
I heard from
the manager of Huang's tea house

411
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,510
that the debate
of real versus fake Tea Bone

412
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,270
has been going on for a long time.

413
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,920
At that Tea Ancestor Festival Ceremony,

414
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,680
two people

415
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,880
had a huge argument

416
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
over the real and fake Tea Bone issue.

417
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,720
Is that so?

418
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,790
Tell us more!

419
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,240
-Yes, tell us!
-Yes!

420
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,500
Let me tell you slowly.

421
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,510
On the day of
Tea Ancestor Festival Ceremony...

422
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,710
Sir, it's here.

423
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,410
My Lord.

424
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,960
My Lord.

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,030
That He Xingming
is from a prominent family

426
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,550
and can't be touched lightly.

427
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,590
We took all the others
back to the Government Office

428
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,850
and detain them temporarily.

429
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,910
As you instructed,

430
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,720
we've detained Bai Yingsheng separately

431
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,520
and put everyone else together.

432
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,820
We've left a spy

433
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,960
to see if anyone
tries to coordinate their stories.

434
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,750
But that Hua

435
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,550
insists

436
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,310
he only overheard some casual talk

437
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,550
and keeps crying that he's been wronged.

438
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,400
These servants of noble families

439
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
are very cunning.

440
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,400
No matter how much they're tortured,

441
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,660
they act deaf and mute,

442
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,380
refusing to say anything.

443
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,130
Since I got into the Rong family

444
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,510
and had a informant by my side,

445
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,640
I've realized how formidable they are.

446
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,590
Though masters flaunt their status,

447
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,640
the servants,
bound by their own alliances in the dark,

448
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,970
have the sharpest ears.

449
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,200
Few secrets in this mansion

450
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,270
ever slip past them.

451
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,120
I need to find a way

452
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,180
to pry open their clam-like silence.

453
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,110
But how?

454
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,310
Young Master, what are you doing?

455
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,020
Jun Dai.

456
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
You disappear every day around 4 p.m.

457
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,010
You deliver
messages to Miss Rong, don't you?

458
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,680
You wronged me, Young Master!

459
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,750
How would I dare?

460
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,220
You're a servant of the Rong family.

461
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,110
Taking orders from Miss Rong

462
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,310
is quite reasonable.

463
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,350
I won't blame you.

464
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,050
But I need to ask you something.

465
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,920
Who am I

466
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,830
to Miss Rong?

467
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,880
When you first came to the Rong family,

468
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,680
Miss Rong used to ask

469
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,790
about your whereabouts,

470
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,960
who you met each day,

471
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,240
and what you talked about, Young Master.

472
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,640
As time went on,
she asked less frequently.

473
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,960
But since the past month,

474
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,920
Miss Rong

475
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,640
has often summoned me again.

476
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,750
She only asks whether you applies
your medicine on time,

477
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,070
if your old injuries have healed,

478
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,160
if the meals are to your taste,

479
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,130
and if you sleep peacefully.

480
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,000
Nothing else.

481
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,200
With Miss Rong caring so deeply,

482
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,000
your position is clear without asking.

483
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
As long as I have any sense at all,

484
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,860
I wouldn't dare speak out of turn.

485
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,710
Is that so?

486
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,240
Do you have some task

487
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,870
for me to carry out, Young Master?

488
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,540
I do have something to ask you to do,

489
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,200
but it involves a murder case.

490
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,940
Who I've met recently,

491
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,150
what I've said,

492
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,540
and the tasks I've asked you to do,

493
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,310
none of these

494
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,710
can be known by Miss Rong.

495
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,510
Do you dare to take this order?

496
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,350
I've been serving by your side

497
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,070
and have long recognized
your exceptional intelligence

498
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,920
and formidable skills, Young Master.

499
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,640
You're destined for greatness.

500
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,230
My little tricks

501
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,000
can't escape your keen eye.

502
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,400
I come from humble origins,

503
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,200
and in the Rong family,

504
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm nothing but a lowly servant.

505
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,160
If you honor me with your recognition,

506
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,750
I'd be willing to serve you loyally

507
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,150
and also
secure a better future for myself.

508
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,470
Come, stand up.

509
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,000
Sit.

510
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,460
This...

511
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,020
When I tell you to sit, you just sit.

512
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,450
This time, you're not watching me

513
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
on behalf of your Miss Rong anymore?

514
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,750
But you and Miss Rong

515
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,110
will be family sooner or later.

516
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,400
So my loyalty to you

517
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,240
is loyalty to Miss Rong as well.

518
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,310
From now on,

519
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,720
I won't speak what shouldn't be spoken,

520
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,070
won't ask what shouldn't be asked,

521
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,160
and will act solely on your orders,
Young Master.

522
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,720
Good.

523
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,540
I order you to spend a few days in prison.

524
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,070
We've been locked up here for two days.

525
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,920
When will My Lord hear our case?

526
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,480
He's coming!

527
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,220
Lord Cai!

528
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,830
Lord Cai, we are innocent people

529
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,070
who work honestly for our masters.

530
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,130
Please don't wrongfully condemn us.

531
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,640
What's going on here?

532
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,760
Aren't you the one who follows

533
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,560
Mr. Lu around?

534
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,370
How did you end up in here too?

535
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,750
Your backside is beaten to a pulp.

536
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,840
How pitiful.

537
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,170
What has lord been asking about?

538
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,880
Yes, exactly.

539
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,280
How the hell would I know?

540
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,720
I was thrown in here for no reasons.

541
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
They questioned me today,

542
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,310
and tomorrow it will be your turn.

543
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,880
None of you grasshoppers
come autumn will escape their fate.

544
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,510
Just wait.

545
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,920
It's sunset already,

546
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,960
but the meal hasn't been delivered yet.

547
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,260
Are you trying to starve my Young Master?

548
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,070
Well, you...

549
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,440
We're cooking. Yes, we're.

550
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,550
I'll bring it to you shortly.

551
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,440
I have other duties to attend to.

552
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,930
Let go!

553
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,750
-Shixin.
-Don’t go.

554
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,430
Let him go.

555
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,520
Young Master.

556
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,060
Go. Leave.

557
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,110
I have something here.

558
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,110
Take this for now.

559
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,450
Xinfang Pavilion is short-staffed.

560
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,380
It's causing some inconvenience.

561
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,120
Steward Cheng
has already arranged for new,

562
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,580
capable personnel to be transferred.

563
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,990
I sincerely ask for
Mr. Yan's understanding and forgiveness.

564
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,790
Not a problem.

565
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,770
I just hope Lord Lang

566
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,600
can uncover the truth soon.

567
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,450
Young Master, don't be fooled by him.

568
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,920
He personally brought you food,

569
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,520
clearly acting as if he's the host.

570
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,640
What kind intentions
could he possibly have?

571
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:27,960
As for this food box

572
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,350
with golden phoenix and peony patterns,

573
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,440
I've seen it before.

574
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,120
It belongs to Hualin Courtyard.

575
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,200
Miss Rong was worried
that he might be starving,

576
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,590
so she sent someone to bring him food.

577
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,510
He deliberately came to you,

578
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,440
just to show off.

579
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,030
You knew this and still accepted it?

580
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,550
Yes.

581
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,030
Young Master, after you finish eating,

582
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,640
you can return the food box
to Hualin Courtyard yourself.

583
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,110
Miss Rong has just lost
her dear family,

584
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,350
so she must be heartbroken.

585
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,410
Young Master, please go comfort her.

586
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,920
We can then put some pressure on him,

587
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,320
making him lose
both the battle and the war.

588
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,170
You have such sharp eyes

589
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,550
and such a clear mind.

590
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,270
How come you didn't notice

591
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,130
someone is missing from his side?

592
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,150
Weren't all the servants

593
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,440
from Xinfang Pavilion taken away?

594
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,180
When will they release us?

595
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,310
Bring the prisoner.

596
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,620
Someone's coming.

597
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,920
Get up.

598
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,770
Lord wants to question you.

599
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,280
The wounds
on my backside haven't healed yet.

600
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,040
Why me again?

601
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,160
I've already told you everything.

602
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,590
Can you
release me after the interrogation?

603
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,320
Release you?

604
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,970
This is a serious murder case.

605
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,750
Until the real culprit is caught,

606
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,210
Lord can't close the case.

607
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,740
If this drags on for a year or more,

608
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,720
even our lord will be impeached.

609
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,070
By then,

610
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,000
all of you

611
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,360
will just rot in here.

612
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,110
Have mercy, My Lord!

613
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,240
Have mercy, My Lord!

614
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,750
We don't know anything!

615
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,270
My Lord!

616
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,400
My Lord!

617
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,080
We've been wronged, My Lord!

618
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,820
Do you want to get out?

619
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,480
Remember the amount I mentioned yesterday?

620
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,810
What do you mean by that?

621
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Even if you were to weigh me on the scale

622
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,550
and stick a selling tag on me,

623
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,550
I still couldn't
scrape together twenty taels.

624
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,010
Look at how stingy you are.

625
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,830
I won't take your money for nothing.

626
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,480
You know, in this Government Office,

627
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,550
from top to bottom,

628
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,530
the jailers, the guards,

629
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,680
the advisors, the clerks,

630
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,340
who doesn't need to be bribed?

631
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,640
How could we release

632
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,110
a living person

633
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,170
as if they're just nothing randomly?

634
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,960
You must be joking.

635
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,580
We haven't killed or committed arson.

636
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,180
If lord can't find evidence,

637
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,030
he'll have to release us sooner or later.

638
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,820
Do you know what kind of place
this Government Office is?

639
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,130
Keeping interrogating

640
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,990
and being locked up
for three to five months

641
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,120
happen all the time.

642
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,550
All witnesses must be registered.

643
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,080
Once it's written clearly,

644
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,150
even if God himself came,

645
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,520
we wouldn't dare release you randomly.

646
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,720
Are you coming or not?

647
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,040
Come, take that one away.

648
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,030
-My Lord, I’m wronged.
-Get up.

649
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,790
My Lord! I'm innocent! My Lord!

650
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,830
Officer,

651
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,880
I have 20 taels.

652
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,960
Please let me out.

653
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,380
What are you shouting for?

654
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,470
How many times have I told you

655
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,530
to be more prudent?

656
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,350
Yet you're still so blatant.

657
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,880
If this matter

658
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,860
gets to lord's ears,

659
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,320
you'll be in huge trouble.

660
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,730
Next month is Master's birthday banquet.

661
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,110
The money for the opera troupe

662
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,240
hasn't been settled yet.

663
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,070
The small lake in the back garden

664
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,550
still needs a Lake Tai Rock.

665
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,480
Aren't we just

666
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,680
showing our loyalty?

667
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,590
Officer,

668
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,720
I really have the money.

669
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,960
Please let me go.

670
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,480
Important witness,

671
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,680
40 taels.

672
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,340
Do you have 20 taels on you?

673
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,030
If I give them my whole year's income,

674
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,880
what can I take home

675
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,230
to support my mother and siblings?

676
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,490
What can my family eat?

677
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,880
No, I don't have that.

678
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,630
Even if they lock me up forever,
I won't have it.

679
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,680
Come here.

680
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,910
Come closer.

681
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,400
I have something important to tell you.

682
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,640
Come here.

683
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,440
Do you want to get out?

684
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,350
Yes.

685
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,090
What's happening?

686
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,060
What are you doing?

687
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,850
Will this method really work?

688
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,510
The situation has become so serious

689
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,070
that the Rong family
keeps pressuring us to release them.

690
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,270
If we still don't have any solid evidence,

691
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,270
even in front of the Prefect,

692
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,880
I won't be able to explain myself.

693
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,640
Don't worry.

694
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,440
This is an urgent matter.

695
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,770
How can I not be anxious?

696
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,310
Your explanation is ambiguous.

697
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:11,880
I really don't know

698
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,340
how you plan to catch them.

699
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,870
This tea is too astringent and bitter,

700
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,550
which is not good.

701
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,110
Are you even

702
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,070
listening to me?

703
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,210
Young Master.

704
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,440
I've caught them all!

705
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,010
You really caught them?

706
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,740
Bring them in.

707
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,720
Kneel!

708
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,910
My Lord,
I have successfully completed the mission.

709
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,960
Young Master, you ordered me

710
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,880
to work with these officers

711
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,640
to set up a trap.

712
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,400
Sure enough, this Hua took the bait.

713
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,680
He voluntarily offered 20 taels

714
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,280
to escape
from the Government Office quickly.

715
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,960
A low-ranking servant in the Rong family

716
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,560
working hard for a whole year

717
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,390
would earn no more than 20 taels.

718
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,610
After food, clothing, and daily expenses,

719
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,580
there's barely anything left.

720
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,640
Especially for these young servants

721
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,840
who often gather to drink and gamble,

722
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,610
they don't have much money at all.

723
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,510
The government can't afford

724
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,600
to keep so many idle people.

725
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,180
They'd release them sooner or later.

726
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,220
If he is so anxious to offer 20 taels,

727
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,440
he must have something to hide
and is desperate to escape.

728
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,410
Look at the wound on his neck.

729
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,920
Was it done by Hesi?

730
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,670
My Lord, this scoundrel

731
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,640
smashed a water jug

732
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,620
and hid the pieces in his hand,

733
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,480
being determined to kill people.

734
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,330
Hua.

735
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,750
Others already want to take your life.

736
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,010
Are you still going to remain obstinate?

737
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,840
Speak up.

738
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,240
Where did you get the money from?

739
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,160
Talk!

740
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,000
I'll confess.

741
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,340
Lady Yunwan has been sent away.

742
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,750
You should feel more at ease now, Miss.

743
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,030
Let's go back and drink the calming soup,

744
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,160
and then rest early.

745
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,260
You need to take care of yourself too.

746
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,960
Miss Rong! Miss Rong!

747
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,680
You can't just tie me up like this!

748
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,720
I need to see Miss Rong!

749
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,240
Miss Rong!

750
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,920
Miss Rong!

751
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,520
Please spare me!

752
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,790
Please have mercy!

753
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
That night...

754
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,680
That night...

755
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,400
The kitchen's maids were arguing.

756
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,440
Xiu Qiong said she wanted to take a look,

757
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,160
so she asked me
to watch over things for just a moment.

758
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,030
But somehow,

759
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,200
Lady Yunwan suddenly became very agitated.

760
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,480
She spilled the bird's nest soup,

761
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,560
and her clothes got all wet.

762
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,270
I intended to find clean clothes

763
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,600
to help her get changed.

764
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,350
Miss.

765
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,560
I was taken in by the Madam

766
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,590
who found me on the street.

767
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
Since I was six years old,

768
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,440
I've been by your side.

769
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,510
Please consider

770
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,550
all these years I've cared for you

771
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,110
and spare me.

772
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,590
Have mercy on me!

773
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,480
Have mercy on me!

774
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,350
Xiu Qiong.

775
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,550
Xiu Qiong,

776
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,110
please plead for me.

777
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,200
Miss.

778
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,070
It was Xiu Qiong
who left her duty that day.

779
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,550
I'm taking the blame for her.

780
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,070
Miss,

781
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,720
it truly wasn't my fault!

782
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,550
Miss,

783
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,070
please consider

784
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,270
all these years of shared sentiment...

785
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,370
Shared sentiment?

786
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,500
Miss is the master,
and you are the servant.

787
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,310
What kind of "shared sentiment"
do you have with Miss?

788
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,240
If it weren't for Madam and Miss

789
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,100
who took you in back then,

790
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,790
your entire family
would have starved to death.

791
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,510
Forgetting to repay

792
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,310
such a profound
life-saving grace is bad enough,

793
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,810
but you've stirred up trouble recklessly,
shown yourself to be narrow-minded,

794
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,350
acted with duplicity, and betrayed trust.

795
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,960
Every single instance of this,

796
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,660
Miss has witnessed with her own eyes.

797
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,400
Recently, Miss Rong has been busy
with funeral arrangements,

798
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,830
so she had no time to deal with you.

799
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,750
But for what you've done behind her back,

800
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,960
even a hundred deaths would not be enough.

801
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,560
Save yourself some dignity.

802
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,870
Take her away.

803
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Miss, I was wrong, and I understand now.

804
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,830
Miss!

805
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,590
It was Lady Yunxi!

806
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,070
Get up.

807
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,680
Lady Yunxi asked me

808
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,810
to take Lady Yunwan to the back garden.

809
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,220
Miss! Miss!

810
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,980
Mr. Bai finds me clumsy

811
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,140
and rarely asks me to serve him.

812
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,910
So I usually work in the back courtyard,

813
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,510
doing some cleaning chores.

814
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,120
That day before dawn,

815
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,590
I happened to see

816
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,320
Hesi, who always served Mr. He,

817
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,410
secretly burning something.

818
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,590
Before I could ask him anything,

819
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,920
he became very nervous.

820
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,600
He even gave me two taels,

821
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,270
and asked me to keep quiet about it.

822
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,160
I found it more and more suspicious,

823
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,310
so I secretly went back to the courtyard.

824
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,350
I saw with my own eyes

825
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,750
that he hurriedly buried
the half-burned bloody clothes

826
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,060
under a grape tree.

827
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,470
Later I found out

828
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,240
that Mr. Yang had been murdered.

829
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,590
After that, Mr. He approached me,

830
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,200
gave me fifty taels,

831
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,100
and asked me to say
those things.

832
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,880
I was just greedy for a moment.

833
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,480
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

834
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,110
Please be merciful, My Lord.

835
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,350
Those fifty taels

836
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,280
were the price of your conscience.

837
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,750
The taels you received
was ill-gotten from the start.

838
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,000
Your guilty conscience
made you desperate to get out of prison.

839
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,750
Hesi, who was afraid
that you'd spill the truth,

840
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,120
couldn't bear the risk
and decided to kill you.

841
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,760
Hesi,

842
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,110
if you don't
name the mastermind behind this,

843
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,790
you'll be charged

844
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,650
as the murderer of Yang Dingchen.

845
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,270
Can you touch your neck and ask yourself

846
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,440
if you can
bear the punishment of beheading?

847
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,570
It was my Young Master.

848
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,490
Miss,
Mr. He is outside requesting to see you.

849
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,480
Let him in.

850
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:03,880
Yes.

851
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,670
Miss Rong,

852
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,350
I have something urgent to tell you.

853
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,460
It'd be better if we speak in private.

854
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,550
My Young Master ordered me

855
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,310
to burn the bloodstained clothes.

856
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,680
I only burned half of them

857
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,440
because I feared
he might kill me afterward.

858
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,770
I wanted to keep some evidence for myself,

859
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,830
so I buried the remaining pieces

860
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,190
under a tree.

861
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,120
I'll head back to Rong Mansion first.

862
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
Gather your men and follow me later.

863
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,320
What's the rush?

864
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,110
Take him through the back door.

865
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,960
Keep it discreet.

866
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,120
Yes, My Lord. Don't worry.

867
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,480
Gather my men immediately.

868
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,510
I'm heading to the Rong Mansion
to seize the criminal!

869
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,590
During the ceremony,

870
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,510
the incident
with the genuine and counterfeit Tea Bone

871
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,190
has stirred considerable talk
among the common folk.

872
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,150
You should have kept

873
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,610
a close eye on Rong Yunwan.

874
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,400
How could you let her

875
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,730
fall into the murderer's hands so easily?

876
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,159
Unless you had already grown wary of her

877
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,250
and secretly wished her dead.

878
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,290
You deliberately turned a blind eye,

879
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,590
and that was your calculated negligence.

880
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,320
He Xingming!

881
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,719
You're angry?

882
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,550
That's understandable.

883
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,719
Since ancient times, people die for wealth

884
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,989
and birds die for food.

885
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,790
My two half-brothers

886
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,730
hate me too.

887
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,100
They hate me to death.

888
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,030
Moreover, she is the real one,

889
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,880
and you are fake.

890
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,080
How can one mountain
accommodate two tigers?

891
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,170
If one doesn't look out for themselves,
heaven and earth'll destroy them.

892
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,900
Our Rong family
is different from your He family.

893
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,880
The bond between our sisters

894
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,210
is not for you to judge rashly.

895
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,550
Judge rashly?

896
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,960
She was your own flesh-and-blood sister,

897
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,620
born from the same womb as you.

898
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,230
When she died,

899
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,040
you hastily buried her,

900
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,230
not even placing her

901
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,670
in the Rong family cemetery.

902
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,480
Doesn't this show

903
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,610
how guilty you feel?

904
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,280
As for that Yang,

905
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,670
he must have

906
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,110
something bad about you

907
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,910
and forced you to give in,

908
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,400
while trying to form a marriage alliance.

909
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,550
This way,

910
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,510
all the secrets

911
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,760
can be covered up neatly.

912
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Isn't that right?

913
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,280
Rong Shanbao.

914
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,760
You're afraid!

915
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,670
Shut up!

916
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,550
Rong Shanbao.

917
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,360
Rong Shanbao.

918
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,840
If you're willing
to stoop to Yang Dingchen,

919
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,110
why can't you

920
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,880
humble yourself and beg me?

921
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,800
As long as you beg me,

922
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,400
all those rumors outside

923
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,360
will be dealt with

924
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,880
within three days.

925
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,460
I won't let you worry about anything.

926
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,330
Your Rong family and my He family

927
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,750
would become one from now on.

928
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,110
All the tea plantations in the south

929
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,670
would be in our hands,

930
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,260
and that sea route too.

931
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:37,960
Get out!

932
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,760
I've been calculating every move,

933
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,280
and planning meticulously,

934
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,670
but it's all for you!

935
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,030
For me?

936
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,780
You're doing it for profit.

937
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,040
Rong Shanbao.

938
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,230
You know the Rong and He families

939
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,470
have been enemies for years.

940
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,110
You hate me, despise me,

941
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,780
and suspect me.

942
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,400
I know full well

943
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,330
that I shouldn't and can't do this,

944
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,400
but I came anyway.

945
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,840
The first year

946
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,500
when I saw you on the tea route,

947
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,040
I secretly followed you for a long time.

948
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,610
I secretly swore to myself

949
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,670
that I would make

950
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,600
all the mortal enemies in your life

951
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,960
rot in the desert.

952
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,780
But when I saw with my own eyes

953
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,320
you killing bandits and vipers,

954
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,730
and your beautiful hands
were covered in blood,

955
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,030
I was happier for you

956
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,160
than I've ever been for my own success.

957
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,480
All these years,

958
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,920
you've saved countless tea plantations,

959
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,280
and become a deity
in the hearts of tea farmers.

960
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,360
Yet in this family,

961
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,000
you're always misunderstood and framed.

962
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,820
It breaks my heart.

963
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,490
It truly breaks my heart.

964
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,670
I can be your shield.

965
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,960
I can be

966
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,220
the blade in your hand.

967
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,400
I'll shelter you from wind and rain.

968
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,800
I'll charge into battle.

969
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,880
Even if it means killing someone,

970
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,960
I will do it for you.

971
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,670
I can do anything.

972
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,800
If Miss Rong

973
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,330
truly believed your words,

974
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,340
it'd be like keeping a venomous snake,

975
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,600
and she'd have to constantly guard against

976
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,660
you turning on her.

977
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,800
Lu Fusheng, what are you saying?

978
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,010
Miss Rong, Hesi has confessed.

979
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,580
Mr. Yang was killed by Mr. He.

980
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,560
He even revealed
where he buried the bloodstained clothes.

981
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,650
You killed Yang Dingchen?

982
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:54,970
Stop!

983
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,260
Tell them all to leave.

984
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,800
Leave.

985
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,120
Everyone out.

986
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,070
You go out too.

987
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,590
Mr. He.

988
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,670
You're the heir
to the Huqiu Tea of the He family.

989
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,260
Why would you ruin your future

990
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,190
by plotting to kill Yang Dingchen?

991
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,930
Since I was little,
there's never been anything

992
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,060
I wanted that I didn't eventually get.

993
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,630
If you won't be with me,

994
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,960
I'd rather see you shattered to pieces

995
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,890
than give anyone else
the slightest chance with you.

996
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,940
That night,
I snuck into the bridal chamber.

997
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,000
He was already dying from illness.

998
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,930
I merely hastened his journey

999
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,290
by sending him to paradise sooner
to spare him suffering.

1000
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,820
He was supposed to thank me.

1001
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,030
Then why did you kill Rong Yunwan?

1002
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,360
Yang Dingchen
just wouldn't stop pestering me.

1003
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,560
So utterly annoying!

1004
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,960
He died. So what?

1005
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,890
It was supposed
to be completely undetectable,

1006
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,510
but who knew your foolish sister

1007
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,480
would burst in.

1008
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,630
Sister.

1009
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,070
Sister.

1010
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,490
Sister.

1011
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,010
Sister.

1012
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,400
Lady Yunwan? Lady Yunwan?

1013
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,710
Lady Yunwan?

1014
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,710
Someone's there!

1015
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,320
Sister!

1016
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,100
-Mummy!
-Lady Yunwan!

1017
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,760
Lady Yunwan, where are you?

1018
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,660
How did you end up here?

1019
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,400
Someone's here! There's blood!

1020
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,230
This is not a place

1021
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,000
for Lady Yunwan to wander.

1022
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,510
If we're discovered,

1023
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,550
I'll be scolded.

1024
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,030
Hurry!

1025
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,640
Let's go.

1026
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,150
I didn't know if she

1027
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,550
had seen my face clearly.

1028
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,800
To prevent her from ruining things later,

1029
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,130
I naturally had to eliminate this threat.

1030
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,550
Shanbo.

1031
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,630
These two people,

1032
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,370
one was a rogue who clung to you,

1033
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,340
the other was a hindrance in your way,

1034
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,870
and I eliminated them both.

1035
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,760
Haven't I treated you well?

1036
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,110
I'd rather sever ties
with marriage forever

1037
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,070
than bind myself to a man

1038
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,760
who schemes murder

1039
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
and harbors treachery in his heart.

1040
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,280
Then let's die together.

1041
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,280
Wait!

1042
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,710
Don't you want to know

1043
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,480
what Yang Dingchen has

1044
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,280
against me?

1045
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,720
The Rong family's treasure

1046
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,610
is hidden in this room, my room.

1047
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,230
Yang Dingchen

1048
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,690
somehow found out about it

1049
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,960
and used it to blackmail me,

1050
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,290
forcing me to marry him,

1051
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,860
or he'd tell Grandmother.

1052
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,600
There's a passage in that cellar

1053
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,130
that leads to the south pier of Linji.

1054
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,240
I can take you to the pier,

1055
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,970
if you spare my life.

1056
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,810
So Miss Rong is afraid of dying as well.

1057
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,750
How could there be any passage
in this room?

1058
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,460
Aren't you just stalling for time?

1059
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,480
Though Miss Rong is favored by Lady Rong,

1060
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,920
the Rong family

1061
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,370
has more than one daughter.

1062
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,800
To stop others from getting their hands
on the family fortune,

1063
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,230
Miss Rong

1064
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,670
naturally needs to plan ahead.

1065
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,920
She guards a mountain of gold,

1066
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,780
so what's hiding a few treasures?

1067
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:43,740
But Mr. He,

1068
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,020
you must decide quickly.

1069
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,950
If you delay any longer,

1070
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,510
once the government's officials arrive,

1071
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,370
even God won't be able to save you.

1072
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,640
I wouldn't risk my own life.

1073
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,160
Turn the base of that lamp
three times to the right,

1074
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,380
and you'll know I'm telling the truth.

1075
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,730
Mr. He,

1076
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,560
opening this mechanism

1077
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,760
is your only chance of survival.

1078
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,120
With Miss Rong as company,

1079
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,150
even if you lead me to death,

1080
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,700
I won't be lonely
on my way even to the underworld.

1081
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,890
Open the mechanism!

1082
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,970
Quick! Go in and arrest the killer.

1083
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,030
Open it! Hurry!

1084
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,430
[Purple Clay Teapot]

1085
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,550
Purple Clay Teapots are a unique form

1086
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,840
[This pot before us
also holds key insights.]

1087
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,760
of handcrafted ceramic tea ware
originating from China.

1088
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,590
They're made from the purple clay

1089
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,630
for which Yixing
in Jiangsu Province is famous.

1090
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,690
Originating in the Ming Dynasty
and flourishing in the Qing Dynasty,

1091
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,480
they are known for their subdued colors
and non-glossy texture.

1092
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,150
Purple Clay Teapots

1093
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,880
have a double-pore structure,

1094
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,870
with excellent breathability.

1095
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,700
They preserve the aroma of tea
to the fullest extent.

1096
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,480
They're renowned
for retaining the tea flavor

1097
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,110
and preventing discoloration
when storing tea.

1098
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,280
Their bodies also incorporate calligraphy

1099
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,770
and seal carving,
reflecting scholarly elegance.

1100
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:04,760
The teapot crafting techniques
pioneered by Ming Dynasty masters,

1101
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,370
including Gong Chun and Shi Dabin,

1102
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,750
have been

1103
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,100
passed down to this day.

1104
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:13,320
Purple Clay Teapots
are not just practical tea vessels,

1105
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,360
but also treasured works of art

1106
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,840
among scholars and refined individuals.

1107
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,030
They're honored
as the finest teaware in the world.
