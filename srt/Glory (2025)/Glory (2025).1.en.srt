Classic of Mountains and Seas:

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,710
The Great Wilderness West Classic
records

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,310
there was a Kingdom of Women.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,670
The Great Tang Records on the Western
Regions further states

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,240
in the Eastern Kingdom of Women,
women had always been the rulers.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,850
Men were only responsible for
warfare and farming.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,810
Later, it's unclear
in which country or era,

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,170
the Rong Family migrated
and settled in Linji.

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,130
They claimed to be descendants
of the Kingdom of Women.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,890
They cultivated tea plantations
to prosper the land,

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,670
and also opened maritime trade routes.

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,160
For over 400 years,

13
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,920
their wealth overshadowed the realm,

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,250
and their influence
rivaled that of feudal lords.

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,250
Thus, they were known as
the Tea King, the Rong Family.

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,150
Many talented men drawn by their fame,
married into the family,

17
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,680
making it a remarkable spectacle
of the time.

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,150
Let go of me.

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,240
You're nothing but a dog
of the Rong Residence.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,300
What are you doing?

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,610
[The oldest daughter of the Rong family,
Rong Shanbao]

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,600
Miss Rong.

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,789
It's that slut's fault!

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,560
It was that slut who seduced me.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,640
She was the one who tempted me!

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,700
It's all her fault.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,440
Mr. Wang,

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,210
you've overstepped.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,360
Miss Rong!

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:28,900
Miss Rong!

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,480
Miss Rong!

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,190
Miss Rong!

33
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,479
[Butler, Cheng Guanyu]

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,280
Bitch!

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,680
You bitch!

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Why did you seduce me?

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Why did you seduce me?

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,770
Miss Rong.

39
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,300
This bitch seduced me.

40
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,870
I was blinded.

41
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,050
I'll never dare again!

42
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,410
Please forgive me.

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,590
You know,

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,750
I've always been fond of you.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,450
After all, you are skilled in
poetry and writing,

46
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,579
clever, adaptable,

47
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,000
and considerate.

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,350
Miss Rong.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,660
It was them!

50
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,630
They framed me.

51
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,650
They want to take my place!

52
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,350
Miss Rong,

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
we can't let this matter
ruin the affection

54
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,079
we've shared all the time.

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,400
Expel him from the Rong Residence.

56
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,329
Come on.

57
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,560
Don't be afraid.

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,120
Yi,

59
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
our Rong family has over 300 more

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
tea plantations of this scale.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,710
in the south.

62
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,950
The tea farmers we support
are beyond count.

63
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,360
Only this newly opened plantation...

64
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,829
All the precious tea transplanted here

65
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,170
would wither within 3 months.

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,090
It pains me greatly.

67
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,460
I specifically brought you here
at great expense

68
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,460
from Yunnan,

69
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,200
so you could personally nurture the tea
from your homeland.

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,260
I am relying on you.

71
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,430
Miss Rong.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,190
Mr. Wang was chosen for you

73
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,150
by the Old Madam.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,420
I free so sorry.

75
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,210
I submit to your judgment.

76
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,190
He has a low character.

77
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,190
Let's not speak of him.

78
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,070
Since ancient times,
fine swords are gifted to heroes.

79
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,800
From now on, whoever you fancy,

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,520
or whatever treasure you desire,

81
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,430
just tell me.

82
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,810
Take good care of my tea for me.

83
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,190
I will grant

84
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,890
all your wishes.

85

I'm willing to serve you.

86

I would do everything for you.

87

Yi, look.

88
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,540
Tea is our lifeblood.

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,850
Within three years,

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,900
I want every barren mountain here

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
to become a sea of tea.

Are you okay, Ma'am?

101
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,760
Quick, get up first.

102

Miss, that's still a long way off.

108

You can't travel now.

come into my shop for a cup of hot tea

111
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,480
and wait until the storm passes?

112
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,570
Come inside first.

113
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,430
It's freezing cold out here.

114
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,600
You'll freeze

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,390

I'm visiting incognito tonight.

135

I’ve already identified the suspect

136

You solved such a major case
so soon after taking office.

147

A promotion
is surely just around the corner!

148
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,020
It's mainly my fault.

149
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,750
I was negligent in handling the case,

150

to take such a risk alone.

151

yet dare to collude with evildoers

157
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,020
and plot against an imperial official?

158
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,480
How many lives do you have?

159
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,960
What do you mean?

160
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,500
Your were too eager for merit

161
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,000
and carelessly fell into
the trap of thieves.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,630
That's why you lost your life.

163

the great credit
for solving this major case

165

to register.

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,690
Did you all hear that?

192
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,440
Lord Lu is sending you home.

193
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,580
Thank you, My Lord!

194
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,960
For those with no family to claim them,

195
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,220
arrange temporary
shelter at the County Office first.

196
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,120
As for the woman who voluntarily
served as bait tonight,

197
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,280
reward her with five taels of silver.

198
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,810
Yes, sir!

199
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,510
We can finally go home.

200
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,750
Yes, we can go now.

201
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,510
Let's go.

202
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,270
Be careful.

203
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,980
My Lord.

204
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,200
My Lord.

205
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,430
Another cellar has been discovered.

206
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,000
Dead bodies... piled to the top.

207
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,000
Corpse mud?

208
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,200
It's... it's corpse mud.

209
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,100
Immediately dispatch more personnel.

210
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,030
Gather all the county's coroners.

211
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,090
I will interrogate through the night.

212
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,620
Yes, sir!

213
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,750
I beg Your Lord
to dismiss your attendants.

214
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,950
I have confidential matters to report.

215
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,890
Let's go.

216
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,580
I've run rampant in Chunning for 20 years.

217
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,200
Every county magistrate

218
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,120
has treated me

219
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,650
with courtesy and respect.

220
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,440
Lord Lu,
you endured ten years of hard study

221
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,510
to earn your rank and title.
It wasn't easy.

222
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,550
Take my advice:

223
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,109
don't dig your own grave

224
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,480
and ruin your future.

225
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,240
Release me now.

226
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,119
It'll be more convenient for both of us.

227
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,500
He was recommended

228
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,900
by Prefect Xu of Linji.

229
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,310
But with corpses piled like mountains,

230
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,510
if I let you go,

231
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,000
how can I explain myself to the Prefect?

232
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,930
That's easy.

233
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,200
He has told you

234
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,200
that my sister is Lord Xu's

235
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,880
most beloved concubine.

236
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,130
To be honest,

237
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,750
even if you arrest me,

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,510
later you'll have to release me unharmed

239
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,720
and send me back anyway.

240
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,830
Why not just release me now?

241
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,240
Later, I'll have a word
with my brother-in-law,

242
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,000
Lord Xu.

243
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,890
I'll put in a good word for you.

244
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,550
Reporting!

245
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,170
How dare you, Liu Ben!

246
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,970
You dare to assassinate Lord Lu!

247
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,880
-My Lord!
-My Lord!

248
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,040
Liu Ben seized a knife
with malicious intent.

249
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,720
Fortunately, Lord Lu is blessed

250
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,830
and didn't fall into his trap.

251
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,630
He has been executed on the spot.

252
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,720
We are late.

253
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,280
Sorry to let you be frightened.

254
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,570
Carry the body back to the County Office.

255
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,020
Hang it for public display for 3 days.

256
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,640
I want everyone in Chunning County

257
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,900
to see the fate of those

258
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,930
who collude with bandits

259
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,200
and prey upon the people.

260
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,560
Yes, sir!

261
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,510
Hurry up and support him!

262
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Serves him right!

263
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,500
Instant retribution!

264
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,540
[Rong Residence]

265
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,270
It's all Lu's fault.

266
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,860
If he hadn't interfered,

267
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,590
you would have lured
the snake out of the hole,

268
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,240
and captured the mastermind

269
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,750
behind the abduction

270
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,750
of the mountain tea-picking girls.

271
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,900
This collusion between officials
and merchants has a long history.

272
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,880
If they could truly follow
this trail

273
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,340
and investigate further,

274
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,790
it might not be a bad thing

275
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,310
for the people.

276
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,840
Look into this newly arrived
Lord Lu.

277
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,380
Okay.

278
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,030
Miss Rong,

279
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,190
the wheel tracks leading down the mountain

280
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,520
had been tampered with.

281
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,010
Time to settle accounts.

282
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,330
Did you see clearly? She's really back?

283
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,330
Hurry up, please.

284
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,760
[Young Master of the Rong family,
Rong Shanchang]

285
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,100
Miss Rong.

286
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,330
You're back already?

287
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,880
But...

288
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,600
Is the day not yet upon us?

289
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,640
I had just descended Mount Guzhu

290
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,410
when I encountered a landslide.

291
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,570
Unfortunately, I then ran into bandits
robbing people.

292
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,770
Not only did they
rob the wild tea seeds,

293
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,290
they also tried to abduct
and sell my maidservants.

294
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,220
So you don't know?

295
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,790
You encountered a landslide on your way?

296
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,550
How could you also have run into bandits?

297
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,200
Did you get hurt?

298
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,050
Sister.

299
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,310
It was the Young Master

300
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,720
who embezzled silver from the account.

301
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,750
Fearing the truth would come out
during the audit in 7 days,

302
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,480
and hearing that

303
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,440
you had entered Mount Guzhu
to seek wild tea plants,

304
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,400
he planned to delay you

305
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,590
a couple of days on the road,

306
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,410
so he'd have time
to make up the shortfall elsewhere.

307
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,830
But... he only dared to
tamper with the wheel tracks!

308
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,690
You scoundrel!

309
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,590
Who told you to frame me?

310
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,190
Would I harm my elder sister?

311
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,960
Miss Rong, please see clearly!

312
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,070
Miss Rong is wise.

313
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,240
We truly tried to dissuade him!

314
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,200
But Young Master didn't listen.

315
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,170
Yes. Yes.

316
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,350
How would we dare to kill people?

317
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,300
Shut up!

318
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,840
Get up!

319
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,370
I am the eldest son of the main branch.

320
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:18,810
Let's go.

321
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,160
Who dares to touch me?

322
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,220
Just try.

323
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,030
You may leave now.

324
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,860
My dear sister,

325
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,720
it's just a few

326
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,920
lowly dogs that died.

327
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:33,890
Tomorrow,

328
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,780
I'll get you a few better ones.

329
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,830
Okay?

330
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,880
You treated human life
as worthless grass,

331
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,010
being so heartless.

332
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,980
Just a few servants.

333
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
You were blinded by profit and insatiable,

334
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,120
plotting against superiors,
showing no respect for elders.

335
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,270
Such injustice!

336
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,680
I swear to the heavens,

337
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,350
I only tampered with the wheel tracks!

338
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,080
What landslide and bandits...

339
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,960
Even if you lent me
a hundred times the courage,

340
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,030
I wouldn't dare!

341
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,830
You should be glad
you only tampered with the wheel tracks.

342
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,880
Otherwise,

343
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,970
by this time next year,
the weeds on your grave

344
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,100
might be 3 feet high.

345
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,780
Kneel outside the ancestral hall
for 7 days.

346
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,440
No one is to bring him any food.

347
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,530
My dear brother, get up please.

348
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,590
The ground is cold.

349
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,780
Every one looks down on me!

350
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,960
You know my luck in this life

351
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,550
has never been good...

352
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,270
Don't say that again.

353
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,670
Although we are family,

354
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:47,750
there is closeness and distance.

[The third daughter of the Rong family,
Rong Yun'e]

356
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,240
No one can compare to the one

357
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,790
who is the very apple of Grandma's eye.

358
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,750
Only after Father pleaded repeatedly

359
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,440
could we follow her

360
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,970
in using
the generational name character.

361
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,970
She is the moon in the clouds,

362
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,550
but you are the mud underfoot.

363
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,550
Just bear with it.

364
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,270
Coward!

365
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,000
The rain on the eaves' plantains
won't kill you.

366
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,270
All of you are afraid of her,

367
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,070
but I'm not.

368
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,890
Sooner or later...

Greetings, Ms. Yan.

370

Lady Rong has already given the order:

371
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,780
Miss Rong's status is exalted.

372
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,230
Anyone who dares to
challenge her authority,

373
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:17,780
disregarding rank and propriety,

[Butler, Yan Jingyi]

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,000
Their life or death
will no longer be our concern.

377
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,270
As for those in this courtyard

378
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,700
who plot misconduct
or know but fail to report it,

379
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,230
give them 80 heavy strokes.

380
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,680
Then, deliver them
to the County Office.

381
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,250
As for you, Young Master,

382
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,650
since Miss Rong has already
decided your punishment,

383
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,510
you can just go kneel

384
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,640
outside the ancestral hall yourself.

385
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,720
[Governor's Office]

386
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,110
A mere county magistrate

387
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,110
dares to execute my wife's brother?

388
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,160
Your Excellency,

389
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,890
you must uphold justice for me!

390
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,590
Your Excellency, I'm
the Chunning Magistrate,

391
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,720
Lu Jianglai, request an audience now.

392
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,770
[Governor, Jiang Yiqian]

393
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,410
Greetings, Your Excellency.

394
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,230
Lord Xu, you're here, too.

395
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,270
[Prefect, Xu Song]

396
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,150
Have you

397
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,770
received the letter so soon?

398
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,610
It's all that damned Liu Ben's fault!

399
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,890
Having received your
great kindness and favor,

400
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,160
he should have been
diligent and conscientious,

401
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,920
striving in his duties.

402
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,070
Yet he betrayed that kindness,

403
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,880
forgot righteousness,
acted wildly and irrationally,

404
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,860
and slandered you
as the chief bandit!

405
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,720
He also said...

406
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,650
What did he say?

407
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,200
I dare not say it.

408
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,790
Tell me.

409
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,680
He said last year,

410
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,550
he presented you with a pair of

411
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,160
priceless cricket pots,

412
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,310
30 jars of Huadiao wine,

413
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,710
10 kilos of Longjing tea.

414
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,700
For your concubine's birthday,

415
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,220
he gave 500 taels in silver

416
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,830
and sent you a theater troupe
for 3 days.

417
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,000
Nonsense!

418
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,000
Yes.

419
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,550
I also angrily rebuked him:

420
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,590
"Lord Xu has noble character

421
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,960
and is extremely strict with
his subordinates."

422
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,070
Last time I visited the Xu residence,

423
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,160
you didn't even accept
a single tael's worth of gifts

424
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,020
or gatekeeper's tips!

425
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,160
How could you possibly
covet his petty offerings?

426
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,790
But he, on the contrary,

427
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,160
started shouting even louder!

428
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
He said half of Liujia Village

429
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,070
works in the County Office,

430
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,920
all relying on

431
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,740
Lord Xu's numerous promotions and support!

432
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,600
He also said...

433
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,920
you had taken a fancy

434
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,440
to the daughter of retired Censor Fang

435
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,960
and wanted to kidnap her
to be your concubine!

436
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,160
Nonsense!

437
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,240
l was precisely acting with urgency

438
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,790
for your concerns.

439
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,830
I feared that in open court,
his foul words

440
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,070
would slander your
clean reputation.

441
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,270
Once it spread publicly,

442
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,070
where would official dignity remain?

443
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,270
That's why it was a last resort

444
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,180
to execute him on the spot.

445
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,110
I believe you will surely forgive me.

446
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:38,830
You...

447
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,530
I'be been impudent.

448
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,660
I beg Your Excellency's forgiveness.

449
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,480
I will return right away
and investigate strictly.

450
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,920
If there truly is someone spreading rumors

451
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,380
and confusing the public,

452
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,680
l will surely

453
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,210
dismember his bones alive!

454
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,350
Alright.

455
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,160
I know.

456
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,680
You may leave.

457
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,550
I shall take my leave.

458
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,750
Your Excellency,

459
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,790
Zhang's Tea Shop

460
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,550
has already yielded countless skeletons.

461
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,680
Without severe punishment,
it'll be hard to appease public anger.

462
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,400
I think...

463
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,340
This is not why

464
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,950
I have called for you.

465
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,320
This Chunhua Ge Tie...

466
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,440
I've looked through it many times.

467
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,510
I really

468
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,890
can't put it down.

469
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,110
But now,

470
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,510
I should return it to its owner.

471
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:36,960
[Volume VIII of the Chunhua Ge Tie]

472
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,750
Take it back.

473
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,510
This is merely a copy

474
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,840
I made on a whim,
practicing my skills.

475
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,420
I fear it would make people laugh.

476
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,890
It's my pleasure

477
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
that Your Excellency
deigns to keep it for enjoyment.

478
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,330
Really? I didn't tell

479
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,190
this is a copy.

480
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,950
I couldn't tell at all.

481
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,060
The younger generation is formidable,

482
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,170
truly formidable.

483
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,250
However, as an official,

484
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,150
you should also remember

485
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,830
an old saying in officialdom:

486
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,190
"For those
who do not wish for great darkness,

487
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,520
they must not be too stubbornly upright."

488
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,750
Everyone will be someone's successor,

489
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,790
and everyone also
was someone's predecessor.

490
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,680
When doing things,
always leave a bit of leeway,

491
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,810
and be more considerate of the dignity

492
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,660
of superiors and colleagues.

493
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,030
As the saying goes,

494
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,400
"Harmony up and down, all in unity,"

495
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,910
then everyone can do their work well.

496
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,150
Thank you for your instruction,
Your Excellency.

497
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,300
I will surely remember it in my heart.

498
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,960
[Governor's Office]

499
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,420
My Lord,

500
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,060
where are we going next?

501
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,550
Back to the residence.

502
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,250
What an old fox.

503
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,560
Relying on Minister Xu
in the capital

504
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,760
as his examiner,

505
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,350
and the Emperor favoring his writings,

506
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,790
how arrogantly and presumptuously

507
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,830
he has acted!

508
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,480
He completely disregards me at all.

509
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,770
A monkey sent from the capital

510
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,810
still can't jump out
of the palm of

511
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,890
your hand.

512
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,400
Haven't you recently

513
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,620
been troubled by
the old case of Wei family,

514
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,400
urgently seeking capable officials

515
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,640
to handle it?

516
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,320
Well now,

517
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,360
he's the perfect candidate
delivered to you.

518
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,000
Raise the sedan!

519
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,420
[Madam Rong]

520

[Cousin of the Rong family,
Shen Xiangling]

521

With sallow-dark face
and short eyebrows,

522
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,740
how dare you
present yourself here to apply!

523
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,270
Truly laughable!

524
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Miss Rong is back.

525
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,730
Greetings, Miss Rong.

526
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,110
All right, we've seen them now.

527
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,640
All of you may leave.

528
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,830
Bao, come here.

529
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,870
Sisters having fun together
but didn't call me?

530
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Yunxi was afraid
you wouldn't make it in time,

531
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,560
so she said
she'd screen them for you first.

532
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,690
[The second daughter of the Rong family,
Rong Yunxi]

533
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,460
What a rich, mellow tea fragrance.

534
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,140
[The fifth daughter of the Rong family,
Rong Yunshu]

535
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,350
Thank you, Yunxi.

536
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,030
What a pity.

537
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,160
The quality of those just now

538
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,690
was all beyond redemption.

539
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,350
Truly a waste of effort.

540
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,050
Each family has sent over candidates.

541
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,750
They'll arrive in Linji in a few days.

542
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,550
There's no rush to make a choice.

543
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,920
How was your trip?

544
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,150
Thank you for your concern, Grandmother.

545
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,370
We encountered a landslide
on our way back,

546
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,500
and lost two guards.

547
00:31:59,440 --> 00:31:59,960
Really?

548
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,720
Miss Rong said

549
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,890
the best Zisun Tea

550
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,240
is on Mount Guzhu.

551
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,030
She also mentioned
that deep in the forest,

552
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,200
there are hundred-year-old
wild mother tea trees.

553
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,350
Grandmother placed great hopes
on your trip.

554
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,840
She was just telling us earlier

555
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,270
how she hoped for your early return,

556
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,750
wishing for guests
at the New Year tea party

557
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,790
to taste

558
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,070
the wild Zisun Tea.

559
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,580
What should we do now?

560
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,270
Yunshu.

561
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,680
The most important thing

562
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,100
is Miss Rong safe return.

563
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,940
The family of the deceased and injured

564
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,840
should also be properly comforted.

565
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,570
With the New Year approaching,

566
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,730
we must avoid any incidents.

567
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,300
No wonder everyone praises
for your virtue.

568
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,160
Truly accustomed to being the good person,

569
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,680
being so considerate.

570
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,140
We could never compare.

571
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,400
But Mount Guzhu

572
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,920
has always been peaceful.

573
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,490
Who knows if someone

574
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,720
secretly tracked her movements,

575
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,980
intentionally targeting the Rong family?

576
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,940
In my opinion,

577
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,920
comforting the families
of the deceased is important,

578
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,780
but uncovering the source of this trouble

579
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,910
is the most crucial.

580
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,470
Exactly!

581
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,510
That mountain path didn't collapse

582
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,510
earlier or later,

583
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,750
but just as Shanbao's carriage passed,

584
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,480
with a rumble, it collapsed.

585
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,400
You must be careful.

586
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,230
You'd better go to the temple

587
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,560
to change your fortune.

588
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,710
[The fourth daughter of the Rong family, Rong Yunyin]

589
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,000
Greetings, Grandmother.

590
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,090
Nice to meet you.

591
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,960
No wonder that maid fanning

592
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
looked familiar earlier.

593
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,080
So it was you
deliberately dressed like that

594
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,490
to play a trick.

595
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,350
Only you could think of that.

596
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,550
Making them drink scalding tea earlier

597
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,180
was also your idea, wasn't it?

598
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,250
Grandmother.

599
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,310
I just want to

600
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,650
share Shanbao's burden,

601
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,250
afraid someone
might slip through unnoticed.

602
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,450
You, always playing tricks on people.

603
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,960
What can I do with you?

604
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,100
Grandmother.

605
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,330
Scalding tea is very troublesome.

606
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,590
Yunxi

607
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,750
insisted on
drying it over charcoal fire herself

608
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,750
and got a huge scar on her right hand.

609
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,810
Although I couldn't help much,

610
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,280
serving tea personally

611
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,139
is my way of showing filial piety.

612
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,800
Your hand is scalded?

613
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,310
It's nothing serious.

614
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,889
Yunyin, young but shrewd,

615
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,830
loves to boast.

616
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,679
Don't talk nonsense
in front of Grandmother.

617
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,139
Grandmother,

618
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,300
do you think my tea brewing skills

619
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,440
are up to par?

620
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,820
During the new tea picking season
this year,

621
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,670
let me go to the tea plantation too,

622
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,230
alright?

623
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,440
Please?

624
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,230
Alright.

625
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
Lapsang Souchong is hard to come by.

626
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,930
To bring out its fragrance,

627
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,800
one must not only practice diligently

628
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,660
but also have heaven's blessing.

629
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,800
Using tea leaves picked on a rainy day,

630
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,670
even the most fragrant tea
will retain astringency.

631
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,330
What a pity.

632
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,980
Xiuqiong, come in.

633
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,390
On this trip to Mount Guzhu,

634
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,350
I was fortunate to find 20 wild tea trees

635
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,840
in a remote valley.

636
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,400
I also obtained a packet of

637
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:13,960
the finest wild Zisun Tea

638
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,620
from the mountain villagers,

639
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,540
kept close to my body inside my garment.

640
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,000
I am fortunate
not to have failed my mission.

641
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,670
Excellent tea.

642
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,550
Excellent tea.

643
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,440
Yunyin,

644
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,510
take the remaining tea leaves

645
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,590
to my room later.

646
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,280
Let's see how to handle them.

647
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,340
How to handle them?

648
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,110
We can only discard them.

649
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,000
We're not like some one,

650
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,260
born with a 'tea bone,'

651
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,350
able to identify hundreds of teas,

652
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,630
even resurrect

653
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,760
withered tea trees.

654
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,320
They can also distinguish

655
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,720
good tea leaves' grades.

656
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,250
Better save the effort.

657
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,930
What are you talking about?

658
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Shanbao is your sibling,

659
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,250
who barely escaped death to return.

660
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,460
Instead of saying a few comforting words,

661
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,440
you're making insinuations

662
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
with pointed remarks.

663
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,040
Did she owe you in a past life?

664
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,840
Xiangling, are you born with six fingers?

665
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,670
Why are you intervening in
others' affairs?

666
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,030
Our Rong family doesn't serve

667
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,510
pickled vegetables daily.

668
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,510
Why meddle upon opening your mouth?

669
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,480
Yunxi.

670
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,510
I have some Mengding Ganlu Tea

671
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,530
Grandmother rewarded me with.

672
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,730
Come to my place for tea.

673
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,260
Let's go.

674
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,960
Miss Rong, Miss Shen...

675
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,550
I...

676
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,920
Yunshu, go rest early.

677
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,510
Yes.

678
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,990
Born from the same mother as you,

679
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,440
yet siding with

680
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,430
the second and third branches,

681
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,150
constantly undermining you
to please outsiders.

682
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,150
Truly possessed.

683
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,130
Don't I still have you who cares for me?

684
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:21,820
Let's go.

685
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,090
I'll tell you about my journey.

686
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,450
No time for that now.

687
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,230
Guess why

688
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,490
those door-god-like guards

689
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,490
stayed all night?

690
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,710
Madam.

691
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
The people around the Young Master

692
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,630
have been strictly investigated.

693
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,630
The landslide...

694
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,360
He...

695
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,990
doesn't have that capability.

696
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,600
The broken wheel tracks were man-made,

697
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,030
and the landslide was an accident.

698
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,690
But as for the gang of bandits,

699
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,070
should we continue investigating?

700
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,000
Who did it doesn't matter.

701
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,910
What matters is to

702
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,530
see how she handles it.

703
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,280
In moments of crisis and danger,

704
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,990
knowing how to adapt to circumstances

705
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,250
and draw out the enemy.

706
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,510
That shows my years of teaching
weren't in vain.

707
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,970
But as the old saying goes,

708
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,270
"Kindness does not command soldiers."

709
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,320
To become the head of the Rong family,

710
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,400
she still has much to learn.

711
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,630
Miss, be careful.

712
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,290
You're upset,

713
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,020
why take it out on Yunshu
with such strange anger?

714
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,150
Don't blame Yunyin.

715
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,500
It was my own carelessness,

716
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,110
not realizing the tea leaves were poor.

717
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,890
Rain-picked ones
are easy to identify anyway.

718
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,450
How can it be your fault?

719
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,320
It's still because my eyes are no good,

720
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,040
I can only rely on
smell and touch to tell,

721
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,150
ultimately delaying Yunxi's matters.

722
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,400
Doesn't Rong Shanbao

723
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,030
also just need a sniff
to tell good from bad?

724
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,800
You little blind one,

725
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,060
getting delicate now!

726
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,760
After all,

727
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
it's all because that gang of robbers
was too greedy.

728
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
We had them try to steal the tea seeds

729
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,200
to make Rong Shanbao lose face.

730
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,550
Who knew after taking so much gold,

731
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,280
they still weren't satisfied,

732
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,010
daring to kill and plunder,

733
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,650
causing such a huge disaster!

734
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,130
Shut up!

735
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,150
Didn't we just manage

736
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,150
to cover it up?

737
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,100
Don't mention this matter again.

738
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,550
Each family

739
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,050
has sent
marriage horoscopes.

740
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,580
Yunxi, take a look quickly,

741
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,040
choose a good one early.

742
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,040
Yunyin, don't forget

743
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,230
the best one
is surely reserved

744
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,000
by Grandmother for Shanbao.

745
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,050
Since ancient times, men die for wealth,

746
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,310
and birds die for food.

747
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,800
The Rong family

748
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,530
wants the most excellent heir;

749
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,630
others, likewise,

750
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,890
come for the benefits.

751
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,200
In the end,

752
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,850
what they compete for is not the beauties,

753
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,670
but the tea mountains and silver seas,

754
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,600
and even the Tea King, Rong Family.

755
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,540
[Chunning County Government]

756
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,960
Oh no!

757
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,400
That Xu Song

758
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,440
actually wants to make you die!

759
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,970
It's just a wife-murder case,

760
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,090
how can it endanger my live?

761
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,130
You don't know the severity of this case.

762
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,730
I just checked the old files.

763
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,380
Wei Kejian and his wife, Madam Yang,

764
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,510
were always at odds.

765
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,700
On the 15th day of the first lunar month,

766
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,030
the two had an argument.

767
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,890
What to do?

768
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,190
Madam Yang angrily left home.

769
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,790
Wei Kejian searched in vain

770
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,900
and accused the Yang family
of hiding his wife.

771
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,160
The Yang family counter-accused Wei Kejian

772
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,220
of beating his wife to death.

773
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:57,900
It's them!

774
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,090
They hid my wife!

775
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,970
With no corpse of Madam Yang found,

776
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,610
Wei Kejian was acquitted and released.

777
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,850
But the Wei and Yang families

778
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,780
became enemies.

779
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,170
Clansmen had several armed clashes,

780
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,430
with many casualties.

781
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,960
In March the following year,

782
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,570
when a beggar
was digging for sweet potatoes,

783
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,570
he unearthed an unidentified body.

784
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,820
Verified by the coroner
using the 'drip bone' method

785
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,700
and identified by the Yang family
through personal effects,

786
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,740
it was indeed the skeleton

787
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,600
of Madam Yang,
missing for a year.

788
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,860
I'm wronged!

789
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,800
Wei Kejian was imprisoned.

790
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,830
It should have ended there.

791
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,260
Why did it later become a doubtful case?

792
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,050
The problem lay with
the presiding judge

793
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,530
at the time, Fan Wende.

794
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,010
Due to sudden heavy rain,

795
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,820
busy repairing collapsed houses,

796
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,820
he delayed the autopsy by three days.

797
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,010
The first examination said female;

798
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,590
another official sent for re-examination,

799
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,050
actually said it was a man.

800
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,220
The bones couldn't even determine gender?

801
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,700
There weren't bones.

802
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,860
Days of heavy rain washed away everything,

803
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,610
leaving only a few

804
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,210
incomplete bone fragments.

805
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,650
Besides jewelry and old belongings,

806
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,250
there was no other evidence.

807
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,100
The Wei family was bankrupted
by the lawsuit.

808
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,010
Wei Kejian even went mad in prison.

809
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,090
The Wei clansmen kept appealing,

810
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,490
cries of injustice lasting for years.

811
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,650
His Majesty issued an edict for a retrial.

812
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,770
However, officials handling the retrial

813
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,170
at best lost their posts,

814
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,520
at worst paid with
their lives and fortunes.

815
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,070
Several are still imprisoned to this day.

816
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,350
[Injustice]

817
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,650
Everyone in officialdom avoids it.

818
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,420
Prefect Xu

819
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,750
is clearly using public office
for private revenge!

820
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,230
Tomorrow morning,

821
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,090
summon everyone involved to court.

822
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,450
I will interrogate them personally.

823
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,490
No way.

824
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,310
The Wei family insists

825
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,610
that on the day of the incident,

826
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,710
Madam Yang attended a banquet
at the Rong family,

827
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,130
to celebrate the Lady Rong's birthday.

828
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,450
She enjoyed lanterns and wine
until night before returning.

829
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,010
They also said she pretended
to attend the banquet but really fled.

830
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,700
Later, she vanished without a trace.

831
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,450
She must have gone to the Rong family.

832
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,980
Then summon the Rong family
for questioning!

833
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,090
It's the number one
tea family in Jiangnan,

834
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,550
the Tea King, Rong family.

835
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,250
How can the government easily summon them?

836
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,850
We'll act on both fronts.

837
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,380
Send someone to Suzhou overnight

838
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,710
to invite Coroner Chen.

839
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,690
He served in the Ministry of Justice
for 60 years.

840
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:02,940
Even if it's just a few bone fragments,

841
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,900
he can examine them.

842
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,160
Also take my name card,

843
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,940
invite Lady Rong as well.

844
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,130
If she wouldn't like to come,

845
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,500
then bring her by force.

846
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,400
[Zisun Tea]

847
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,340
Grandmother placed great hopes
on your trip.

848
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,700
She hoped for your early return,

849
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,170
wishing for guests
at the New Year tea party

850
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,220
to taste

851
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,490
the wild Zisun Tea.

852
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:04,780
Zisun Tea,

853
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,940
originates from
Mount Guzhu in Changxing, Zhejiang.

854
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,610
Discovered in the Tang Dynasty
by the Tea Sage Lu Yu

855
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,090
and recommended as tribute tea,

856
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,130
it was presented as tribute
for nearly 1,000 years.

857
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,050
Because its color is purplish
and its shape resembles bamboo shoots,

858
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:15,300
it is named Zisun Tea.

859
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,970
Lu Yu wrote in The Classic of Tea:

860
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,700
"Purple is superior, green is secondary;

861
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,570
shoot is superior, bud is secondary."

862
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,860
He classified it as top-grade tea,

863
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,020
giving it detailed study and records.

864
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,330
Literary figures like Du Mu, Bai Juyi,

865
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,730
and Su Shi

866
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,170
often praised it in poems and writings,

867
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,510
leaving a legacy for eternity.

868
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,220
Brewing Zisun Tea
with Jinsha spring water

869
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,970
from Mount Guzhu

870
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,730
results in an emerald green color,
orchid fragrance,

871
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,790
sweet taste,
refreshing the mouth, with a rich flavor.

872
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:39,950
A cup of Zisun Tea

873
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,900
still carries the fragrance
of a thousand years.

874
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,060
Its production technique
is a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage,

875
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,740
and an important component of

876
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,200
China's traditional tea-making techniques

877
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,350
and related customs.
