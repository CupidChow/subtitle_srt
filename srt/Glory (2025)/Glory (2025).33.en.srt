1
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,660
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,920
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,870
Father, in all my years

4
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,120
I have never

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,720
suffered such humiliation.

6
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,430
After all, I am

7
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,000
your daughter, Father.

8
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,509
I was personally

9
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,110
ennobled as
Princess Jinxiang by the Emperor.

10
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,640
She's merely a merchant's daughter,

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,370
yet she dares to be so arrogant.

12
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,789
You've made

13
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,870
tremendous contributions to the court.

14
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,350
You are the Emperor's
most trusted minister.

15
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,040
If your son wanted a wife,

16
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,790
any imperial princess or
daughter of the great houses

17
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,680
would have been his for the choosing.

18
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
But instead,

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,560
he rejected them all

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
and chose this demoness.

21
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,740
He nearly struck his own cousin.

22
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,840
If you won't stand up for me,

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,400
is it because you fear

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,730
that imperial jade seal

25
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,110
or that insolent woman?

26
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,940
Enough!

27
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,890
Father, you no longer care for me.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,910
You allow outsiders to bully me,

29
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,690
and you will not even stand up for me.

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,020
I was widowed at the age of seventeen.

31
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,570
Once,

32
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,290
Father, you cared for me.

33
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,090
But now,

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,820
even you no longer show me any affection.

35
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,079
Then what's the point

36
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,430
of my living?

37
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,040
I might as well die.

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,880
I know you have been wronged.

39
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,120
You're quite fond of my

40
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,190
ruby-inlaid saber set, aren't you?

41
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,770
I'll give it to you.

42
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,400
I don't want it.

43
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,230
Stop this nonsense!

44
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,190
I know everything about

45
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,770
what happened at Hanyu Courtyard today.

46
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,290
It was your insolent words

47
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,400
that provoked her

48
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,960
to bring out the imperial jade seal.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,280
You brought this humiliation
upon yourself.

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,340
Do you understand?

51
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,120
Founding Emperor's decree

52
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,000
cannot be defied even by

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
the present Emperor.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,600
She spared your life

55
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,140
out of respect for me.

56
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,840
Yingchuan, remember this.

57
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,590
This piece must be held
firmly in your grasp.

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,910
Whether it bends or stands straight,

59
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,680
resists or submits,

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,480
so long as it serves its purpose.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,850
Keep her under control,

62
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,560
and Jianglai will eventually submit.

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,640
I warn you.

64
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,880
Don't ruin my plans.

65
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,420
Otherwise, even though
you are my daughter,

66
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,630
I will not spare you.

67
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,710
Father.

68
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,910
Would it not invite ridicule

69
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,710
to bring such an unfilial

70
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,320
and unvirtuous woman into our family?

71
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,070
It's just women's

72
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,390
petty squabbles.

73
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,470
How significant could it be?

74
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,180
Once she marries Jianglai,

75
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,020
the jade seal will belong
to Jianglai's family.

76
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,030
Whose rules she will follow

77
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,650
will become clear with time.

78
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,210
How could a mere fragile woman

79
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,310
possibly stand against

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,920
the ways of this world?

81
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,920
So naive.

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,360
Father.

83
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,880
Are you truly going to
grant the title to…?

84
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,800
I'm only

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
worried about Mother's health.

86
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,480
She hasn't been well lately.

87
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,670
After being angered by that woman,

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,720
she couldn't even get out of bed.

89
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,430
Is that so?

90
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,870
She's ill again?

91
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,180
[Baoshi Hall]

92
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,390
Come, follow me to Fuping Pavilion.

93
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,360
[Fuping Pavilion]

94
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,280
Master Shuyu.

95
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
His Highness has spoken.

96
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,740
The Xue family has few descendants.

97
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,140
You two are his only sons.

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,540
As brothers,

99
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,040
you should stand united

100
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,600
and support each other,

101
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,680
and together

102
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
uphold the family honor.

103
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,740
I don't understand.

104
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,810
Father's words

105
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,880
have left me confused.

106
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
What have I done wrong

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,420
that he would punish me
by making me kneel facing north?

108
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,850
Please enlighten me, Steward Xue.

109
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,240
His Highness is firmly resolved

110
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,900
to have Master Jianglai
formally reinstated into the family.

111
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,590
Yet you are unwilling and
have obstructed it at every turn,

112
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,680
attempting to drive Miss Rong away

113
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,120
and expel Master Jianglai.

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,720
That would

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,920
only be possible

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,780
if the impossible were to happen.

117
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,310
The Duke's mind is made up.

118
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,430
Once he's decided on something,

119
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,630
it cannot be changed.

120
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,040
If you insist on stirring up

121
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,240
discord between you two in front of him,

122
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,240
how could he possibly spare you?

123
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
My ailment is in my legs.

124
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,240
I can barely walk

125
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,320
and am ashamed to be seen.

126
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,070
Let alone visiting Mother
at Hanyu Courtyard,

127
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,530
I rarely even step outside

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,300
this Fuping Pavilion.

129
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,680
Mother has always valued rules above all.

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,950
She took it upon herself
to discipline Miss Rong

131
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,810
for her temperament and conduct.

132
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,430
What does that have to do with me?

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,560
You don't often visit the Hanyu Courtyard,

134
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,600
but Princess Jinxiang

135
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,390
comes to

136
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,250
the Fuping Pavilion frequently.

137
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,080
Father cherishes his precious daughter,

138
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,500
yet the consequences

139
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,510
of Xue Yingchuan's pride and arrogance

140
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,040
must be borne by me as well.

141
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,159
Does Father truly believe

142
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
that I incited her to cause trouble,

143
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,130
or that I could presume

144
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,470
to control Mother's words and deeds?

145
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,630
He surely holds me

146
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,890
in far too high regard.

147
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,430
Disorder in the household

148
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,890
often breeds misfortune.

149
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,480
Master Shuyu.

150
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,060
His Highness has instructed you

151
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,610
to kneel here until cockcrow.

152
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,010
Please stop complaining

153
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,370
and save your strength.

154
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,560
Master Shuyu is already injured

155
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,640
and shouldn't kneel for long.

156
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,070
Might it be possible…

157
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,600
Get lost!

158
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,420
With Master Shuyu punished in this way,

159
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,120
I do not know how many

160
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,320
in the household will end up suffering.

161
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,030
Master Shuyu!

162
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,670
Master Shuyu.

163
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,670
Brother.

164
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,910
How did you know it was me?

165
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,080
I heard your footsteps.

166
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,590
You're lying.

167
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,960
When I came in,

168
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,910
you were lost in thought.

169
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,960
Weren't you going to visit Master Shuyu?

170
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,090
Why have you come back looking so glum?

171
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,270
You are brothers,

172
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,550
bound by blood,

173
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,330
yet he did not embrace you in tears

174
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,110
nor pour out his heart to you.

175
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,870
Instead, he treated you like a guest,

176
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,000
distant and polite.

177
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,240
The Duke's heir you met

178
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,550
is quite different from

179
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,620
the refined brother

180
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
you had imagined,

181
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
isn't he?

182
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,840
I...

183
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,270
I laugh at you for seeing so little

184
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,470
of what's before you.

185
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,150
Master Shuyu, burdened by
his leg ailment, avoids society

186
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,390
and rarely appears before others.

187
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,920
But the Duke is getting old,

188
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,000
and his estate cannot
be left without an heir.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200
So he spares no effort

190
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,890
in forcing you to return to the family.

191
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,470
But if you truly acknowledge
him as your father,

192
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,700
Master Shuyu will fall from favor,
and then lose his title.

193
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,420
Left in such an awkward position,

194
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,080
how is he supposed to

195
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,540
face you, his own brother?

196
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,270
Don't tell me

197
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,550
you're not here to compete for the title.

198
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,680
That's not up to you.

199
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,920
Rong Shanbao.

200
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,280
What brings you here?

201
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,120
I told you already.

202
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't try to fool me with those words.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you intended to strike
back at the Duke's household,

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,260
there were other ways.

205
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,740
But you came in person,

206
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,060
patiently dealing with people,

207
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,980
listening to their nonsensical chatter.

208
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,790
Where do you find

209
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,320
such leisure and patience?

210
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,160
What is it you truly came for?

211
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,200
The trivial matters in the capital

212
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,010
are all handled by Yunshu and Yunling.

213
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,810
They are excellent assistants.

214
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,960
So I don't need to oversee
everything personally.

215
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,680
With this rare moment of leisure,

216
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,840
I came specifically

217
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,750
to see you, Lord Lu, tossing and turning,

218
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,010
your heart in torment,

219
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,820
torn between choices,
hesitant and indecisive.

220
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,780
And to see you
struggling between family ties

221
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,380
and wealth and power,

222
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,910
torn between

223
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,550
choosing your full brother

224
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,030
or that exalted seat of authority.

225
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,630
After all, with a single nod,

226
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,060
purple robes and jade belts will be yours,

227
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,520
and you will rise to high rank.

228
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,080
You will no longer need to struggle

229
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,280
or scheme endlessly,

230
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,670
entangled with those

231
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,670
contemptible figures of the world.

232
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,840
You can fully display your talents

233
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,240
in your official career,

234
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,630
and your name will be recorded in history.

235
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,550
It will repay the long years

236
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,610
of suffering endured by your mother,

237
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,390
the humiliations you suffered

238
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,980
because of your humble birth,

239
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,960
and all the lofty ambitions

240
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,970
you have long harbored.

241
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,440
Who is it?

242
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,110
My Lady, it's me.

243
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
Come in.

244
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,500
My Lady.

245
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,000
Just now, I went out

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,920
and heard from the servants

247
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,580
that the lady
of Hanyu Courtyard has fallen ill.

248
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,750
We've only been talking for a while

249
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,080
and she's already sick?

250
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,380
She's trying to blame you

251
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,640
and deliberately smear your reputation.

252
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,500
Just ignore it.

253
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,080
I don't mingle much

254
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,880
among the ladies of the capital.

255
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,170
My own reputation matters little.

256
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,720
However, the Duchess

257
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,090
is still my elder after all.

258
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,360
If she is indeed ill because of me,

259
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,160
I ought to go and pay my respects,

260
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,870
so as not to damage your reputation

261
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,550
as the Second Young Master
of the Duke's household,

262
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,830
cause others to accuse you
of disrespecting elders,

263
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,360
or ruin your bright future.

264
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,150
My Lady.

265
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,660
What's the matter?

266
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,280
You seem different

267
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,640
from how you are at home.

268
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,180
your words and actions

269
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,420
are hard to fathom.

270
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,740
I've noticed that

271
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,980
even Lord Lu appears confused

272
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,610
and unsure how to respond.

273
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,490
Just now,

274
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,950
he stood outside the door for a long time,

275
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,390
watching you leave.

276
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,560
His expression was quite forlorn.

277
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,730
I don't have any ill intentions.

278
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,600
I came only

279
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,260
on account of my own concerns.

280
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,910
My Lady, are your concerns

281
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,150
related to Lord Lu?

282
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,910
Once he inherits the title

283
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,600
and resumes his position

284
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,720
as the Duke's heir,

285
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,150
my concerns will be settled,

286
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,120
and I will be able to return

287
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,380
to Linji without any lingering worries.

288
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,750
My Lady, don't you

289
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,170
want to be with Lord Lu anymore?

290
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
The Lu Jianglai
who once strove tirelessly

291
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,260
and harbored great ambitions

292
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,310
was never meant to be with me.

293
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,500
The Duke's heir of Yongguo's household

294
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,350
and the heir of the Rong family

295
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,600
were never meant to walk the same path.

296
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,050
Go find Cheng Guanyu

297
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
and tell him to get

298
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,870
the box of ginseng from the carriage.

299
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,480
Yes.

300
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,030
Have you decided

301
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,030
what to carve on the bisque

302
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,230
for the kiln opening?

303
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,200
I'll have to give it some thought.

304
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Once it's carved,

305
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,820
the clay can't be reshaped.

306
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,400
So secretive.

307
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,280
Perhaps only by saying nothing

308
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
can I stay by her side for a lifetime.

309
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,540
That might be for the best.

310
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,590
[Imperial Yongguo Mansion]

311
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,930
Madam Chang suffers from diabetes

312
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,000
and cannot endure the slightest agitation.

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,510
And now you're forcing
a sick woman to move.

314
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,360
Where do you expect us to go?

315
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,230
Steward Xue.

316
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,120
How can there be

317
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,550
such unreasonable behavior in this world?

318
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,000
Madam Zheng,
please don't misunderstand me.

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,510
My Lady, something's wrong over there.

320
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,320
His Highness has said

321
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,580
that Hanyu Courtyard lies
too close to Baoshi Hall.

322
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,390
The late Duke spent his life
on the battlefield,

323
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,100
burdened with too much bloodshed.

324
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,000
Madam Chang may have been affected by it,

325
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,130
which is why her illness has lingered.

326
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,080
Asking Madam Chang to move to Yunzhen Hall

327
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,350
is also for the sake

328
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,560
of her health.

329
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,290
You scoundrel,

330
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,000
telling such blatant lies.

331
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,120
Yunzhen Hall is secluded

332
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,670
and sits right beside
the servants' quarters.

333
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,670
It has always been noisy and unruly.

334
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,490
You...

335
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,390
Madam Zheng.

336
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,050
Steward Xue.

337
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,250
Madam Chang has just taken her medicine
and lain down to rest.

338
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,050
Waking her up now

339
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,020
is not what we servants should do.

340
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,840
Please, Steward Xue, show some mercy

341
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,040
and go back to report to the Duke first.

342
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,170
Once Madam awakens,

343
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,940
we will certainly inform her.

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,590
We servants only follow orders.

345
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,730
His Highness commanded that
the move be made at around one-fifteen,

346
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,610
and we dare not delay for even a moment.

347
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,930
After all, the Duke's orders
are as firm as mountains.

348
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,780
No matter how much you care for Madam,

349
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,980
you wouldn't have me beaten, would you?

350
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,000
You can't go!

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,480
Steward Xue!

352
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,960
You can't go! You can't!

353
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,720
Don't go in there!

354
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,080
Steward Xue! Steward Xue!

355
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,420
You cannot go in there!

356
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,140
You cannot go in there!

357
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,470
Madam.

358
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,810
Why are you out here?

359
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,820
I am here on the Duke's orders.

360
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,420
He sent you to force me to relocate?

361
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,390
His Highness

362
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,960
is concerned about your health, Madam.

363
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,800
He said that

364
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,120
the ancients taught that
even in great thirst or hunger,

365
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,720
excess must be avoided.

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,900
Madam Chang, your illness

367
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,630
is the result of immoderation.

368
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,660
Excess leads to indigestion,

369
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,160
disrupting the balance
of blood and vital energy.

370
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,700
Yunzhen Hall is quiet and secluded,

371
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,880
making it ideal for convalescence.

372
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,089
From now on, a simple diet
of rice congee and vegetables,

373
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,569
and handling everything personally

374
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,300
will help restore your health.

375
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,920
You cannot go there.

376
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,640
I'm just a guest here,

377
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,210
so I shouldn't interfere.

378
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,480
But you can.

379
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,960
Madam Chang is extremely proud.

380
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,550
She would never allow her juniors

381
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,550
to see her in such a miserable state.

382
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,280
As her daughter-in-law,

383
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,460
I cannot damage her dignity even more.

384
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,520
The mistress of this noble household

385
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,400
is being forced by servants

386
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,850
to relocate while ill.

387
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Yet she still clings to her dignity.

388
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,440
What sense does that make?

389
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,140
Madam Chang comes from
a prestigious scholarly family.

390
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,470
Her grandfather was once the Grand Tutor.

391
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,260
Steward Xue wouldn't dare
offend her too much.

392
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,410
When has he ever

393
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,760
treated me so well?

394
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,480
Or is he afraid

395
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,440
I might die here in the courtyard

396
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,610
and bring him bad luck,

397
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,570
shortening his lifespan?

398
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,700
I wouldn't dare trouble you, Madam.

399
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,980
I'll help you move.

400
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,160
Who gave you permission
to stand here grinning,

401
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,240
talking out of turn

402
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,200
and showing no respect?

403
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,640
Do you have no manners at all?

404
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,400
Every generation's mistress
of the Xue household

405
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,000
has lived in this courtyard.

406
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,850
I was also married into the Xue family

407
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,410
with full propriety.

408
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,140
If Xue Maotang

409
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,500
wants me to move elsewhere,

410
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,030
let him come and tell me himself.

411
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,920
You servants have no right

412
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,200
to give orders here.

413
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,710
Madam Chang.

414
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,290
Get lost!

415
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,310
You heartless, treacherous wretch.

416
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,180
Get out now!

417
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,310
You whisper slanders
into your master's ear every day.

418
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,170
Heaven's thunder will strike
you dead eventually!

419
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,050
Madam Chang.

420
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,730
Madam.

421
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,510
Please go rest.

422
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,370
I apologize for this scene.

423
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,830
After Madam Chang has freshened up,

424
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,550
you can visit her then.

425
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,610
You didn't do anything wrong,

426
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,350
so why apologize?

427
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,800
This red ginseng has fine striations
and a brocaded surface,

428
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,250
is perfectly balanced
in the five elements,

429
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,450
and full of vitality.

430
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,540
This is indeed a top-grade,

431
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,920
century-old wild ginseng.

432
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,880
Miss Rong.

433
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,550
You're very thoughtful.

434
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,080
Madam, you're my elder
and very magnanimous.

435
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,840
I hope you won't mind
my earlier discourtesy.

436
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,980
Mother!

437
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,890
Madam Chang!

438
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,360
Madam.

439
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,560
Mother.

440
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,350
You're awake.

441
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,080
Are you feeling better?

442
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,410
The doctor will be here soon.

443
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,680
I don't want a doctor.

444
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,150
Make them all leave.

445
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,470
Out.

446
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,070
You all may leave now.

447
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,900
Madam Chang's agitation
has stirred heart fire,

448
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,350
causing hot phlegm to rise

449
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,810
and her head to feel dizzy.

450
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,100
A thin slice of the blood ginseng

451
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,600
placed beneath the tongue

452
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,240
will clear heat and calm the heart.

453
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,830
Yes.

454
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,200
Mrs. Xue, I'll take my leave now.

455
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,440
Please rest and recover, Madam.

456
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,770
Getting angry will only harm your health.

457
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,740
Stand there.

458
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,910
If you have any requests, Madam,

459
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,860
please wait until you've recovered.

460
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,200
You should speak less now

461
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,000
to avoid depleting your energy.

462
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,070
Come here.

463
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,930
I don't need your help.

464
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,050
So you won't bring out
your jade seal again.

465
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,590
Aren't you afraid

466
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,180
people will say
you're using your power to bully others?

467
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,160
Madam.

468
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,320
Political tactics are for
dealing with usurpers.

469
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,600
Knives are for dealing with bandits.

470
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,430
In business, harmony comes first.

471
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,600
My grandmother always says

472
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,290
that whatever method you use,

473
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,070
adapting to circumstances
is the key to victory.

474
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,080
The Duke's household
chose to rely on power first,

475
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
so I had no choice but to follow suit.

476
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,410
For any offense I've caused,

477
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,070
please don't take it to heart.

478
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,820
Old Madam Rong,

479
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,170
or rather, your grandmother,

480
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,720
I am indeed most curious to know

481
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,640
what manner of woman she is.

482
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,160
How could she raise

483
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,220
such an unruly granddaughter as you?

484
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,750
If you were born in the Chang family,

485
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,330
and dared to contradict your elders,

486
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,620
they would pull out your teeth,

487
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,750
so that you would be
too ashamed to speak again.

488
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,680
Well,

489
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm also proud to
be born in the Rong family.

490
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,200
In our family,

491
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,750
daughters who are meek and fearful

492
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,640
would have been
beaten harshly by Grandmother.

493
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Madam Chang, you should rest well,

494
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,310
lest I speak out of turn again

495
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,880
and anger you further.

496
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,580
That would be my fault.

497
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,500
Mother, Miss Rong is right.

498
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,110
You should lie down for a while.

499
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,370
I haven't finished asking my questions.

500
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,270
Madam Chang,
what exactly do you want to ask?

501
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,540
Has your grandmother

502
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,790
really never married?

503
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,790
She never married,

504
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,720
nor was she ever married off.

505
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,890
By your logic,

506
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,820
I have three grandfathers.

507
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,420
Miss Rong.

508
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,240
Don't ever say

509
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,720
such shocking words
in front of Madam Chang.

510
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Let her speak.

511
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,960
Divorces happen all the time.

512
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,440
But it's not something to be proud of.

513
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,400
This is the first time

514
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,850
I've heard someone
speak so boldly about it.

515
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,110
With the wealth and status
of our Rong family,

516
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,570
if Grandmother were truly

517
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,270
after young and handsome men,

518
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,400
it would be easy for her to have a few.

519
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
But she said that

520
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,420
what matters is mutual affection

521
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,950
and a harmonious marriage.

522
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,720
Even if you asked her to find another,

523
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
she would find it too troublesome.

524
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,480
Unfortunately, fate is unpredictable,

525
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,080
always leading her to the wrong people

526
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,610
and denying her happiness.

527
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,490
So she had no choice but to turn back

528
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,350
and find another suitable match.

529
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,830
In a lifetime,

530
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,960
to meet even one true lover

531
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,070
is fortune enough.

532
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,030
For those who indulge in pleasures

533
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,080
and passions,

534
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
having ten lovers is no excess.

535
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,880
Spring brings warmth and flowers bloom.

536
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,280
Winter comes and the rivers freeze.

537
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,200
Reunions and partings are inevitable.

538
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,970
It's best to let things take their course.

539
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,410
Madam, I'll take my leave now.

540
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,510
Wan.

541
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,160
Did you hear that?

542
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,580
I never imagined there could be

543
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,600
such a woman in this world.

544
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,370
The way she just spoke to me

545
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,920
was so different.

546
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,790
You all saw what just happened.

547
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,240
Living to this day,

548
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,030
I have to endure a little girl

549
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,910
pitying me.

550
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,030
How ridiculous.

551
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,430
Mother.

552
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,350
Miss Rong is broad-minded.

553
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,920
Though she doesn't always
follow proper etiquette,

554
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,580
she is a kind-hearted person.

555
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,990
She's standing up for you

556
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,080
and won't spread this matter around.

557
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,550
Everyone was once young,

558
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,920
charming, and fair.

559
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,440
Yet my parents reproached me

560
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,570
for being too alluring and seductive.

561
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,820
So they shaved off my eyebrows

562
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,980
and bound my feet,

563
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,310
teaching me to be proper, obedient,

564
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,720
and cautious in speech and behavior.

565
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,850
But when I married into the Xue family,

566
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,440
he said that

567
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,030
in all my movements and expressions,

568
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,340
I followed the rules too rigidly.

569
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
I could not compare to his late wife,

570
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,720
who was beautiful, cheerful

571
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,630
and skilled in all the arts, from music
and chess to calligraphy and painting.

572
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,430
He called me a block of stone,

573
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,510
a calculating mind.

574
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,980
He said

575
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,330
I did not know how to please him,

576
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,310
and was not romantic enough.

577
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,480
So after just ten days of marriage,

578
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,580
he never came to my room again.

579
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,750
And me?

580
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,060
All these years,

581
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,290
I've managed his household,

582
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,670
worked endlessly,

583
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,540
upheld his reputation,

584
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,280
and brought one concubine
after another for him

585
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,810
over the course of twenty years.

586
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,350
My husband...

587
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,240
My husband

588
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,270
has been dead for twenty years.

589
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,250
Madam, you must be losing your mind!

590
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,590
You can't say

591
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,880
things like that in front of others.

592
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,650
What's there to hide anymore?

593
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,790
Mother.

594
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,300
Mother, please don't continue.

595
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,280
Don't let others hear it.

596
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,720
Well.

597
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,530
Your life is even harder than mine.

598
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,550
The Duke's household is prestigious,

599
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,550
wealthy and bustling.

600
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,510
But what do I have to do
with their family bonds?

601
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,270
I...

602
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,030
I subsist on mere meals,

603
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,330
yet he refuses

604
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,790
to give me a courtyard

605
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,110
to live in.

606
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,680
Why should I

607
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,550
keep up appearances for him?

608
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,870
Why should I?

609
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,190
Mother, you're tired.

610
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,940
I'll come pay my respects again tomorrow.

611
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,730
Wan.

612
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:40,930
Your fate

613
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,280
is a little better than mine.

614
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,000
At least

615
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,310
you have a son

616
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
who can inherit the title.

617
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,180
Nanny.

618
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm so tired.

619
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,480
Madam Chang.

620
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,540
I'm so tired.

621
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,430
[Fuping Pavilion]

622
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,510
-Please spare my life. Master Shuyu.
-Please spare my life. Master Shuyu.

623
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,440
Please spare my life.

624
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,570
-Please spare my life. Master Shuyu.
-Please spare my life. Master Shuyu.

625
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,310
Get out!

626
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,030
Get out now.

627
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,930
Yes.

628
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,090
I told you to get out!

629
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,070
Why are you mad at me?

630
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,400
It wasn't me who made father

631
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,270
punish you.

632
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,770
You're clearly the one
stirring up trouble.

633
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,920
If you hadn't provoked Rong Shanbao,

634
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,850
why would Father have punished me?

635
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,380
Because you're disabled,

636
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,880
stripped of

637
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,680
your right to inherit the title,

638
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,610
everything bad in this house

639
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
is automatically blamed on you.

640
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,320
Why are you mad at me?

641
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,600
You should

642
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,720
blame your mother

643
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,120
for giving you a brother.

644
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,710
Even without the title,

645
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,950
I'm still the Duke's son,

646
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,750
the Eldest Young Master of this household.

647
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,940
You fool.

648
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,780
You don't know that

649
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,720
Lu Jianglai

650
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,530
has been locked in
the Daiyan Tower by Father.

651
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,040
The longer he holds out,

652
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,520
the more danger you're in.

653
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,550
If Lu Jianglai agrees, that's fine.

654
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,410
But if he keeps refusing...

655
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,590
What happens

656
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,440
if he doesn't agree?

657
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,640
The emotional cannot achieve great deeds,

658
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,270
and the compassionate
cannot command armies.

659
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,130
Father is ruthless and decisive,

660
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,490
strict beyond measure.

661
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,400
He spares no one

662
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,990
who disobeys his will.

663
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,350
If Lu Jianglai refuses,

664
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,610
it must be out of concern
for your brotherly bond.

665
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,270
He does not wish to bear the blame

666
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,720
for usurping your title

667
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,180
while you are still alive.

668
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,530
But

669
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,790
can you

670
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,880
really live long enough?

671
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,010
No.

672
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,910
He won't do it.

673
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,310
He won't.

674
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,430
Is that really so?

675
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,270
Others might not know,

676
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,790
but you do.

677
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,520
Back then, it was you who reported

678
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,970
the secret affair between
his favorite Madam Fang,

679
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,830
and the steward of the household.

680
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,550
Have you forgotten

681
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,790
that how Father

682
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,770
dealt with them?

683
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,840
That woman

684
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,340
was eventually

685
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,430
driven insane by fear.

686
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,720
Weren't you so scared that

687
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,680
you couldn't sleep for half a year?

688
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,440
Father then scolded you for being
weak and incompetent,

689
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,790
unable to stand the slightest bloodshed,

690
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,510
nothing like his son at all.

691
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,610
But look at this now.

692
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,880
A proper son has come.

693
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,830
He is talented in all matters,
resolute and brave.

694
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,920
I heard that

695
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,750
he handled

696
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,310
the affairs in Linji so well

697
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,250
that he earned the Emperor's favor.

698
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,350
My dear brother,

699
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,160
who is truly the Xue Shuyu?

700
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,200
It's him, isn't it?

701
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,370
If you don't get rid of him,

702
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,830
you'll be the one who suffers.

703
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,280
My dear brother.

704
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,480
I feel so sorry for you.

705
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,800
Then

706
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,489
what should I do?

707
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,640
This is nice.

708
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,920
How do I look?

709
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,390
Surely you're a refined gentleman,

710
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,650
handsome and elegant.

711
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,670
Then will you come

712
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,760
with me?

713
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,980
You brothers will surely wish

714
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,040
to talk long into the night.

715
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,680
There are things

716
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,840
best not said before others.

717
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,480
Yunyin has been much more obedient lately,

718
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,630
listening to Yunxi

719
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,840
and diligently studying tea-healing.

720
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,550
Next month, I plan

721
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,350
to send her out with the tea team.

722
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,630
Only by understanding
the hard work of her elder sisters

723
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,360
will she become more sensible.

724
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,360
This is all thanks to you.

725
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,300
I'm very grateful.

726
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,840
It's all thanks to your guidance.

727
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,640
I wouldn't dare take the credit.

728
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,820
You keep telling me

729
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,840
that unending leniency among sisters

730
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,170
will only cause trouble

731
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
and create rifts.

732
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,340
And that perfect sisterly affection

733
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,470
is also impossible.

734
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,760
Bao, thank you for reminding me.

735
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,510
I've never tied

736
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,570
a scented sachet for any man before.

737
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,570
You're the first.

738
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,640
Wait for me tonight.

739
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,920
I have something important to tell you.

740
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,720
Be careful.

741
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,140
This piece

742
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,040
was left by Mother years ago.

743
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,680
Unfortunately, it's only half complete.

744
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,320
After Mother passed away,

745
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,110
no one played it anymore.

746
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,550
I felt it a great pity

747
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,050
and sought many people
to complete the second half,

748
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,230
but none could do it satisfactorily.

749
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,190
Eventually I decided to compose it myself.

750
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
What do you think?

751
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,840
The piece you completed

752
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,760
is excellent.

753
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,200
The first half is full of spirit,

754
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,620
graceful and delicate.

755
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,870
The second half is technically sound,

756
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,670
but lacks the same inspiration.

757
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,360
My talent is limited.

758
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,560
I failed to inherit
Mother's artistic gifts.

759
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,360
What I added is but a poor extension,

760
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,220
and is likely to invite ridicule.

761
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,060
She was extraordinarily talented.

762
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,360
At sixteen, her writings had already
made her famous in the capital.

763
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,030
How many women of such talent

764
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,800
and beauty exist today?

765
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm merely

766
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,920
using this piece

767
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,190
to express my

768
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,400
longing for her.

769
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,320
Mother?

770
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,950
Who exactly is your real mother?

771
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,070
That woman who nearly

772
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,930
drove your birth mother to death?

773
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,690
You've come all this way

774
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,960
and won't even take a single cup of wine.

775
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,820
What kind of sense does that make?

776
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,190
Drink this one,

777
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,530
and I'll pour you another.

778
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,030
Xun.

779
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:57,850
Come.

780
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,780
Come over here.

781
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,110
Come to me.

782
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,030
Your father is looking for you.

783
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,630
Just go.

784
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,860
Xun, come here.

785
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,630
This is your Uncle Jianglai.

786
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,230
Greet him.

787
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,710
Are you Xun?

788
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,880
Xun, say hello.

789
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,060
Call him Uncle Jianglai.

790
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,590
Xun, say hello.

791
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,580
It's his first time meeting you,

792
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,760
so he's a little shy.

793
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,540
Please don't mind, Jianglai.

794
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,170
It's fine.

795
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:37,610
Xun.

796
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,230
Here.

797
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,010
Take this and go play.

798
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,590
Go.

799
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,360
At such a young age,

800
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,690
Xun dares to embarrass
his father in public.

801
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,800
You've raised such a

802
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,920
disobedient son.

803
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,550
As his mother, you are to blame.

804
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,480
Hurry and offer Jianglai a cup

805
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,350
to apologize.

806
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,410
What are you all standing there for?

807
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,010
Keep singing! Keep dancing!

808
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,790
Other wives serve their husbands

809
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,320
like subjects serving their lord,

810
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,060
respectful and obedient in everything.

811
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,110
But you?

812
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,270
When I'm enjoying
family time with my brother,

813
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,800
you sulk, and deliberately

814
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,960
try to ruin my mood!

815
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,260
You've taught Xun
to disrespect his elders,

816
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,320
and turned him into a timid, weak boy.

817
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,280
Are you deaf?

818
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,690
If Jianglai won't drink,

819
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,150
then just persuade him to!

820
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,760
Shuyu.

821
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,770
In front of others,

822
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,960
you should show respect to Huiqing.

823
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,800
How could you order her

824
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,940
to offer drinks
in front of all these dancers?

825
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,000
That's not proper.

826
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,460
Huiqing, just forget about it.

827
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,190
No way!

828
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,320
Father always praises you
for being virtuous,

829
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,150
yet I can't even get you

830
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,710
to offer a single cup of wine.

831
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,710
What kind of virtuous woman are you?

832
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,490
I'm not a virtuous woman,

833
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,770
and you're not a virtuous man either.

834
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,550
Perhaps I committed

835
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,080
too many sins in my past life

836
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,670
to be condemned

837
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,730
to marry into your miserable family!

838
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,310
What did you say?

839
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,140
Shuyu, what are you doing?

840
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,590
Everyone, leave.

841
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,670
Whoever dares to leak this matter

842
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,190
or gossip about it privately,

843
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,190
if even a word

844
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,000
reaches me,

845
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,840
I will show no mercy.

846
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,440
Yes.

847
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,190
Jianglai, you're quite impressive,

848
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,820
giving orders in my courtyard now.

849
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,960
Shuyu.

850
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,770
You're truly drunk.

851
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,640
Right.

852
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,840
I've had too much to drink

853
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
and misspoke.

854
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,980
Jianglai, don't take offense.

855
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,650
I've just recently come to the household.

856
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,610
But Huiqing comes from a noble family

857
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,140
and is gentle and virtuous.

858
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,330
She attends to you personally

859
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
with utmost care.

860
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,640
Everyone here respects her.

861
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,970
No matter how displeased you are,

862
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,710
you shouldn't embarrass her

863
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,920
in front of others.
