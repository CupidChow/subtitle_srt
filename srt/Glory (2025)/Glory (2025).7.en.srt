[Glory]

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,120
Marking the boat
won't find the lost sword.

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,070
Fixed rules can't handle all changes.

5
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,759
Sometimes, to get things done,

6
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,000
we servants

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,960
have to season the bland,

8
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,350
or turn down the boil.

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,680
We can't report every detail

10
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,940
to the steward in time.

11
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,320
Please forgive me, Ms. Yan.

12
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,720
How dare you talk so much?

13
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,870
Who gave you the guts

14
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,930
to be so disrespectful in front of me?

15
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,860
I did.

16
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,030
Greetings, Miss Rong.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,630
Mrs. Yan,

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,840
I asked him to attend the tea party.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,770
Don't blame him.

20
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,030
Miss Rong,

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,120
this man is just

22
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,650
a beggar of unknown origin.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,840
Favoring him like this

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
will stir gossip.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,730
It might bring trouble.

26
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,750
What?

27
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,079
If I choose to favor him,

28
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,130
by what right do others dare question me?

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
I spoke out of turn. Please forgive me.

30
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,340
The swing rope in my courtyard is broken.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,350
I can fix it today.

32
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,680
So aren't you coming?

33
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
Not only is the rope broken,

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
but the wooden seat
is also rotten with age.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,960
But it's nothing serious.

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,930
In about two hours,

37
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,680
I can make

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,610
a new one for you.

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,590
The old one has its charm.

40
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,120
No need to bother making a new one.

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,380
Just replace the rope.

42
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,760
Well... Miss Rong, this is...

43
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,840
I'd like to

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,300
ask you for another favor.

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
You come from a noble house,

46
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,680
with everyone at your call.

47
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,750
What else could you possibly

48
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,840
need my help with?

49
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,360
As you know,

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,990
my cousin

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,850
is a man with no schemes.

52
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,390
You can rest assured, Miss Rong.

53
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,640
I won't forget what I've promised.

54
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,110
I will do my utmost to protect him.

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,760
Today I made you dress up for the feast.

56
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,470
I also showed you great favor

57
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,690
and praised you repeatedly.

58
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,079
You're smart.

59
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,420
You should understand my true intention.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,360
I got it.

61
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,190
I've been risking my life for him,

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,430
but you still don't think it's enough.

63
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:34,920
Now you want me

64
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,159
to be his shield?

65
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,420
For him, I get slandered, envied,

66
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,560
take the hits, open and hidden,

67
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,480
face various danger..

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,159
All because he is

69
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,159
your cousin,

70
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,580
he gets your protection,

71
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,000
while someone like me, with no background

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,750
and low status, should just go die?

73
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,150
Am I not born from parents

74
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,120
who can also feel suffering and pain?

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,270
Haven't I risked my life for you,

76
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,040
Miss Rong?

77
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,850
For the sake of your childhood cousin,

78
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,920
you'd just stand by

79
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,520
and watch me walk to my death?

80
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,360
Enough with the life and death talk.

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,620
You're overstepping.

82
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,630
If it weren't for

83
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,720
Miss Rong's kindness in saving people,

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
you think you'd survive till today?

85
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,450
I'll repay your kindness one day,

86
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,560
Miss Rong,

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,800
but in this way.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,830
If that's all,

89
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,890
I'll take my leave.

90
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Stop right there!

91
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,200
I will fix the swing,

92
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,260
you can rest assured, Miss Rong.

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,240
Damn it!

94
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,120
Miss Rong!

95
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,120
The Rong family has more than

96
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,180
just him to rely on.

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,360
Without him,

98
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,159
can't I get things done?

99
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:46,810
You there.

100
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,159
This swing was personally built

101
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,830
by Mr. Wen for Miss Rong.

102
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,850
Please be careful with it.

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,970
Old things have their charm.

104
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,600
No need to bother making a new one.

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,860
Just replace the rope.

106
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,540
I recognized your footsteps.

107
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,480
You're that scholar named Bai.

108
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,270
If you were like me,

109
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,720
relying only on your hearing for years

110
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,450
to distinguish subtle sounds,

111
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,680
you would know that

112
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,480
no two footsteps sound the same.

113
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,360
I came specifically

114
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,820
to thank you, Lady Yunshu.

115
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,780
Thank you for your guidance
at the tea party.

116
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,080
Come closer.

117
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,950
Even closer, please.

118
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,950
What are you smelling, Lady Yunshu?

119
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,870
There's a scent on you.

120
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,390
It's the stench of ink
accumulated over years

121
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,120
from copying books for others.

122
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,000
What?

123
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,160
Aren't you offended by what I said?

124
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,510
I did make my living
by copying books for others,

125
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,270
which earned me the headmaster's favor.

126
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,310
Later I was exempted from tuition fees

127
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,970
and recommended to come here.

128
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,870
Being born poor isn't my fault.

129
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,270
There's nothing to be angry about.

130
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,680
Yunyin is very upset.

131
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,110
She sent you invitations twice,

132
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,840
both politely declined by you.

133
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
I just heard your footsteps

134
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
hesitating,

135
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,280
not daring to approach.

136
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,830
Is there any concern?

137
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,390
To speak frankly,

138
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,430
the Rong family has many people
and much gossip.

139
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,630
I fear provoking idle talk and trouble.

140
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,750
We sisters are all at marriageable age.

141
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,270
You fear getting close

142
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,830
might spark romantic rumors,

143
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,310
private entanglements and karma,

144
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,920
which will ruin your reputation
and prospects.

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,250
You're truly pedantic.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,260
But you worry too much.

147
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,970
In this lifetime,

148
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,950
I would absolutely
never take a poor scholar

149
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,870
as my husband.

150
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,890
Absolutely never.

151
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,650
I've expressed my thanks. I should go now.

152
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,160
Years ago, my mom and her parents

153
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,960
fled from the north as refugees.

154
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,120
The whole family crowded into a small,

155
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,850
low-roofed shack in Nanxiawa.

156
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,390
You were able

157
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,840
to find copying work to do,

158
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,570
but she could only sell herself

159
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,870
to enter the Rong Mansion

160
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,200
as a lowly maid.

161
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,360
So our conversations

162
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
won't attract unwanted attention.

163
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,360
Because everyone knows

164
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,850
that I, a little blind girl,

165
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,840
want to firmly plant my roots

166
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,390
in these tea hills,

167
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,200
can only seek a helpful husband

168
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
from families like Yang or He

169
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,670
to please grandmother,

170
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,270
and gain a better position
in this family.

171
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,080
So...

172
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,630
So we can talk

173
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,910
anytime,

174
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,790
anything,

175
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,550
and in any way.

176
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,380
After all, you're tactful and likable.

177
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,630
If I were Shanbao,

178
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,940
lacking neither gold nor silver,

179
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,030
possessing both status and position,

180
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,440
and all I lacked was an interesting person

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,500
to keep my company,

182
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,520
I would definitely choose you.

183
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,720
Thank you for your kind words,
Lady Yunshu.

184
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,790
But your Rong family
seeks a matrilocal husband,

185
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,650
not a playmate.

186
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,870
Then you're quite mistaken.

187
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,150
A son-in-law in the Rong family,

188
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,600
apart from continuing the bloodline,

189
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,060
is nothing but a playmate.

190
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,960
It can only be

191
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,000
mutual respect and emotionally distant.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,960
If one day

193
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,990
Shanbao develops true feelings,

194
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,840
then you'd be in danger.

195
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,150
The way you put it,

196
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,420
the Rong family truly
is a dangerous place.

197
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,890
You really know how to joke.

198
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,910
A joke?

199
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,390
Yes, it's a joke.

200
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,670
And I

201
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,070
cannot only joke around,

202
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,600
but also help you.

203
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,220
Yeju.

204
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,050
Lady Yunshu.

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,200
I lost my grip.

206
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeju,

207
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,000
show Mr. Bai the way.

208
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,270
Let him get changed

209
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,870
Going back like this is hardly proper.

210
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,320
Yes.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,480
Everything has its order of precedence

212
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,070
and degrees of intimacy.

213
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,890
They grew up together,

214
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,150
with deep feelings for each other.

215
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,550
She wants to protect him.

216
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,370
That's only human nature.

217
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,600
Nothing to fault.

218
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,420
And what are you, then?

219
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,130
Do you really expect her
to care about you?

220
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,200
There's no business in this world
that can't be discussed.

221
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
If she wants your help

222
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,150
with that matter,

223
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,790
she'll surely reward you well.

224
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,320
What are you so angry about?

225
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,920
Who let  you lose your temper like that!

226
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,390
Idiot!

227
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,070
This way, Mr. Bai.

228
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,960
Their business

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,280
has nothing to do with me.

230
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,140
I'll ignore it.

231
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,370
Maybe I should go check it out anyway.

232
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,430
Everyone, come and see

233
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,510
who's hiding

234
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,510
in here.

235
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,280
Lady Yunyin,

236
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,270
how could there be

237
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,550
a lady who peeps at men changing clothes?

238
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,630
Have you no shame?

239
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,010
Give me back my clothes now.

240
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,780
I've shown you my affection
multiple times,

241
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,850
but you didn't want my respect.

242
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,870
So why should I save your reputation?

243
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,750
Of course I'll invite everyone

244
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,840
to come and see

245
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,650
how thick your skin really is.

246
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,240
Well?

247
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,440
No matter how high and mighty,

248
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,240
how cunning and sly you think you are,

249
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,900
you still ended up in my hands.

250
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,270
Yunshu,

251
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,320
you really have a way.

252
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,670
With only few words,

253
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,150
you vented the anger on my behalf.

254
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,360
A liar with full of lies.

255
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,890
I shouldn't have trusted you.

256
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,700
Mr. Bai,

257
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,790
I advise you

258
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,320
to quickly kowtow to Yunyin

259
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,900
and admit your mistake.

260
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,120
Otherwise, if she really gets angry,

261
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,150
and throws you out on the street naked,

262
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,940
or tells everyone you stripped

263
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,670
and harassed the Rong's maid,

264
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,550
the consequences would be unimaginable.

265
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,870
That's right. Kowtow.

266
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,600
Kowtow. Do it now.

267
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,880
Once you kowtow, all will be forgiven.
Hurry up.

268
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,650
What are you waiting for? Hurry.

269
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,790
Kowtow!
Why are you just standing there?

270
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,480
Faster!
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

271
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
Kowtow now! Quickly!

272
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,410
That's right. Kowtow!

273
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,130
Kowtow now!

274
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,510
The spring air is still chilly.

275
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,640
Mr. Bai,
please take care of yourself.

276
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,840
Who asked you to meddle?

277
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,810
Lady Yunyin,

278
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,630
if Miss Rong were to learn of this,

279
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,000
it might not be wise.

280
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,880
Don't use her to intimidate me.

281
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
Tie him up too.

282
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,510
Strip him naked
and throw him at the front gate.

283
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,550
I want to see

284
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,390
if Rong Shanbao

285
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,520
will turn against me

286
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,790
for this servant.

287
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,430
Look outside, please.

288
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,640
Rong Yunyin,  how impressive you are.

289
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,560
Only you get to choose personally.

290
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,820
Does that mean I can't?

291
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,790
How stingy.

292
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,960
If he were willing,

293
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,690
I wouldn't even care.

294
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,720
But he's unwilling now,

295
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,870
and you're forcing yourself on him.

296
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,270
Are you a highway robber

297
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,960
or a vicious murderer?

298
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,600
Since when did the Rong family

299
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,150
teach you to treat guests like this?

300
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,270
You're arrogant and provoking trouble.

301
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,390
If Grandmother hears of this tomorrow,

302
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,200
I guarantee you won't

303
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,860
set foot in the tea plantation
this year either.

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,660
As if I care!

305
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,620
Even pork ribs
are better-looking than him.

306
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,730
What's a man afraid of being seen for?

307
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,440
Can't even take a little joke.

308
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm leaving.

309
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,390
Shanbao, you'd better be careful.

310
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,620
If he's so afraid of being seen,

311
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,120
he must have hidden sores.

312
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,670
You're slandering me!

313
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,110
Let's go.

314
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,120
Calm down.

315
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,720
Getting angry is exactly what she wants.

316
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,390
She'll claim even more
that you have a disease.

317
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,440
Shanbao, it was Yunyin who...

318
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,080
I...

319
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,180
It's alright. I don't blame you.

320
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
Just don't follow her
into mischief again.

321
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,230
Mr. Bai, Yunyin was rude and offensive.

322
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,550
Let me escort you back
to Xinfang Pavilion.

323
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,110
Thank you, Miss Rong.

324
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,360
And as your friend,

325
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,760
I can not only joke around

326
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,150
but also help you.

327
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,000
This time,
he could turn misfortune and disaster

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
into blessing,

329
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,400
he should thank you as the matchmaker.

330
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,280
Mr. Lu,

331
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,290
you really are a good person.

332
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,240
Yunyin has been spoiled by Grandmother
since childhood.

333
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,030
She acts recklessly
and speaks without restraint.

334
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,400
I appreciate your tolerance
and generosity

335
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,590
for not taking offense
at a young girl's behavior.

336
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,650
I thank you on Grandmother's behalf.

337
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,780
Don't worry, Miss Rong.

338
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,240
Today's matter will not be spread from me,

339
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,960
nor will it

340
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,710
tarnish the Rong family's reputation.

341
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,880
Let me serve the tea.

342
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,510
Mr. Bai,

343
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,540
Lady Rong just sent a doctor

344
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,400
to examine all the young masters

345
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,460
for a health check.

346
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,540
Lady Rong...

347
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,250
I suppose Lady Yunyin

348
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,000
went back and exaggerated everything,

349
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,720
shifting the blame onto you.

350
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,400
Lady Rong, misled by slander,

351
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,200
now seeks medical examination.

352
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Given the situation,

353
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,250
you should return quickly,

354
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,070
lest outsiders say

355
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,070
you fled the scene

356
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,750
and confirm

357
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,010
the slander
of hidden sores or ailments.

358
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,600
Miss Rong,

359
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,110
I concede today's game of chess.

360
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,180
Another day,
I'll seek your guidance again.

361
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,440
See you, Mr. Bai.

362
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,030
How dare you fabricate orders!

363
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,240
There was indeed a doctor today,

364
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,230
coming to do health checks.

365
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,230
I didn't deliberately deceive him.

366
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,720
However,

367
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
if you're looking for a substitute,

368
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,500
I don't think Mr. Bai is suitable.

369
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,360
I'd like to hear the reason.

370
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,790
He is adaptable

371
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,480
to changing circumstances.

372
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,340
Unfortunately, he's too clever.

373
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,720
He avoids conflict when he can,

374
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,780
lacking courage and determination.

375
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,110
Just like in this chess game,

376
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,600
he clearly had chances to win,

377
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,110
but he

378
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,830
feared you wouldn't be pleased

379
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,070
and was constantly hesitating,

380
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,160
unable to make a decision.

381
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,820
In his eyes,

382
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,350
you're just someone

383
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,570
who would get upset over losing a game.

384
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,910
What kind of person does he take you for?

385
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,160
He's a man
who hides and conceals before you.

386
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,000
He's too afraid

387
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,330
to show his true nature.

388
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,630
Don't you find him boring, Miss Rong?

389
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,360
If he's boring,
what makes you interesting?

390
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,480
He lacks courage,

391
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,740
but you have boldness?

392
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,380
You clearly rejected me outright before,

393
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,480
yet now you came and changed your mind.

394
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,550
As a person who goes back on his word

395
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,970
and changes sides without remorse,

396
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,230
why should I trust you?

397
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,000
Because I understand your thoughts

398
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,640
more thoroughly than he does.

399
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,200
Because I can

400
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,480
complete any task you assign

401
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,880
with perfect execution.

402
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,240
Because I

403
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,720
won this chess game today.

404
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,480
What do you want?

405
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,550
Being your beloved one

406
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,030
is like pulling chestnuts from the fire.

407
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,690
It's a dangerous task indeed.

408
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,450
What's in it for me?

409
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,820
I won't just guide you, lost lamb, home.

410
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,510
I'll find out

411
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,040
who really wanted you dead.

412
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,910
I'll ward off disasters for you,

413
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,040
and make sure you come to no harm.

414
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,460
Is that enough?

415
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,720
Yes, that's enough.

416
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,650
Miss Rong, you're truly generous.

417
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,840
But… when you
stroll in the garden with a man,

418
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,970
it's always just chess, cards, or tea.

419
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,850
Going in circles in this little patch.

420
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,240
If you try to pass that off

421
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,680
as a lovers' tryst…

422
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,290
Well, nobody would buy it.

423
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,290
So what do you suggest?

424
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,150
What would look convincing?

425
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,220

until you scared the soul

right out of me!

476
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,590
Miss Rong,
since you need to talk with Mr. Wen,

477
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,850
I'll take my leave now.

478
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,160
Shanbao, you're usually

479
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,310
not one for such playful activities.

480
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,000
What possessed you
to swing so recklessly today?

481
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,130
Just a passing whim.

482
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,280
What made you here today?

483
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,130
[Rong Mansion]

484
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,550
Lu Fusheng!

485
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,010
What makes you so cheerful?

486
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,000
Everyone in the household

487
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,420
is busy preparing
for the Tea Ancestor Festival Ceremony.

488
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,950
I instructed you yesterday

489
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,350
to gather everyone listed

490
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,880
on the roster early this morning

491
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,110
to receive my assignments.

492
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,030
Did my words just vanish into thin air?

493
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,890
Steward Cheng,

494
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,880
with hundreds of souls
in the Rong Mansion,

495
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,310
isn't that enough for you to command?

496
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,000
On my first day here,

497
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,980
I made myself perfectly clear.

498
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,920
I stayed only out of gratitude

499
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,030
for Miss Rong saving my life,

500
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,790
nothing more.

501
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,350
You can give those ceremonial duties, .

502
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,550
the offerings, the tea service

503
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,610
to anyone you like.

504
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,570
I only answer to Qilan Garden.

505
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,110
I can't be bothered
with such trivial matters.

506
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,110
Outrageous!

507
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,830
If Miss Rong knew about

508
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,160
your insolent remarks,

509
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,500
she'd be the first to punish you.

510
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,820
Go ahead and tell her then.

511
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,160
I'm busy

512
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,680
making a kite for Bao.

513
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,740
No time for your chatter.

514
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,030
How dare you call Miss Rong 's nick name!

515
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,400
'Willow twigs for thread,
catkin for cotton spun,

516
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,790
A thousand lengths
to fly the paper kite begun.

517
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,690
How much of
the spring breeze's strength is spent,

518
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,690
To carry the young ones
to the heavens, heaven-sent?'

519
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,770
Mr. Yang, what are you doing here?

520
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,400
The person who fought me

521
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,240
at the martial arts arena that day
was you, wasn't it?

522
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,840
Mr. Yang, you must be joking.

523
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,720
A mere servant like me

524
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,250
wouldn't be worthy
of the martial arts arena.

525
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,830
It was Mr. Wen who bested you.

526
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,890
Don't block my way.

527
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,240
What exactly do you want?

528
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,030
To have a rematch, of course.

529
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,860
Steward Cheng!

530
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,650
Steward Cheng!

531
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,830
Just listen to this!

532
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,450
What nonsense is he talking?

533
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,160
A real man stands firm
between heaven and earth.

534
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,280
His word is his bond.

535
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,920
How can someone lose

536
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,380
and then demand a rematch?

537
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,350
The sheer gall!

538
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,070
Come on, explain this to me.

539
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,680
Be my witness!

540
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,960
A real man would never do anything

541
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,680
sneaky

542
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,240
or underhanded.

543
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,030
If you win,

544
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,930
win with honor,

545
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,760
so others truly accept defeat.

546
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,920
No, you can't agree.

547
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,270
You can't accept this.

548
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,590
Do not engage in private fights!

549
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,900
If you're too scared to fight,

550
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,650
then pack and get out of the Rong family.

551
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,130
Fine, let's have this contest.

552
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,150
I'm not afraid of you.

553
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,480
Good.

554
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,680
Tomorrow at noon,

555
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,440
I'll wait for you in the bamboo grove
behind the hill.

556
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,960
Mr. Bai, please

557
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,000

Also,

knowing how jealous he is,

562
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,270
you should have avoided him.

563
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,240
How can you knowingly

564
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,130
walk into a dead end

565

It makes saving you worthwhile.

You'll die!

You all drink and gamble,

only to send me here to sharpen swords?

You really look out for me.

I'll do your work for you.

You're quite clever and careful.

591
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,850
Miss Rong repeatedly instructed me

592
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,180
to take good care of you.

593

I couldn't bear the punishment.

Did she really say that?

596
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,160

how can you still sit here so calmly?

600
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,450
I'll go inform Miss Rong right away.

No hurry.

602
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,550
When you see Miss Rong,

603
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,680
what do you plan to tell her?

604
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,880
The truth, of course.

When you see her,

don't mention a single word

00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,450
about what happened today.

608
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,720
You may only tell her

609
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,510
that I've accepted the challenge.

610
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,240
Tomorrow I will fight that Yang fellow

611

to the death.

No matter how much I pleaded,

613

Mr. Lu wouldn't listen.

Tomorrow's contest
is a matter of life and death.

He came here at this moment

622
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,310
surely for something important.

623
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,440
Why stop at the door without coming in?

You can't fight with him.

00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,110
So you're saying that
by testing him for Shanbao,

746
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,030
you are not at fault
but actually deserve credit?

747
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,670
Grandmother should reward you instead?

748
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,000
You!

749
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,140
You're all in this together.

750
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,440
How can you twist
right and wrong like this?

751
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,500
You'd slander a good person to death.

752
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,110
You lost.

753
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,150
My skills are inferior — I lost, so be it.

754
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,880
Mr. Lu.

755
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,230
Mr. Lu.

756
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,300
Mr. Lu, are you all right?

757
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,070
Mr. Lu.

758
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,180
Mr. Lu. what's wrong?

759
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,000
Mr. Lu.

760
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,440
Mr. Lu.

761
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,130
Mr. Lu, are you okay?

762
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,000
Mr. Lu.

763
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,590
Mr. Lu.

764
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,210
Mr. Lu, what's wrong?

765
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,550
Mr. Lu, don't scare me like this!

766
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,920
Grandmother.

767
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,320
Grandmother.

768
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,630
I meant well.

769
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,590
Please don't blame me.

770
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,280
People say idle hands make mischief.

771
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,150
If you would allow me

772
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,670
to gain experience at the tea plantation,

773
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,230
perhaps there wouldn't be

774
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,230
so many problems.

775
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,760
Don't worry, Grandmother.

776
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,290
Mr. Bai knows what matters.

777
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,050
He won't spread it around.

778
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,320
However, Xinfang Pavilion

779
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,850
still houses the He family.

780
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,550
We must be more careful in the future.

781
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,280
Just listen.

782
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,000
Bao came early to plead for you,

783
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,900
asking me not to blame you.

784
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,320
As for those in Xinfang Pavilion,

785
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,920
if there's anyone you fancy,

786
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,000
she would never compete with her sisters.

787
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,800
Personal feelings
don't cloud her judgment.

788
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,360
She puts the Rong family
above everything else.

789
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,880
That's the demeanor
of a true head of household.

790
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,340
You should learn from her.

791
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,150
The order of seniority and respect
must not be disturbed.

792
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,030
On the day of
the Tea Ancestor Festival Ceremony,

793
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,190
Bao will surely choose a worthy husband.

794
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,360
Afterward, you may choose as you wish.

795
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,230
If any of you dare cause another scandal
and become a laughingstock,

796
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,160
I will be the first to not spare you!

797
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,070
Copy 'The Classic of Tea' 100 times

798
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,400
before you see me again.

799
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,310
Grandmother.

800
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,840
Grandmother.

801
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,760
Putting on an act

802
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,550
of being a kind and generous elder sister.

803
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,480
So you already came to Grandmother

804
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,830
to poison her against me.

805
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,290
Now you must be satisfied.

806
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,360
You're incompetent yourself,

807
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,690
yet full of complaints.

808
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,320
You brought this shame upon yourself.

809
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,720
How can you blame others?

810
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,370
I'd rather marry a poor scholar

811
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,190
than someone who fancies a lowly servant!

812
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,980
If we ever share a table in the future,

813
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,090
should he call us masters,

814
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,440
or should we call him brother-in-law?

815
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,150
Shanbao,

816
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,470
you really aren't picky at all.

817
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,070
Master or servant,

818
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,810
it's all up to me.

819
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,440
Yunyin, if you have time

820
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,480
for idle gossip,

821
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,400
you'd better go back to your copying.

822
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,200
You'll probably be working
until midnight today.

823
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,180
You...

824
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,110
Miss Rong.

825
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,240
Miss Rong, something's happened to Mr. Lu.

826
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,990
Enough.
Aren't you embarrassed enough already?

827
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,440
Let her go.

828
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,880
Yunyin, I'll grind the ink for you.

829
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,060
Get lost!

830
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,840
Miss Rong.

831
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,320
Shanbao.

832
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,360
Miss Rong, why are you here?

833
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,000
This is not the place you should be.

834
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,100
Mr. Bai, why didn't you stop her?

835
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,360
Miss Rong.

836
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,230
Fortunately,
he was wearing body armor today,

837
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,430
so the vital organs weren't injured.

838
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,400
However,
the wound looks quite frightening,

839
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,920
better not look at it.

840
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,460
What are you standing there for?

841
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,590
Hurry and change the medicinal cloth.

842
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,700
The sword was poisoned?

843
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,440
Yes.

844
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,760
The sword was laced with arsenic

845
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,620
and monkshood.

846
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,730
If I had arrived even a bit later,

847
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,280
the one lying on the bed

848
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,610
would be a corpse by now.

849
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:24,030
This assailant's intentions
were truly vicious.

850
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,710
Shanbao, don't be upset yet.

851
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,230
Yang Dingchen is too proud of his status,

852
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,590
so he'll certainly deny everything.

853
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,320
We must handle this carefully.

854
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,030
Where is Cheng Guanyu?

855
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,140
Tell him to personally

856
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,510
invite Mr. Yang here.
