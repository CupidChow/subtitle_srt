[Rong Residence]

4
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,039
This is mine.

5
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:38,200
Mine.

6
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,950
-Brother Zhang, please.
-This is mine.

7
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,509
What brings

8
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,950
so many Young Masters here?

9
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,000
It said that the Tea King, Rong Family,
seeks a husband for the daughter.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,680
Really?

11
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,470
The Rong Family
is one of the wealthiest in the land.

12
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,259
I wonder which Young Master will

13
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,509
have the honor of being chosen?

14
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,640
So many people here.

15
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,190
What is this huge crowd doing here?

16
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,660
My Lord.

17
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,570
The Rong family is choosing
a husband for Miss Rong.

18
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,120
The whole Linji is buzzing about it.

19
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,080
Many noble families

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,470
are rushing to the Rong family.

21
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,150
My Lord, it'd be better not to

22
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,870
trouble them

23
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,930
at a time like this.

24
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,400
I shall see for myself

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,230
what manner of house this Rong family is,

26
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,110
that so many are drawn to its gate.

27
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,790
Go surround it.

28
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,320
Yes.

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,160
- Make way!
- Make way!

30
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,170
Make way!

31
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,520
Why are there so many officers?

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,640
Make way! Step back!

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,760
What are you doing?

34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,280
We bear an invitation from

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,750
Magistrate Lu of Chunning County,

36
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,750
humbly requesting the honor of
Lady Rong's presence.

37
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,750
What is this about?

38
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,400
What...What's happening here?

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,960
My Lord.

40
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,060
Are we just going to wait like this?

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,620
Yes.

42
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,130
Until Lady Rong agrees to see us.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,710
His eyes are too small.

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,300
This one's face is longer than a horse's.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,890
Next.

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,060
A bulging brow and sunken eyes--so ugly.

47
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,250
What in the world is this face!

48
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,360
Not good. None of these will do.

49
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,680
They do not good indeed.

50
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,400
Jingyi.

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,050
Return all the birth charts and portraits.

52
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,090
Send away those who came in person too.

53
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,130
Just tell them.

54
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,800
If they want our Rong family's

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,380
precious tea seeds next year,

56
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,540
they should select

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
their finest clansman

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,910
and send them to our place for selection

59
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,700
before the spring tea harvest.

60
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,579
Yes.

61
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,590
Grandmother!

62
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,590
Grandmother!

63
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,460
Grandmother!

64
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,040
Why're you so panic?

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,290
Still so immature.

66
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,510
Those people outside
are causing trouble again.

67
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,790
I've tried repeatedly to persuade them,

68
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,590
but they refused to move an inch.

69
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,320
Check out this.

70
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,310
Take a look.

71
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,090
How insolent!

72
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,070
Madam Yang

73
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,750
clearly had her husband killed.

74
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,510
What does that have to do with
the Rong family?

75
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,260
They demanded a witness for the court,

76
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,140
and we already sent a steward to appear.

77
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,000
We’ve shown them every courtesy.

78
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,750
How dare they expect Grandmother to appear
in court herself!

79
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,460
I heard that

80
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,900
the newly appointed Magistrate Lu

81
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,700
seems to be

82
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,140
Minister Xu's
prized protégé from the capital.

83
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,400
He's pretty arrogant.

84
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,580
That Prefect Xu demanded double

85
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,750
the usual tribute from

86
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,410
our tea plantation last year,

87
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,510
but Grandmother refused him outright.

88
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,550
It seems this year

89
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,670
he wants to use this young magistrate

90
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,510
to test the Rong family's background.

91
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,310
Prefects and Governors

92
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,020
come and go like revolving lanterns,

93
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,430
yet our Rong family has stood firm
in Linji

94
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,290
for centuries.

95
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,020
A mantis cannot block
the path of a mighty cart.

96
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,990
With the county exams approaching,

97
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,580
all we need is

98
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,670
to anonymously circulate
a few inflammatory posters

99
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,220
and encourage the students
to petition for a boycott,

100
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,880
which'd be enough
to make Governor Jiang yield.

101
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,130
What do you think, Bao'er?

102
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,870
I see three problems with this plan.

103
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,900
First,

104
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,870
the Rong family'd inevitably be suspected
of coercing the Governor,

105
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,780
thus handing others
a ready-made accusation.

106
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,630
Second, it'd delay the students from
taking the exams,

107
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,090
going against
Grandmother’s intention of supporting

108
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,950
poor students to benefit the community.

109
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,700
Thirdly,

110
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,310
in the eyes of ordinary citizens of Linji,

111
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,900
the Rong family'd become
unscrupulous gentry

112
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,380
who incited examination boycotts

113
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,110
and disregarded law and order.

114
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,310
Haven't we been supporting
those poor students

115
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,190
all along precisely for
such a critical time?

116
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,070
If we hesitate and waver now,

117
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,950
won't Grandmother end up
being publicly questioned in court

118
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,550
under the gaze of thousands?

119
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,750
Don't forget that

120
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
the Wei family's tea plantation,

121
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,780
though now entirely owned
by the Yang family,

122
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,110
their ancient tea trees

123
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,200
are rooted in the Rong family garden.

124
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,750
Who knows what the people of Linji

125
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,670
will say.

126
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,870
Indeed.

127
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,700
If you're really so capable,

128
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,030
why don't you
come up with a good solution?

129
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,590
I certainly won't let him

130
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,760
act so recklessly in the Rong family.

[Rong Residence]

132
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,460
We bear an invitation from

133
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,190

134
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,190
humbly requesting the honor of
Lady Rong's presence.

We respectfully request
the prescene of Lady Rong!

136
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:55,110
What's happening with the Rong family?

137
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,630
I heard they're harboring a runaway woman

138
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,070
and sheltering criminals.

139
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,040
Who doesn's know Lady Rong's character?

140
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,070
Without any evidence,

141
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,340
isn't this just nonsense?

142
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,550
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

143
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,680
Complete nonsense!

144
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,460

It's been three days already.

The Rong family seems to be
carrying on as usual,

147

no sign of any unusual activity.

148

The whole Linji is talking about
this matter.

149
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,070
I don't believe that Lady Rong

150
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,330
can remain so calm as if nothing happens.

151
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,360

then you can just investigate.

But who allowed you
to provoke the Rong family?

how can you be controlled

00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,030
The stipend scholars
of Linji,

190
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,030

indignation for Lady Rong,

191
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,950

192
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,620
When the students heard of this,

193
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,909
they gathered outside County Office,

194
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,370
appealing to
Your Excellency to intervene.

195
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,580
Let me ask you.

196
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Without guarantees from stipend scholars,

197
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,640
how can students enter the exam hall?

198
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,580
What about the county examination?

199
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,840

prefectural and provincial exams?

200

201

If one could become

373
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,780
the Rong family's son-in-law,

374
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,440
wouldn't that be like
falling into a pot of gold?

375
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,360
Bai Yingsheng from Wanfeng Academy.

376
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,430
This Young Master is so handsome!

377
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,250
[Yang Dingchen]

378
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,500
Mr. Yang,

379
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,080
please wait in the Flower Hall for tea.

380
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,780
How grand, isn't it?

381
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,830
Look how many there are!

382
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,590
Are you recommended by Principal Liu?

383
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,740
Please.

384
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,830
Who is this Young Master?

385
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,830
So extravagant!

386
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,120
Look at this TYoung Master.

387
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,800
[He Xingming]

388
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,150
Mr. He.

389
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,210
He Xingming from Huqiu

390
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,000
has come to propose to Miss Rong.

391
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,240
I was wondering who it was.

392
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,670
Didn't the He family boast

393
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,700
that their Huqiu Tea of Mountain Wu
is the best in the world

394
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,740
and vow to surpass the Rong family?

395
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,910
How come Mr. He has stooped so low

396
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,040
as to come begging for their tea seeds?

397
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,060
When my family's Huqiu Tea

398
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,430
was renowed throughout the world,

399
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,870
Yangxian, Tianchi,

400
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,630
Beiyuan and Songluo

401
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,110
were content to be mere inferiors.

402
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,700
The Rong family's Longjing tea

403
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,670
wasn't even known by anyone

404
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,270
back then.

405
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,590
How come our Young Master
isn't good enough to marry her?

406
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,830
Events from just a decadee ago
are too shameful to recall,

407
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,910
and yet you dare trumpet achievements

408
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,630
from a hundred years back?

409
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,700
She is mine.

410
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,630
Young Masters, you must
be weary from your journey.

411
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,090
Please, take your rest
at Xinfang Pavilion.

412
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,540
This courtyard has a beautiful view.

413
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,350
Yes, indeed.

414
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,670
Look over there.

415
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,780
How exquisite. Look, Young Master.

416
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,390
Guess who I am?

417
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,330
Cousin, stop fooling around.

418
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,630
Bao'er, you must have eyes

419
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,260
in the back of your head.

420
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,350
How many times have I told you

421
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,550
to call me Xiangling?

422
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,700
Weren't you studying at the academy?

423
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,740
Why did you suddenly come here?

424
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,670
Does Uncle know?

425
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,500
If I didn't come,

426
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,020
[Wen Can]

427
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,390
and let someone arrange your marriage,

428
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,020
wouldn't I regret it

429
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,280
for the rest of my life?

430
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,390
I'm here to win.

431
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,540
You won't win.

432
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,020
You don't want

433
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,030
a childhood sweetheart,

434
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,980
but you insist on choosing from
a bunch of strangers

435
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,440
with unknown intentions?

436
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,310
Bao'er, you're so confused.

437
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,540
Miss Rong,

438
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,260
all Young Masters have all arrived
at the mansion.

439
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,220
Are you really not going to take a look?

440
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,060
Silly girl.

441
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,410
Xiangling already has me by her side.

442
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,090
Years ago,

443
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,770
my aunt fled to the Wen family,

444
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,780
and she was grateful that
my father gave her some soup.

445
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,270
They then became sworn siblings.

446
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,590
When the Wen family declined later,

447
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,980
she'd often bring me

448
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,250
to play with you.

449
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,000
We may be family by oath,

450
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,740
but we're closer than most real family.

451
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,330
You are my cousin
who was raised in luxury,

452
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,630
being so innocent and sincere.

453
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,220
When've you ever experienced
harsh realities in life?

454
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,040
Once you've experienced

455
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,740
the fierce competition for victory,

456
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,630
then come and speak your heart to me.

457
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,190
Then please await the good news,
Xiangling.

458
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,510
Keep a close eye on him.

459
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,440
I understand.

460
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,040
Don't worry, Miss.

461
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,190
They've sent dozens of troublemakers today

462
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,870
without a thought for

463
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,600
whether we can handle them all.

464
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,470
Hey, the new one!

465
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,510
You need to hurry.

466
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,440
If it rains tomorrow,

467
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,980
this stench will spread for miles.

468
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,780
By then, if it bothers those noble guests,

469
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,310
you'll be beaten with a rod.

470
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,980
Move it! Move it!

471
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,670
You...You!

472
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,900
Get that out of my way!

473
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,350
You're really asking for a beating.

474
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,540
The horses eat fresh grass

475
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,190
delivered from the meadows every day.

476
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,250
Fresh horse dung should be greenish.

477
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,910
Only these few horses have droppings

478
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,910
as hard as stones.

479
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,830
These horses also look listless.

480
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,910
We should find someone
who can treat sick horses.

481
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,910
This is from being driven too hard
on the road

482
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,300
without feeding them enough water.

483
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,230
What do you know?

484
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,150
Miss Rong is kind-hearted

485
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,320
to give you those few bowls of leftovers,

486
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,830
but don't think you're something special?

487
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,700
Mr. Wen brought

488
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,870
these prized horses from Northern Ji

489
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,460
are fed only the finest fodder.

490
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,800
Who'd dare let anything happen to them?

491
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,150
If you dare talk nonsense again,

492
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,630
I'll report you to the steward.

493
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,630
Then they'll pin you to the ground

494
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,350
and give you thirty lashes first.

495
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,450
What are you waiting for?

496
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,530
Before sunset,

497
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,980
hurry and take those vats of

498
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,870
fermented manure

499
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,680
to the garden.

500
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,260
Hurry up!

501
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,110
Dillydallying...

502
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,950
It's not worth arguing with

503
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,350
such a fool over nothing.

504
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,500
I must find out from Miss Rong

505
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,870
about my background and identity.

506
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,930
Then I can leave this wretched place.

507
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,260
Brother Yang.

508
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,070
The host hasn't invited us yet,

509
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,780
but we're sneaking into this garden.

510
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,710
I'm afriad if this is appropriate.

511
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,000
We're not animals that

512
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,190
they can keep us in Xinfang Pavilion,

513
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,910
and only give us some water and grass.

514
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,370
The Rong family never said

515
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,460
we couldn't stroll in their garden.

516
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,940
Besides, with Brother Yang here today,

517
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:45,950
which one of those

518
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,340
arrogant servants would

519
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,200
dare to stop us?

520
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,010
Yes, yes, yes.

521
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,430
We're just following

522
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,830
to broaden our horizons.

523
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,590
When it comes to

524
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,350
who is most deserving of Miss Rong's hand,

525
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,540
Brother Yang is without a doubt the man.

526
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,430
But I've heard the Rong family's

527
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,800
marriage traditions are different.

528
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,580
They don't allow formal engagements
or wedding banquets.

529
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,500
But if the marriage
doesn't work out later,

530
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,540
even a son-in-law
who has entered the Rong household

531
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,870
will be immediately
sent back to his family.

532
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,780
The Rong family's search for a son-in-law

533
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,910
was an old story from thirty years ago.

534
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,740
It's only natural that ordinary folk

535
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,950
wouldn't know the details.

536
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,830
Yangs are a prominent family in Linji.

537
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,360
Even if others are unaware,

538
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,850
how could Brother Yang possibly not know?

539
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,110
I was just about to ask Brother Yang.

540
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,670
Is it real that
the Rong family is run by women?

541
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,250
Is it true that
women are superior to men?

542
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,910
In years past, when the couple fell out,

543
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,630
did they truly set a precedent by

544
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,020
"removing the father
and keeping the offspring"?

545
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,830
And what exactly is this "Tea Bone"

546
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,500
that's been passed down
through the generations?

547
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,560
Has the Rong family's immense wealth

548
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,430
truly fallen on

549
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,740
Miss Rong's shoulders alone?

550
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,050
If you're fortunate enough to become
the Rong family's son-in-law,

551
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,510
you'll naturally know
what you need to know.

552
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,470
I'm afraid you don't have such luck,

553
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,670
so why bother asking?

554
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,260
I'm just curious, that's all.

555
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,350
Although we have some wealth,

556
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,820
compared to the Rong family,
it's like a drop in the ocean.

557
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,830
But you, Brother Yang,
with your impressive wealth,

558
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,190
why do you also come
to join this excitement?

559
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,450
None of your business.

560
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,430
Yes.

561
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,520
Your criticism
is most enlightening, Brother Yang.

562
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,240
You thieving beast!

563
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,590
What are you looking at?

564
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,390
Where did this filthy trash come from?

565
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,220
How dare he eavesdrop on our conversation!

566
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,750
I... I'll leave right away.

567
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,540
I am an honored guest invited by
the Rong family.

568
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,870
What is that murmuring!

569
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,870
You bastard!

570
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,440
Showing no respect at all!

571
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,290
Clean my shoe!

572
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,300
Young Master Wang, please don't be angry.

573
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,110
I... I...

574
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,950
I'll clean them for you right away.

575
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,490
Wang what?

576
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,980
No wonder he's carrying manure.

577
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,220
It turns out he's half-deaf.

578
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,020
Brother Wang,

579
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,740
don't bother arguing with a deaf guy.

580
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,740
It'll be a disgrace to your dignity.

581
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,100
Wang Lu, tell him to leave quickly.

582
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,060
Wang Lu.

583
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,280
Fine. I'll remember you.

584
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,540
Get lost now!

585
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,980
Are you waiting for a slap?

586
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,060
Who?

587
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,480
Even before you beat a dog,
you should need to know who its master is.

588
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,340
Our Rong family isn't a place
for you to make a scene.

589
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,050
Miss Rong, please don't be angry.

590
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,950
My friend here acted rashly

591
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
and offended you.

592
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:45,890
Wang Lu,

593
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,460
hurry up and apologize to Miss Rong.

594
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,640
Please forgive me, Miss Rong.

595
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,190
I heard everything

596
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,230
you just said.

597
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,730
In the Rong family,

598
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,790
if someone is looked down upon,

599
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,980
it's never because he is a man,

600
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,870
but because he lacks intelligence,

601
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,110
has poor characters,

602
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,480
and fails to serve his family loyally.

603
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,390
When a woman can manage the household
and pursue a career,

604
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,520
it's not simply because she is a woman,

605
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,630
but because she possesses
both virtue and talent,

606
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,290
earning everyone's respect.

607
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,350
This talk of male superiority

608
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,670
or female superiority

609
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,190
is something I've never heard before.

610
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,500
The Rong family has always disdained
such discussions.

611
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,220
Allow me to ask our guests
to respect our traditions

612
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,300
and refrain from
such disrespectful remarks.

613
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,740
We were all ignorant

614
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,060
and spoke arrogantly.

615
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,590
It's all my fault.

616
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,020
Knowing it was our first meeting,

617
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,630
I refrained from speaking bluntly

618
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,960
to avoid offending you.

619
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,900
Please forgive my impropriety, Miss Rong.

620
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,280
Mr. Wang has a hot temper

621
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,760
and has frightened you.

622
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,360
Take this to calm yourself.

623
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,090
Duplicitous and self-destructive.

624
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,950
This kind of guy
is treacherous to the core.

625
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,260
If Miss Rong marries him,

626
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,460
the Rong family line will come to an end.

627
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,750
Thank you for your generosity,
Young Master.

628
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,920
Alright, show them out.

629
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,430
Miss Rong.

630
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,020
It's all because of this wretched beast

631
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,460
who made me

632
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,060
lose face in front of Miss Rong!

633
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,990
-I...
-Mr. Wang.

634
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,950
We're hosting a banquet today
at Xinfang Pavilion

635
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,460
for distinguished guests.

636
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,660
If you don't go back now, you'll be late.

637
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,800
All Young Masters,

638
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,870
please.

639
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,250
Lovely as the peony in spring,

640
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,630
yet cold as the steel that scours bone.

641
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,300
You stepped in with your feigned defense

642
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,300
after I'd already endured
all the scolding and blows.

643
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,300
No way.

644
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,230
I need to see you privately

645
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,960
to get a clear explanation.

646
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,700
Miss, I think you're overthinking.

647
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,230
He really did hurt his head.

648
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,350
Otherwise, with his usual scheming nature,

649
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,010
how could he allow others
to bully him like this?

650
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,690
Time reveals a person's true nature.

651
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,760
Did he stumble
into it by accident,

652
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,440
or deliberately sneak in?

653
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,010
We'll figure that out one day.

654
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,640
If he has ulterior motives,

655
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,990
he'll suffer the consequences.

656
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,320
Send him a bottle of medicine.

657
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,320
Miss.

658
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,500
Reviving Hall's "Corpse-Reviver Elixir"

659
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,949
costs a hundred taels per pill,

660
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:17,150
which is more than a decade of his wages!

661
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,380
You're certainly being generous.

662
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,909
Then give him one pill only,

663
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,139
in case he dies

664
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,790
and wastes my two old ginseng roots.

665
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,310
So many people are after
the Rong family fortune

666
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,570
and Miss Rong herself.

667
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,429
Only if we two join forces
against our enemies

668
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,489
do we have
a slight chance of success.

669
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,030
So you're saying

670
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,980
you want to form an alliance with me?

671
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,620
At tonight's the Rong family banquet,

672
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,389
I shall first offer you
my pledge of loyalty

673
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,909
as the proof of my good sincerity.

674
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,040
How does that sound?

675
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,330
Young Master,

676
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,620
hosting a banquet is one thing,

677
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,430
but why'd the Rong family

678
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,100
consider it necessary

679
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,460
to provide such beautiful companions?

680
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,040
The royal family, to avoid choosing
the wrong groom for the princess,

681
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,230
always sends palace maids to test
the groom before the wedding.

682
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,360
The Rong family is a prestigious clan.

683
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,900
They want to test their future son-in-law.

684
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,270
I dare to guess,

685
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,140
if a Young Master is
fortunate enough to get chosen,

686
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,270
it may well depend on

687
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,090
whether the maid is willing to

688
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,820
put in a good word for him
before the hostess.

689
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,830
Let's have another drink.

690
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,350
With a beauty here to warm and serve wine,

691
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,310
even if I don't win Miss Rong's hand,

692
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,020
I can still count the evening well spent.

693
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,860
This trial by wine and beauty will prove

694
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,430
who is clear-headed enough

695
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,430
for what comes next, the real tests.

696
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,030
Let's apply a bit of pressure

697
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,750
and help wash away

698
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,410
a few unworthy grains of sand.

699
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,950
This is excellent wine.

700
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,270
Have some more, Young Master.

701
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,470
Yes, yes, no problem.

702
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,340
I really can't drink anymore.

703
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,660
Mr. Wen.

704
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,980
With the host's wine,

705
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,240
let me first propose a toast to you.

706
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,140
Mr. Wen, why are you

707
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,800
drinking jasmine wine alone?

708
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,790
Young ladies may favor
its floral sweetness,

709
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,750
but it's a bit too mild for our tastes.

710
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,460
Here, try this Autumn Dew White.

711
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,800
Here, Brother Wang,

712
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,450
let me toast to you.

713
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,060
Today, two friends of mine

714
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,990
accidentally offended Miss Rong.

715
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,960
They feel deeply regretful

716
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,850
and I was hoping
you could help smooth things over.

717
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,400
Here.

718
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,480
Young Master, you worry too much.

719
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,310
Mr. Wen.

720
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,270
Your two families are so related.

721
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,140
Since you'll be
visiting each other often in the future,

722
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,540
I hope we may
call upon your kindness often.

723
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,140
Mr. Wen, such small cups
are no way to enjoy a drink!

724
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,950
Let's switch to bigger cups.

725
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,910
-Come on, Mr. Wen.
-No, no, thanks.

726
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,370
Come on.

727
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,280
Come.

728
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,910
Here, come.

729
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,500
-Let me fill your cup.
-Mr. Wen.

730
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,300
Let's all have a drink together.

731
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,580
We won't leave until we're drunk tonight.

732
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,170
Brother Bai.

733
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,230
Let's just enjoy our drinks.

734
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,790
Brother Bai, we've not finished yet.

735
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,660
Exactly. I have a fine piece of

736
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,500
calligraphy at my place.

737
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,180
Let's go to my place.

738
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,180
-No, no.
-Let’s go.

739
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,950
-Let's go.
-Come on.

740
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,950
-Bottoms up.
-No need.

741
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,500
Really, there's no need.

742
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,540
Let's go, Brother Bai.

743
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,910
Drink.

744
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,570
Bottoms up.

745
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,010
Bottoms up.

746
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,640
Come on.

747
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Good tolerance.

748
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,530
Here, let me fill your cup.

749
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,870
Slow down.

750
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,830
Don't rush. Let me close the door first.

751
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,180
Who are you?

752
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,600
What are you doing?

753
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:21,840
Who is it?

754
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,620
You drive away and beat
your guests for no reason.

755
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,720
How can you justify this?

756
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,390
-That’s right.
-Yeah.

757
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,830
I want to speak to Miss Rong about this.

758
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,140
Our Rong family meant to kindly host

759
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,140
guests from afar.

760
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,640
But we don't treat lecherous scoundrels.

761
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,710
We served you with good wine and meat,

762
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,370
but we've fed a bunch of swine!

763
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,790
How dare you get drunk
and harass our maids?

764
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,190
Have you lost your minds?

765
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,540
One more word out of any of you,

766
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,500
and you'll be tied up
and hauled to the County Office,

767
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,700
Let them have your backs beaten to pulp!

768
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,180
But...

769
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,420
Didn't your family mention
a trial marriage?

770
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,540
What trial?

771
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,740
Trial your fool head!

772
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,950
Have you been swilling so much wine

773
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,350
that your mouth spews filth?

774
00:38:59,350 --> 00:38:59,980
You're not fit to so much as hand me,

775
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,100
a maid's slippers,

776
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,390
let alone aspire to

777
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,060
our Miss!

778
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:03,980
I...

779
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,660
You...

780
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,790
Get lost!

781
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,610
Leave quickly.

782
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,330
How embarrassing.

783
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,060
Go!

784
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,500
Pah!

785
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,460
Fourth Miss,

786
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,650
Miss Rong's courtyard

787
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,100
never allows unauthorized entry.

788
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,460
While no one notices,

789
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,270
let's leave quickly.

790
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,350
The new tea is about to harvest,

791
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,230
Rong Shanbao is holding a meeting
at Chongxi Hall.

792
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,140
All attendants around her
were assigned to leave here.

793
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,470
How could she pay attention to this place?

794
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,320
It's tricky as someone is guarding there.

795
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,170
I want to see Miss Rong.

796
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,020
Could it be that someone else

797
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,680
is also looking for Miss Rong?

798
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,140
Oh no!

799
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,110
I forgot to apply the honey.

800
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,020
Rong Shanbao

801
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,790
really did hide you here.

802
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,320
[Sixth Miss of the Rong family,
Rong Yunwan]

803
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,490
You know what to do?

804
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:50,830
Yes, yes, I understand.

805
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,500
I won't let this stand in the way of
your important work, Young Master.

806
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,980
But if others find out...

807
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,430
Even if all of my ten fingers

808
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,460
were put in finger crushers,

809
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,800
it'd be due to his own lust and folly,

810
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,860
and he deserved it.

811
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,230
To be a son-in-law of the Rong family,

812
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,270
one must first maintain proper conduct.

813
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,270
Wen Can was drunk and misbehaved tonight,

814
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,430
how could Miss Rong still want him?

815
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,230
After all the commotion this evening,
I can't sleep at all.

816
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,760
Let's go.

817
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,100
Come to my room for some chess games.

818
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,070
Please.

819
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,910
This is terrible.

820
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,860
Wanwan, what are you afraid of?

821
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,260
I'm your sister.

822
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,930
I won't bite you.

823
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,020
Come here.

824
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,970
Come here quickly.

825
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,390
It's been a while.

826
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:03,950
You idiot have finally

827
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,350
grown some brains.

828
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,080
It's not as easy
to fool as you used to be.

829
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,310
Fourth Sister is mean!

830
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,310
-Fourth Sister is so fierce.
-Stay still.

831
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,180
Let me go!

832
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,710
Let go!

833
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,710
Why are you running?

834
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,830
You ill-fated scourge,
who doomed your own mother!

835
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,690
How many more people in my family
do you want to harm?

836
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:00,340
[Tea Tax]

837
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:01,790
That Prefect Xu demanded

838
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:02,950
double the usual tribute

839
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,460
from our tea plantation last year.

840
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:04,700
Tea tax was one of
the ancient government's

841
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,740
[Hand over the tea tax!]

842
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,100
most important sources of revenue.

843
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,500
[Abuse of power? Shackle/Exile!]

844
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,620
The Ming Dynasty's tea tax

845
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,140
was administered on a regional basis.

846
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,460
The Sichuan region implemented
the Official Tea System

847
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,740
to facilitate the tea-for-horses trade

848
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,270
with frontier tribes for horses.

849
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,460
While Jiangnan region

850
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,020
adopted the merchant tea system.

851
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,620
Under the Tea License System,

852
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,680
merchants paid
corresponding taxes

853
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,580
for selling tea for profits.

854
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,830
Ming Dynasty's tea taxation system

855
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,580
was a product of political prioritization.

856
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,500
Its primary design objective

857
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,910
was to consolidate border security

858
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,180
rather than to generate revenue.

859
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,140
The paradox of low tax rates

860
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:37,000
coupled with strict control
ultimately led to depressed tax yields.

861
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,500
Although the tea-for-horses trade

862
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,100
helped maintain frontier stability,

863
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,500
it failed to translate effectively

864
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,020
into a fiscal advantage.

865
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,070
Instead, it created fertile ground

866
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,220
for smuggling and corruption.
