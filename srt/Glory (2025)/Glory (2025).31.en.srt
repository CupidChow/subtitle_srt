00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,720
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,200
Our forebears of every generation
hacked through thorns and brambles,

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,789
building this family through hardship.

5
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:37,560
They've painstakingly managed

6
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,420
the tea plantation for 400 years.

7
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,000
In the past, there were
cases like this as well—

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,710
passing off inferior goods as genuine,

9
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,440
disgracing our family's name.

10
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,150
Father, you remember that, don't you?

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,530
By the Rong family's rules,

12
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,640
you should withdraw
from the clan of your own accord.

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,810
How dare you be so insolent!

14
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,230
Although you grew up

15
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,280
with Grandmother

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,350
and never received

17
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,940
direct parenting from your parents,

18
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,050
you must have studied the classics

19
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,480
and learned proper etiquette

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,150
to understand what is meant by

21
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,960
the proper relationship between ruler
and subject, father and child.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,419
Parents to their children

23
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,870
are like heaven and earth,
vast and mighty.

24
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,910
How can you, a mere daughter,

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,079
dare to speak such

26
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,710
words that defy filial piety?

27
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,590
Even if lightning doesn't strike you dead,

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,850
the contempt of others

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,610
would surely drown you.

30
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,810
Lady Shanbao, filial piety
comes first in life.

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,960
Since ancient times,
parents scolding their children has been

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
perfectly natural.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,470
How could a daughter

34
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,840
criticize her own father?

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,300
This is greatly unfilial.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,150
Quickly apologize to your father.

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,480
If this matter spreads,

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,280
who would dare
take you as a daughter-in-law?

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,610
How could you ever marry

40
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,190
or establish yourself in society?

41
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,000
How could this be

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,810
the behavior of an obedient daughter?

43
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,210
It's truly frightening!

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
You all know about

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,470
the proper relationship between ruler
and subject, father and child.

46
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,870
The ancient saying goes:

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The people are most precious,
the state comes second,

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,520
and the ruler is least important.

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,750
A ruler who deceives his people

50
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,960
cannot last long.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,900
If this applies to a country,
how about a family?

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,910
You sell inferior tea.

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
Damaging the Rong family's
century-old reputation is a small matter,

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,280
but destroying the livelihood
of thousands of tea farmers is serious.

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,610
If this matter spreads,

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,120
those who covet

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,750
the Rong family's business

58
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,290
will show you no mercy.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,960
Tea farmers come
from deep in the mountains,

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,190
with free spirits and fierce courage.

61
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,560
Whoever dares to starve them

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,030
will face machetes and hoes—

63
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,970
they will cut off his head
and destroy his roots.

64
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,120
Even I

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,430
cannot stop them.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,560
You are my father,

67
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,750
but not the father
of thousands of tea farmers.

68
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,079
I can be forgiving,

69
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,190
but they will show no mercy.

70
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,190
Expelling you from the family

71
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,390
is already the most lenient treatment.

72
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,280
It's also for

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,680
your own safety, Father.

74
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,710
Before coming here,
I went to see Grandmother.

75
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,560
Father, do you know

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,690
what Grandmother said?

77
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,560
What...

78
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,280
What did Mother say?

79
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,560
Disgrace! Fool!

80
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,280
Go and bring him back.

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,840
Hang him! I want him hanged!

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,460
I don't believe it.

83
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,800
How could Grandmother

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,200
threaten to kill Father?

85
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,019
He is her own son after all.

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,000
Grandmother is the head
of the family first

87
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,260
and our grandmother second.

88
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,000
Steward Cheng.

89
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,000
This...

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,040
This is...

91
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,270
Old Madam insisted on being carried

92
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,120
and personally opened the ancestral hall

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,630
to report to the ancestors.

94
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,290
She said...

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,310
Before you're expelled
from the family, Old Master,

96
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,909
you must receive 100 lashes
with the iron whip.

97
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,510
But thanks to Lady Shanbao

98
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,240
who repeatedly begged for mercy
on your behalf,

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,100
Old Madam finally granted mercy,

100
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,160
allowing Madam and Master Shanhui

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
to each take 20 lashes in your place.

102
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,350
And Lady Yunzhen,

103
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,740
being still young,

104
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,870
will receive only 10 lashes.

105
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,870
What... What did I do wrong?

106
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
This was all Father and Mother's idea.

107
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,580
What did my brother and I do wrong?

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,100
Why is Grandmother punishing us?

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,480
Grandmother can forgive
a thousand mistakes,

110
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,920
but rats and worms within the family

111
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,040
who ruin our tea business

112
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
are what she hates most.

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,700
Knowing your father was wrong

114
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,780
yet not stopping him

115
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,800
and failing to come to Linji
to inform Grandmother,

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
you must be punished
for betraying the family

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,040
along with him.

118
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,800
How dare you!
Father is an imperial official.

119
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,390
If he deserves punishment,
the court will decide.

120
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,270
Who are you

121
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,120
to inflict such punishment here?

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,750
Just now you were

123
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,280
talking about filial piety

124
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,020
and now you dare to
talk back to Grandmother?

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Grandmother said

126
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,490
Uncle Heting obtained his position
through family influence,

127
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,450
and despite receiving 10,000 taels
of silver annually,

128
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,720
he still wasn't satisfied

129
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,450
and greedily opened tea shops
to make more money,

130
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,750
proving his corruption as an official

131
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,070
and disgracing our family name.

132
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,360
After all, families have their own rules

133
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,070
and clans have their own regulations.

134
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,070
Even the law of the land cannot interfere

135
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,430
when a family disciplines
its unworthy descendants.

136
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,880
If you don't want
to follow clan rules, that's fine.

137
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,790
Just return all the money

138
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,680
that has been spent over these years

139
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
and we'll call it even.

140
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,830
Father, if you refuse to accept this,

141
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,920
Grandmother will go
to the capital to file a petition,

142
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,510
accusing you of being ungrateful

143
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,110
and committing the crime of disobedience.

144
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,640
By then, you would not only
lose your position

145
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,630
but could be sentenced to death.

146
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,000
No! I don't want to!

147
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,700
I don't want to be whipped!

148
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,680
Zhen!

149
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,510
Someone come here!

150
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,190
Zhen!

151
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,120
Zhen!

152
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,310
Let me go!

153
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,310
What are you doing? Release me!

154
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:52,950
Let go!

155
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,800
Silence! No crying!

156
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,040
It's just a few lashes.

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,510
I can endure it.

158
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,330
I cannot bear to watch
Father being punished,

159
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,930
so I must take my leave first.

160
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,080
Oh, right.

161
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,300
Grandmother also said

162
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,159
this house

163
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,890
was purchased by her years ago.

164
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,190
It was originally family property

165
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,140
and shouldn't fall into outsiders' hands.

166
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,159
Father, once you settle everything,

167
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,360
you should move out as soon as possible.

168
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,000
Mother.

169
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,520
My dear mother!

170
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,750
How could you be so cruel

171
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,140
to your own son?

172
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,200
Father!

173
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,179
Heting.

174
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,000
Father!

175
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,480
Stop beating him.

176
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,720
-Father!
-Stop!

177
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,960
Stop it.

178
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,600
Uncle Heting is still her flesh and blood.

179
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,390
Grandmother

180
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,000
is truly ruthless.

181
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,700
Twenty lashes with that iron whip

182
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,300
will tear his skin to shreds.

183
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,670
The Rong family fortune

184
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,400
cannot be destroyed by vermin.

185
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,830
Grandmother is being stern

186
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,310
only to

187
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,960
give the family an explanation.

188
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,670
But it puts you
in a difficult position, Shanbao.

189
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,000
If Father weren't Grandmother's own son,

190
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,780
he wouldn't face
such severe family punishment.

191
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,290
If he weren't the father
of the next family head,

192
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,690
I wouldn't need to handle this personally.

193
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,720
So many eyes

194
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,550
are watching how I deal with this.

195
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,550
It would be easy to pardon him alone.

196
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,210
But for the sake of family sentiment,

197
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,390
to disregard the entire family's interests

198
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,970
and the tea farmers' livelihoods...

199
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,770
In the future,

200
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,480
how could I face our family members

201
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,410
or maintain authority?

202
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,520
Family matters are not the difficult part.

203
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,150
The real trouble lies ahead.

204
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,910
The tea sold by the fake Rongzhai

205
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,790
was all sold

206
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,390
under our family's name.

207
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,040
Lady Shanbao.

208
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,960
Our servants just

209
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,650
questioned the manager
of the fake Rongzhai.

210
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,650
According to him,

211
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,180
not only in the capital

212
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
but new shops
have opened in nearby counties too.

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,910
Just the ones he knows of

214
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,170
number no less than 12.

215
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,150
The managers in the capital all knew,

216
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,720
but due to the Old Master's position,

217
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,450
no one dared send word to Linji.

218
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,880
Uncle Heting is truly reckless,

219
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,870
not even consulting with Grandmother

220
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,470
and causing such a disaster.

221
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,960
So many shops,

222
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,570
and who knows how much tea they've sold.

223
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,440
He can gather
inferior and aged tea easily,

224
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,510
but our family's tea shops

225
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,480
produce a limited amount

226
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,410
of tea each year.

227
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,180
Moreover, this year's
torrential rains and hail

228
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,040
have ruined countless tea crops.

229
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
Outsiders don't know the truth,

230
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,130
but this debt

231
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,150
will all be charged to the Rong family.

232
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,870
This will truly

233
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,800
destroy our family's livelihood.

234
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,030
We must compensate
where we can and make amends.

235
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,560
Money is trivial,
reputation is everything.

236
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,360
If we can't make
full compensation this year,

237
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,820
we'll continue next year.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,630
Yunshu,

239
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
go to the Zhuang, Xu

240
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
and Zhao family tea shops again.

241
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,960
Ask them to arrange

242
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,750
5,000 jin of top-grade tea leaves

243
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,150
for our emergency needs.

244
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,690
Xiu Qiong, go investigate again

245
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,390
who my father...

246
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,540
No.

247
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,310
Investigate who Madam Liu has been
associating with these past 6 months.

248
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:49,880
Yes.

249
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,120
You suspect...

250
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,460
With their courage and ambition,

251
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,790
how dare they open so many new shops?

252
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,240
He doesn't have

253
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,300
that much capital.

254
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,820
There must be someone

255
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,420
scheming behind the scenes.

256
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,000
I'd like to see

257
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,750
exactly who

258
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,640
dares to plot against the Rong family.

259
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,150
Report!

260
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,670
Lady Shanbao,

261
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,140
servants from Duke of Yongguo's Mansion
have delivered a visiting card.

262
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,870
Mrs. Xue has come to pay a visit.

263
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:31,370
[Rong Residence]

264
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,480
Having such an inconsiderate birth father,

265
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,630
if it were anyone else,

266
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,760
they would have fallen apart long ago.

267
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,080
Fortunately she cut
through the mess decisively.

268
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,960
If it had continued for

269
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,130
ten days or half a month more,

270
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,510
it would have become unmanageable,

271
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,710
and Grandmother would have been angry.

272
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,040
What are you thinking about?

273
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,480
Since ancient times,
officials have their ways

274
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
and merchants have theirs.

275
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,370
The Rong family is wealthy.

276
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,820
Ordinary impoverished nobles
who want to associate with us

277
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,840
aren't even worth Grandmother's attention.

278
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,240
But Duke of Yongguo's Mansion
holds real power,

279
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,550
and the old Duke has illustrious
military achievements

280
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,280
with great influence at court.

281
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,000
Mrs. Xue personally
came to visit Shanbao.

282
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,700
I fear they

283
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,720
must have ulterior motives
for condescending to associate with us.

284
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,600
The sun is warm today

285
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
and there's no wind or dust.

286
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,460
Why wear this troublesome thing?

287
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,140
The customs here differ from the south.

288
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,210
In the capital,
women from wealthy families

289
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,610
rarely show their faces in public

290
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,870
or go out for business,

291
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,510
especially

292
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,030
unmarried young ladies.

293
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,240
Even if they just visit temples

294
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,840
twice a month to offer incense,

295
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,370
they will be gossiped about

296
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,590
and criticized for being unruly women.

297
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,690
To make things easier,

298
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,440
we must follow local customs

299
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,370
and bear with it.

300
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,080
Wild bees insist on chasing winter plums,

301
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,400
not fearing their wings might freeze.

302
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,440
Lady Xiangling!

303
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,010
Bad luck! Let's go quickly.

304
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,720
Are you Lady Xiangling?

305
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,150
I have an urgent matter
and need to see Lady Rong Shanbao.

306
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,080
Mr. Lang, you truly have

307
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,390
keen ears and eyes.

308
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,000
We've only been
in the capital for a few days,

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,630
yet you already know everything.

310
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,320
Unfortunately,

311
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
Lady Shanbao is entertaining
important guests.

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,790
I'm afraid she won't be available today.

313
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,620
My apologies for the poor reception.

314
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,020
Please come back another day.

315
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm looking for Lady Shanbao
to save a life!

316
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,550
Whose life?

317
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,730
My Lord.

318
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,030
[Xie Huiqing, Mrs. Xue]

319
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,840
The Rong family
and the Duke of Yongguo's Mansion

320
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,670
have never associated with each other.

321
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,870
Mrs. Xue, I wonder why you

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,460
have suddenly
honored us with her presence.

323
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,660
Lady Shanbao,
there's no need to be so modest.

324
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,030
The Rong Mansion dominates the South,

325
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,510
with a formidable reputation.

326
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,670
Even a provincial Governor,

327
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,770
when arriving in Jiangnan,

328
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,770
must first pay respects to Old Madam Rong.

329
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,050
With such prestige

330
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,240
and benevolence,

331
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,870
you're deeply respected
by the local people.

332
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,600
Not just among Jiangnan clans,

333
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,770
but even among the noble families
in the capital,

334
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,970
many cannot compare.

335
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,460
I apologize for my intrusion

336
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,600
with this visit today.

337
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,260
Please forgive me, Miss Rong.

338
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,200
I see you're straightforward

339
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,840
and not concerned with trivial matters.

340
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,100
So I'll speak frankly.

341
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,460
The reason for my visit

342
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,080
is about my brother.

343
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,500
You mean...

344
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,080
Lu Jianglai.

345
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,820
No.

346
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,750
His true surname is Xue.

347
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,450
What are you saying?

348
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,320
Lu Jianglai
is Duke of Yongguo's biological son?

349
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,750
Yes.

350
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,120
That day, an imperial edict arrived

351
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,220
summoning my lord
to report to the capital immediately.

352
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,630
As soon as he left the palace,

353
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,200
he was immediately

354
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,840
invited to Duke of Yongguo's Mansion.

355
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,540
I waited at the post house for days

356
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,070
but there was no sign of him.

357
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,360
I boldly went to inquire

358
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,030
but was turned away at the door.

359
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,080
If Jun Dai hadn't been clever enough

360
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,280
to send a message out,

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,240
I would still be in the dark
about what happened.

362
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,790
How dare they

363
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,450
detain an imperial official!

364
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,540
Two years ago, the Duke's heir
unfortunately fell from his horse

365
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,740
and became disabled.

366
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,270
The old Duke has been
ill with grief ever since.

367
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,120
The Emperor has sent medicine 3 times

368
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,840
and dispatched imperial physicians,

369
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,100
showing the Duke enjoys imperial favor.

370
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,450
Now he's using filial piety

371
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,910
to force my lord
to return to his ancestral family.

372
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,020
I fear some nobles in the palace

373
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,320
are willing to facilitate this.

374
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,450
After all, that secret imperial edict

375
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,800
came at a suspiciously convenient time.

376
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,710
If he must return to his family, so be it.

377
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,360
It's wealth and honor
falling from the sky.

378
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,340
Why are you so anxious?

379
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,440
For others, it would be a blessing,

380
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,270
but for my lord, it's a bitter hatred.

381
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I fear he would rather die

382
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,390
than acknowledge his ancestry.

383
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,910
They say there's no marriage
without grievances,

384
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,790
no father-son relationship without enmity.

385
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,600
The past grudges and entanglements

386
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,920
are not for me,
a younger generation, to discuss.

387
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,720
But blood ties are hard to sever.

388
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,910
How can he refuse
to acknowledge his father

389
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,240
and his family forever?

390
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,720
Our dynasty rules through filial piety.

391
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,440
If the Duke

392
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,640
is determined enough

393
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,130
to accuse him of defying his father

394
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,360
and disrespecting filial duty,

395
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
he can forget about his official position.

396
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,120
Even if he becomes a common peddler,

397
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,520
he'll still be despised.

398
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,100
What face would
he have left in this world?

399
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,360
Alas, I've said
all the nice words I could,

400
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,280
but he's completely stubborn,

401
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,130
refusing to acknowledge the Duke,

402
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,930
causing chaos in our household.

403
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,880
I've shamelessly come
today to ask for help,

404
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,109
hoping that you

405
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,480
might persuade him.

406
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,859
Mrs. Xue, your words are strange.

407
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,109
This is your family's business.

408
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,960
Why come to my door for help?

409
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,190
Miss Rong, there's no need to pretend.

410
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,170
I'm afraid Secretary Lang

411
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,720
has already come to seek your help.

412
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,440
He didn't go to anyone else,

413
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,020
but specifically came to your chambers.

414
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,330
Surely your relationship

415
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,200
with Lord Lu

416
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,970
is obvious without asking.

417
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,160
The Duke has eyes and ears everywhere,

418
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,550
and has already investigated
my family's situation.

419
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,950
Then you should also know

420
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,030
my engagement with Lord Lu is broken.

421
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,200
We have no further ties.

422
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,130
There is no connection between us.

423
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,570
Which ancestors he acknowledges,

424
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,830
which family temple he worships at,

425
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,160
are all his own affairs.

426
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,400
Mrs. Xue, you've come to the wrong person.

427
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,750
I've just arrived in the capital
and am busy with many matters,

428
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,410
so I cannot entertain guests.

429
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,160
Please see yourself out, Mrs. Xue.

430
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,490
I apologize for not
seeing you to the door.

431
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,600
This engagement isn't something
you can just break off.

432
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,510
The Duke considers you
his daughter-in-law,

433
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,310
so you are the Duke's daughter-in-law.

434
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,640
There's no escaping it.

435
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,720
Your father this year

436
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,250
owes 30,000 jin of tea debt,

437
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,880
which must be giving you quite a headache.

438
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,340
The Duke's Mansion
is willing to intervene.

439
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,880
With the Duke's influence,

440
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,880
all problems

441
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,210
can be easily resolved.

442
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,920
I haven't figured out

443
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,750
my family's accounts out myself,

444
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,750
yet you seem to know them perfectly.

445
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,020
So it seems

446
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,410
you're trying to force my hand.

447
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,350
I apologize for being abrupt.

448
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,620
These words come from me alone.

449
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,960
They are now in your keeping.

450
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,030
How to decide

451
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,270
is up to you.

452
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,450
How can others influence you?

453
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,930
You're busy with important matters.

454
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,060
No need to see me out.

455
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,350
The Duke is at home,

456
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,390
awaiting your favorable reply.

457
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,090
This is outrageous!

458
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,440
I wondered how

459
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,270
this trouble came about so suddenly.

460
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,200
It's all their family's scheming.

461
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,350
The old Duke uses both carrot and stick,

462
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,350
but still failed.

463
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,270
Knowing Lord Lu

464
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,680
is strong-willed
and difficult to manipulate,

465
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,810
and can't be forced.

466
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,200
So he resorts to this scheme,

467
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,480
trapping the Rong family,

468
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,070
which means he's got hold of

469
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,200
Lord Lu's weakness.

470
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,510
To avoid involving you, Lady Shanbao,

471
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,770
Lord Lu will have no choice but to submit.

472
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,110
In others' eyes,

473
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,490
am I really that important

474
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,510
to your lord?

475
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,510
You're certainly someone
very dear to his heart.

476
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,400
All because of Lu Jianglai's involvement.

477
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,500
Who did our family offend?
Who did we provoke?

478
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,160
You shouldn't put it that way.

479
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,910
They've woven their net
and set their trap.

480
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,850
If you hadn't taken the bait,

481
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,050
this disaster wouldn't have happened.

482
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,680
If you must blame someone,

483
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,480
blame Mrs. Rong's endless greed

484
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,350
and Master Rong
allowing his wife to amass wealth.

485
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,750
After all, you can't clap

486
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,920
with just one hand.

487
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,470
You're still going on?

488
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Shanbao, you absolutely cannot go.

489
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,510
That family has ill intentions.

490
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,750
Their methods are ruthless.

491
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,200
They're not to be trifled with.

492
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,460
You must not go under any circumstances.

493
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,680
I must go.

494
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,200
To settle this matter,

495
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,490
we'd have to
run around exhausting ourselves

496
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,770
and owe many favors.

497
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,590
The tea we borrowed this year

498
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,350
will have to be repaid next year.

499
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,350
Whoever tied the knot must untie it.

500
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,530
They've come to us voluntarily,

501
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,410
offering to solve our troubles.

502
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,080
And what's wrong with that?

503
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,940
It's nothing more than

504
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,960
wanting me to act as a mediator.

505
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,860
Lady Shanbao,
I fear they don't want a mediator,

506
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,000
they want to hold you as a hostage.

507
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
Old Duke is a battle-hardened veteran,

508
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,790
ruthless in his actions,

509
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,480
who tolerates no disobedience.

510
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,440
He wants to use this matter
to control the Rong family.

511
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,900
Once he takes you captive,

512
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,370
Lord Lu will have no choice but to comply.

513
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,160
Hostage?

514
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,320
They've schemed so much
to invite me there.

515
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,440
Whether it brings fortune or misfortune

516
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,640
depends on their own fate.

517
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,930
[Imperial Yongguo Mansion]

518
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,940
He threw things again?

519
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,870
Master Jianglai.

520
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,290
A father and son reuniting is

521
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,010
only natural and proper.

522
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,110
The Duke is earnestly
keeping you as a guest.

523
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,640
Even the Empress Dowager

524
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,970
has given her approval.

525
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,940
If you have any grievances,

526
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,160
take them out on us servants.

527
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,820
Beat us or scold us as you wish.

528
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,440
Don't keep your anger

529
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,720
bottled up inside.

530
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,240
Making yourself sick with anger

531
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,200
isn't worth it.

532
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Master Jianglai.

533
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,350
It's not that I refuse
to open the door for you.

534
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,880
Last time when you ran away,

535
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,750
the Duke sent

536
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,030
so many officers and guards,

537
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,590
and they barely managed to find you.

538
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,250
I ended up receiving forty...

539
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,750
Forty lashes.

540
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,870
I haven't fully recovered yet.

541
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,510
Please, stop making trouble.

542
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,080
The Duke said

543
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,280
since you're fond of

544
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,920
the eldest young lady
from Rong Mansion in Linji,

545
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,590
he's gone to invite her here for you.

546
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,350
Mrs. Xue has already gone to invite her.

547
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,610
She'll arrive by noon.

548
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,760
She'll come to keep you company,

549
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,970
and you'll surely feel better then.

550
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,440
Get in here now!

551
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,070
Master Jianglai, what are your orders?

552
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,210
Didn't you say an honored guest is coming?

553
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,480
How can I receive visitors
looking like this?

554
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,440
Yes, yes.

555
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,740
Quickly help Master Jianglai wash up.

556
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,800
So he can welcome the honored guests.

557
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,470
[Rong Residence]

558
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,950
Are you really going?

559
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,480
I've been to deserts and seas,

560
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,740
faced sandstorms and huge waves.

561
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Why would I fear the Duke's Mansion?

562
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,200
Of course I'm going.

563
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,510
Shanbao, don't underestimate them.

564
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,550
Lord Lu may thrive in official circles

565
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,680
like a fish in water,

566
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,160
turning danger into safety,

567
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,960
but at the Duke of Yong's mansion

568
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,510
he can hardly make a move,

569
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,040
all because of filial piety

570
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,540
weighing him down.

571
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,140
If you're going...

572
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,270
What?

573
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,480
You're afraid I'll be dragged down too?

574
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,000
Shanbao, please don't joke.

575
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,680
The customs here

576
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,410
are very different from Linji.

577
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,820
Women are confined at home
and restricted everywhere.

578
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,770
Especially in the inner quarters
of noble houses.

579
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,960
I fear you won't be accustomed to it

580
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,680
and might fall victim to others' schemes.

581
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,200
We do not require you

582
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,750
to send an eight-bearer
sedan chair to receive our lady.

583
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,880
When Lady Shanbao goes out,

584
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,530
our household provides our own carriage.

585
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,200
Why do you send

586
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,920
a cramped little sedan chair
to humiliate us?

587
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,180
Look at this yourself.

588
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,110
The door is so narrow.

589
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,720
One must enter sideways.

590
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,220
It's so low you'd hit your head
the moment you step in.

591
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,200
And once inside,
you'd have to sit all hunched up.

592
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,550
Fine, even if you fit in,

593
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,830
can you sit up straight?

594
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,290
What kind of thing is this?

595
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,170
A prestigious Duke's Mansion

596
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,350
can't even send

597
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,550
a decent sedan chair?

598
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,700
Is this not deliberately insulting?

599
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,310
Madam Shanbao,
please don't be upset.

600
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,110
Nonsense! She's no Madam Shanbao!

601
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,710
She is our eldest young lady.

602
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,640
Lady Rong Shanbao

603
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,590
and our Second Young Master

604
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,960
almost completed their wedding ceremony.

605
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,210
Everyone in Linji knows this.

606
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,310
Then you two

607
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,510
are rightfully

608
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,660
an engaged couple.

609
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,370
If we were in Linji,

610
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,020
our Second Young Master

611
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,350
would marry into the Rong family

612
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,480
and follow the Rong family's customs.

613
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,970
But now that we're in the capital,

614
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,160
we must

615
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,200
follow our Second Young Master's status

616
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,640
and address you as Madam Shanbao.

617
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,650
It is our family tradition

618
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,750
to welcome the bride
in a small sedan chair.

619
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,070
Any woman who becomes
another family's daughter-in-law

620
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,110
must first learn to endure,

621
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,880
to yield, to bear hardship.

622
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,190
Only then can she show her gentle virtue

623
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,670
and refined upbringing.

624
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,200
This sedan chair

625
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,240
was used by Mrs. Xue

626
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,310
in the past.

627
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,240
Though the door looks narrow,

628
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,400
the inside

629
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,270
is quite spacious and comfortable.

630
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,800
Madam Shanbao,
please get in the sedan chair.

631
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,400
Shanbao, I wasn't exaggerating.

632
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,170
You've seen it yourself.

633
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,330
Madam Shanbao.

634
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,390
Madam Shanbao, you mustn't!

635
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,880
If you go like this...

636
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,030
-And when others see it...
-Madam Shanbao.

637
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,240
They'll surely gossip about it.

638
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,980
Madam Shanbao!

639
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,070
Don't block the way.

640
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,510
You...

641
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,010
Depart.

642
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,000
You...

643
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,580
Madam Shanbao!

644
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,790
Madam Shanbao!

645
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,070
Go, hurry up and follow.

646
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,750
Ma'am, you must be joking.

647
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,510
We only have these legs.

648
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,750
How can we keep up with

649
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,070
that magnificent steed?

650
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,070
If you want to catch up,

651
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,670
you'd better go by yourself.

652
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,500
Return to the mansion.

653
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,220
-Close the door.
-You...

654
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,600
You are extremely rude!

655
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Madam, a servant reported

656
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,280
that Miss Rong from Linji

657
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,150
was too proud of her status

658
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,590
and refused to ride
in the sedan chair we sent.

659
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,550
She prepared her own
lavish carriage to visit.

660
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,570
[Ms. Chang, Duchess of Yongguo]

661
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,140
Wanniang.

662
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
Yes, Mother.

663
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,640
You were entrusted by the Old Master

664
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,700
to personally visit this young lady.

665
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,440
In your opinion,

666
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,350
what kind of person is she?

667
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,240
Mother,

668
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,250
I only met Miss Rong briefly,

669
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,790
so I don't yet know her character.

670
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,100
From her appearance,

671
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,270
she seems noble and dignified,

672
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,000
a graceful and beautiful lady.

673
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,270
Is that so?

674
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,960
In this world,

675
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,590
how could there be

676
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,350
a daughter who would banish
her father from the clan?

677
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,810
Even if her father
committed a grave mistake

678
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,150
and disobeyed her grandmother's orders,

679
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,590
as a daughter,

680
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,110
she should kneel and beg again and again.

681
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,420
Even if it meant not eating or drinking,

682
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,480
starving to death,

683
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,550
she should have sought
her grandmother's forgiveness.

684
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,980
But look at her!

685
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,700
From so far away,

686
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,990
she sent a horrible order

687
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,830
to expel his father from the clan.

688
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,030
And she can remain completely unmoved.

689
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,150
One can imagine

690
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,880
how cold-hearted she must be.

691
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,000
I sent a small sedan chair to receive her

692
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,610
precisely to

693
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,100
test her temperament.

694
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,160
If she were respectful and gentle,

695
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,240
a lady who follows proper etiquette,

696
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,750
she would be like you,

697
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,520
arriving in the sedan chair.

698
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,510
But she deliberately changed
to her own carriage,

699
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,510
which was enough to prove

700
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,480
her defiant nature—

701
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,840
a fierce, untamable woman.

702
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,910
I've heard

703
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,840
that in the Rong family from Linji,

704
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,640
the women behave wantonly,

705
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,100
disregarding proper etiquette,

706
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,580
spending their days among men,

707
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,730
speaking and acting without restraint.

708
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,860
Such a woman

709
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,300
would bring misfortune to any family.

710
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,260
The Old Master shouldn't
have brought her into our home.

711
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,420
Mother, you're right.

712
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,410
His Highness acted

713
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,440
to persuade Jianglai
to return home.

714
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,840
Mother, please be patient a little longer.

715
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,290
Don't bother with her.

716
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,390
A virtuous wife
keeps her husband from trouble.

717
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,930
Seductive women without virtue

718
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,330
are nothing but trouble.

719
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,750
I certainly hope

720
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,030
the Old Master gets his way this time.

721
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,750
I don't want this woman

722
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,210
to bring any misfortune
into our household.

723
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,080
Wanniang.

724
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,720
You'd better go welcome her yourself.

725
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,680
Don't let her cause any trouble.

726
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,900
Yes.

727
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,200
Beyond the small willow grove

728
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,870
stands Xianyi Pavilion,

729
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,000
bearing an inscription
personally bestowed by His Majesty.

730
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,350
The Duke once

731
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,080
beat His Majesty at chess here.

732
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,510
The Lansha Hall to the east

733
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,640
was where the Duke

734
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,840
studied in his youth.

735
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,130
On the rockery in the southwest corner

736
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,380
stands the Buyi Pavilion.

737
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,310
You can view maple leaves
in autumn and snow in winter.

738
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,820
The scenery is magnificent.

739
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,020
Past this corner gate

740
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,700
is the inner residence.

741
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,550
Madam Chang is very strict about rules.

742
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,660
I'm afraid...

743
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,480
You don't need to follow us any further.

744
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,870
Lady Shanbao, your status is exalted.

745
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,480
Old Madam repeatedly instructed

746
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,980
and ordered me

747
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,310
to never leave your side

748
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,970
and ensure your safety.

749
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,300
Even if you order otherwise,

750
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,950
I dare not comply.

751
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,810
The kindness of elders

752
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,080
must never be refused.

753
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
I can't ask them to leave either.

754
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,550
Mrs. Xue, please have someone guide them

755
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,370
to the outer courtyard
for temporary accommodation.

756
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,750
The capital is different from our home.

757
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,350
You must behave yourselves.

758
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,680
Don't wander around without reason,

759
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,550
and never disturb the host family.

760
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,000
Yes.

761
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,740
Please follow me to meet the Duke.

762
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,200
He's still breathing,

763
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,510
yet she brings his enemy into the house.

764
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,180
Just to appear as a virtuous wife,

765
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,610
while pushing her husband toward death.

766
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,560
What a black-hearted, shameless woman!

767
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,550
The most virtuous woman in the world?

768
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,240
Bah!

769
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,630
[Xue Yingchuan, Princess Jinxiang]

770
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,720
Please.

771
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,970
In my army, during battle,

772
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,160
killing one enemy
exempts a family from labor service.

773
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,720
Whoever takes an enemy officer's head

774
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,880
will be rewarded with land and a mansion.

775
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,270
Military discipline
has always been strict,

776
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,220
[Loyalty and Filial Piety Endure]

777
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,200
and rewards and punishments just.

778
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,060
The same applies in my household.

779
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,820
Serve diligently,

780
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,560
and you'll be generously rewarded.

781
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,350
Anyone who dares to be negligent

782
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,150
will be punished a hundredfold.

783
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,970
A perfectly good tea tree,

784
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,140
and seven or eight of you
can't keep it healthy.

785
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,250
What use are you then?

786
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,280
Mercy, Your Highness!

787
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,680
Spare us, Your Highness!

788
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,160
I truly don't know

789
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,200
what disease the tea tree has.

790
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,260
I've never seen this disease before.

791
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,850
Mercy, Your Highness!

792
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,920
Stop.

793
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,170
Don't be afraid, Miss Rong.

794
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,960
His Highness has been
rather short-tempered lately.

795
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,380
When servants make small mistakes,

796
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,510
he flies into a rage.

797
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,030
If you could persuade

798
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,840
Master Jianglai to change his mind,

799
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,790
all these problems

800
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,830
would turn from misfortune to fortune.

801
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,490
That would be their blessing.

802
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,250
Go inform the Duke

803
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,040
that Miss Rong has arrived.

804
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,540
Yes.

805
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,860
Your Highness.

806
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
Let me examine

807
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,620
what disease the tea tree has.

808
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,910
Wanniang, please explain to her.

809
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,140
Yes.

810
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,500
Miss Rong.

811
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,640
These tea trees are extremely significant.

812
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,550
They once saved His Highness's life.

813
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,280
Previously,

814
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,640
when His Highness was fighting
in the southwest border,

815
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,700
it was a remote area

816
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,120
with harsh conditions.

817
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,380
Once,

818
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,300
His Highness led 2,000 light cavalry

819
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,520
pursuing enemy forces

820
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,480
when they accidentally
entered a misty forest.

821
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,790
Fog was everywhere,

822
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,070
making it impossible to find direction.

823
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,790
For 7 days and nights,

824
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,200
they couldn't find clean water

825
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,730
and nearly perished there.

826
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,270
Fortunately, His Highness

827
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,130
found more than 10 wild tea trees.

828
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,690
By chewing tea leaves,

829
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,510
they found a chance for survival.

830
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,420
Finally, they found a way
out of the mountains

831
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,620
and returned safely.

832
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,680
Later, His Highness

833
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,360
brought back 6 tea trees.

834
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,400
They were fine for the first 2 years.

835
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,530
But since last year,

836
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,620
the tea trees began to wither and die.

837
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,350
Many tea masters were consulted,

838
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,750
but none could save them.

839
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,020
Near the tea trees,

840
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,190
are there roses planted?

841
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,810
Answer quickly.

842
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,310
Yes.

843
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,870
There are about 10 rose bushes nearby.

844
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,469
They were all

845
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,800
planted by Madam Chang herself back then.

846
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,760
Speaking of those roses,

847
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,210
they bloom rather poorly.

848
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,469
Two have already died.

849
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,420
Black whiteflies
parasitize the back of leaves

850
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,480
and easily cause various tea diseases.

851
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,360
Over time,

852
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,080
just like this tea tree,

853
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,210
not only do leaves yellow and fall off,

854
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,670
but branches also wither.

855
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,040
From a single rose, the disease
can spread through the tea grove,

856
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,370
leaving large numbers of tea plants dead.

857
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,179
To prevent the disease from spreading,

858
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,870
the best solution
is to uproot them completely

859
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,380
and burn them.

860
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,170
Can you cure them?

861
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,030
Yes, I can.

862
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,230
Good.

863
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,230
Then stay here

864
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,030
and treat my tea trees.

865
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,110
Please give me an axe.

866
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,800
Yes.

867
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,330
Your Highness,

868
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,230
you care so much about these tea trees,

869
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,480
but do you know why they're sick?

870
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,410
You just told us.

871
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,930
I'm not deaf.

872
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,930
This disease isn't difficult to treat.

873
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,300
Experienced tea farmers

874
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,830
know how to pick leaves
and prepare medicine.

875
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,400
But once the roots are damaged,

876
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,530
treatment can only help temporarily.

877
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,330
It will eventually wither and die.

878
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,440
That's why the tea farmers you've hired

879
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,640
can't fix the problem

880
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,810
and don't dare tell you the truth.

881
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,840
Your Highness claims
to care for these tea trees,

882
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,700
but it's all about your own whims.

883
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,320
You grow tea trees

884
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,190
without considering
what each variety needs,

885
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,790
doing only what pleases you.

886
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,480
Tea trees grow naturally
on hills and mountains.

887
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,460
Their roots need to grow deep

888
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,960
in warm, moist, sandy loam

889
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,840
to thrive.

890
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,840
You've trapped these tea trees

891
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,450
in small containers,

892
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,060
using heavy clay soil,

893
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,420
placing them
in sunny spots sheltered from wind.

894
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,230
If the tea tree doesn't die today,

895
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,830
it will surely die tomorrow.

896
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,360
Are you showing gratitude

897
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,760
or seeking revenge?

898
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,630
How dare you!

899
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,230
Are you talking about tea

900
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,190
or people?

901
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,850
Your suspicion is correct.

902
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,730
I'm talking about Lu Jianglai.

903
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,660
Miss Rong,

904
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,410
you shouldn't be

905
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,840
so disrespectful before His Highness.

906
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,590
Your Highness has fought
valiantly on battlefields,

907
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,030
achieved remarkable merits,

908
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,320
earning respect from everyone
inside and outside the court.

909
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Who would dare offend your dignity?

910
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,840
However, the Rong family
also has its principles.

911
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,350
Respect others,
and you'll be respected in return.

912
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,610
If you show me respect,

913
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,200
I'll return it tenfold.

914
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,070
But if someone takes advantage,

915
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,580
tries to intimidate,

916
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,060
or bullies others with their power,

917
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,120
then don't blame me for fighting back

918
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,020
and refusing to yield an inch.

919
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,910
What do you dare to do?

920
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,400
Your Highness keeps forcing

921
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,660
Lu Jianglai to submit,

922
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,670
using both threats and bribes,

923
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,400
trying every possible method.

924
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,800
Haven't you considered that

925
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,070
when his fortunes wither

926
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,930
and his mind is consumed

927
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,960
his pride broken and will crushed,

928
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
will he still be

929
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,260
the son you truly want?

930
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,760
I fear by then,

931
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,750
whatever bond you share
will be no different from this tree...

932
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,670
Dying a slow death.

933
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,290
That won't happen.

934
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,570
You have a natural gift for tea.

935
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,570
As long as you're here,

936
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,070
it won't wither and die.

937
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,710
You act very much like
your grandmother did

938
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,770
when she was young.

939
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,920
I can't remember which year it was.

940
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,320
When supplies
were most scarce at the front,

941
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,510
your grandmother led a merchant convoy,

942
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,480
risking great danger

943
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,230
to deliver

944
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,540
200,000 shi of military provisions to me.

945
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
Even to this day,

946
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I haven't forgotten this kindness.

947
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,980
I had wanted to keep

948
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,280
the horses and carts
that transported the provisions.

949
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,590
But then she...

950
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,080
Look here.

951
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,400
She cut a big gash on me.

952
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,570
So many years have passed.

953
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,050
It became a deep scar.

954
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,510
She said her carts were heading north.

955
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,800
The tea stock from that year
hasn't been cleared yet.

956
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,460
You tell me.

957
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,110
A woman so fierce and fearless,

958
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,640
daring in thought and deed,

959
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,990
is one I have seen
only once in a lifetime.

960
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,830
Thankfully she's not my wife,

961
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,280
or I'd be driven mad with frustration.

962
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,570
Her granddaughter
is also quite courageous.

963
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,180
My son is lucky

964
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,380

If you can't convince him,

970
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,270
he'll never

971
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,400

in the Depths of Winter?]

Tibetan butter tea

1025
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,810
is a traditional Tibetan beverage

1026
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,190
originated in China's
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

1027
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,920
with a history of over a thousand years.

1028
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,230
People in highland regions

1029
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,800
need high-calorie foods

1030
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,880
to resist the cold.

1031
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,590
But vegetables are scarce there.

1032
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,840
Tea drinking not only aids digestion

1033
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,000
but also maintains
the body's acid-base balance.

1034
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,510
It compensates for

1035
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,960
deficiencies in the dietary structure.

1036
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,620
In Tibetan areas, tea
is typically made by mixing tea leaves,

1037
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,300
brick tea or Pu'er tea,

1038
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,480
with butter extracted from yak milk

1039
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,630
and salt,

1040
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,320
adding sesame seeds, walnuts

is a product of
Han-Tibetan cultural integration.

1047
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,800
