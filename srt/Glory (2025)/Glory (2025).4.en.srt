[Glory]

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,030
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,520
Wen Can acted flirtatious

4
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,050
and reckless in front of me.

5
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,539
Did you teach him that?

6
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,350
What?

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,039
Wen Can has been pampered since childhood.

8
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,100
He's simple-minded and easy to fool.

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,920
You'd better hope I don't find out

10
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,680
that someone is using him

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,140
for underhanded schemes.

12
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,940
Otherwise,

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,200
I won't let them get away with it.

14
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,970
Miss Rong,

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,260
did you know me before?

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,980
What are you trying to say?

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,640
Miss Rong, if you didn't know me,

18
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,240
why did you

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,630
judge me with such malice?

20
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,120
You...

21
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,120
How dare you!

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,500
What kind of person

23
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,590
do you think you are?

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,120
I don't know.

25
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,550
I don't remember my past.

26
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,950
I don't remember who I am either.

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,750
Miss Rong,

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,350
if you really don't trust me,

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
why not transfer me from Mr. Wen's side

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,660
to Qilan Garden

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,730
so that you can keep an eye on me?

32
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,560
Miss Rong.

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,160
You may go now.

34
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,920
Don't you like this whip?

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,040
I said

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,730
I wouldn't accept gifts this time.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,750
This whip

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,380
is very handy for hitting people.

39
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Mr. He.

40
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,100
Our Rong family has our own rules.

41
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,090
You cutting out his tongue

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,310
was going too far.

43
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,870
Miss Rong.

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,130
That idiot tea merchant

45
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,680
was planning revenge
against you last night.

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,030
You ought to thank me.

47
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,300
Mind your own business.

48
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,210
Step aside!

49
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,700
You don't remember anything at all?

50
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,280
What?

51
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,030
Miss Rong,

52
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,040
you're so cold-hearted.

53
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,720
Why didn't I get a return gift?

54
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Shanbao clearly said

55
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,920
everyone would get a return gift!

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,040
Mr. Wen, Miss Rong said
you didn't send anything,

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,070
so there was no need for a return gift.

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,320
Who said I didn't send a gift?

59
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,050
I clearly...

60
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,870
I...

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,390
You may go now.

62
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,560
You go stand guard outside Qilan Garden

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,390
and find out who Shanbao

64
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,680
is having dinner with tonight.

65
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,540
Unless it's me,

66
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,390
don't let anyone in.

67
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,720
Me?

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,190
Stop others?

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,480
Shanbao said you're very capable.

70
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,240
You can definitely do it.

71
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,830
Hurry up!

72
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,480
Hurry up!

73
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,630
Go now!

74
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,830
Miss Rong,

75
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,480
Steward Cheng came to ask

76
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,090
who should be invited to join for dinner.

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,420
Bai Yingsheng.

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,870
Yes.

79
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,050
Why are you here?

80
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,360
Mr. Wen sent me here.

81
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,720
Why did he send you here?

82
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,830
Mr. Wen

83
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,690
asked me to stand guard here

84
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,190
to chase away other young masters

85
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,320
who come for dinner.

86
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,010
You can go back now.

87
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,600
Miss Rong, you told me to go back,

88
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,720
but Mr. Wen told me not to.

89
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,190
This isn't the first time

90
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,920
I've been caught in the middle.

91
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,630
Miss Rong, please tell me exactly

92
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,360
whose orders

93
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,280
I should follow from now on.

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Follow my orders.

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,600
Okay.

96
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,580
Miss Rong, if you don't like it,

97
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,120
you don't actually have to choose anyone.

98
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,970
Sorry that I spoke out of turn.

99
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,850
You didn't just speak out of turn.

100
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,390
You eavesdropped
on your master's conversation.

101
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,160
I dare not.

102
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,950
I only overheard a little bit

103
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,680
by accident.

104
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,000
I just...

105
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I just feel sorry for you, Miss Rong.

106
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,070
Mr. Bai,

107
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,630
my young lady invites you to dinner.

108
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,560
Very well. I'll be right there.

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
I thought the dinner

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,040
was supposed to be held at Qilan Garden.

111
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,720
Mr. Bai,

112
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,870
are you that eager

113
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,600
to visit Shanbao's courtyard?

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,730
Greetings, Fourth Young Lady.

115
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,930
Please sit down. The food is getting cold.

116
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,560
Was it the Fourth Young Lady

117
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,290
who asked you to invite me here?

118
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:10,830
What?

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,630
Do you really think

120
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,560
it was Shanbao who invited you?

121
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,270
I kindly invited you to dinner.

122
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,680
Why the long face?

123
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,070
Do you think

124
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,730
I'm inferior to Rong Shanbao?

125
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,440
I dare not.

126
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,630
Fourth Young Lady, you're so stunning

127
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,150
that no one dares to look directly at you.

128
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,000
But I came here specifically

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,909
to compete for the position
as Miss Rong Shanbao's husband.

130
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,120
So I dare not be wavering

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,980
in my devotion.

132
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,440
I have let down your kind intentions,
Fourth Young Lady.

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,500
Please forgive me.

134
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,230
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
Did you hear that just now?

136
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,480
I originally wanted you to see

137
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,960
that idiot make a fool of himself.

138
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
But in the end,

139
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,320
I was the only one who got worked up!

140
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,840
Yunyin, don't be angry.

141
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,320
There's plenty of time ahead,

142
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,780
so there's no need to rush.

143
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,600
Whoever

144
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,200
has crossed me

145
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,780
will pay for it!

146
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,040
Miss Rong,

147
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
I got there a little too late.

148
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,280
The Fourth Young Lady

149
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,350
sent for him first.

150
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,320
I wasn't sure what to do,

151
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
so I came back to ask for your orders.

152
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,200
Should we

153
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
have him brought back?

154
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,200
No need.

155
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,300
Let her have her way.

156
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,150
Yes, Miss Rong.

157
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,560
Miss Rong,
shall we have the meal served now?

158
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Is he still there?

159
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,620
He's still kneeling outside.

160
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,180
Tell him to come in.

161
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,910
Greetings, Miss Rong.

162
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,270
Come in.

163
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,890
Have you learned your lesson?

164
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,370
From now on,
I will be prudent in word and deed

165
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,240
and won't speak out of turn again.

166
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Do you resent me for punishing you?

167
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
As I have said before,

168
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,080
my life and death

169
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,520
are yours to command.

170
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,360
So I am willing

171
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,560
to accept this punishment.

172
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,110
Very good.

173
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,630
Come and serve me.

174
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,460
Steward Cheng,

175
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,030
what kind of treasures could possibly

176
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,290
win Miss Rong's favor?

177
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,530
Sorry that I spoke out of turn.

178
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,360
Miss Rong.

179
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,840
-Miss Rong.
-Miss Rong.

180
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,540
Miss Rong.

181
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,330
Where is your Chinese New Year pouch?

182
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,590
It's been so busy in the household lately.

183
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,190
I forgot to go and collect it.

184
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,220
Steward Cheng.

185
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,680
What is it?

186
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,120
Lady Rong has sent a message.

187
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,390
Tomorrow at 5 AM,

188
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,140
you need to go to the main gate
to welcome Mr. Yan.

189
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,610
Got it.

190
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,270
Yes.

191
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,790
Mr. Yan, you've finally arrived.

192
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,080
Lady Rong has been eagerly awaiting you.

193
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,670
She has been talking about you for days.

194
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,320
Earlier,

195
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,120
she even wanted Miss Rong
to welcome you in person.

196
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,750
[Yan Bailou]

197
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,270
We ran into a landslide
on the mountain road,

198
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,510
which delayed our journey
for several days.

199
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,320
I'm truly sorry
for having made Lady Rong worried.

200
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,650
I hope this hasn't disrupted any affairs
in your household.

201
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,150
Mr. Yan, don't worry.

202
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,120
Other young masters
have only been here for 5 days.

203
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,810
Please come with me into the mansion.

204
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:34,860
[Rong Mansion]

205
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,030
This is...

206
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,880
It's from the Fourth Young Lady.

207
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,790
Please thank the Fourth Young Lady for me.

208
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,050
I'll take my leave now.

209
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,190
This is also from the Fourth Young Lady?

210
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,740
Mr. Bai,

211
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,450
Xiuqiong from Qilan Garden

212
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,010
personally sent this over.

213
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,910
Miss Rong sent me a martial outfit.

214
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,770
Could it be that the next contest is...

215
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,360
Mr. Yang, what are you doing?

216
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,960
Miss Rong, yesterday

217
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,600
you didn't choose anyone to dine with you.

218
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,150
I suppose you, having seen a lot,

219
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,960
wouldn't settle for those trivial things.

220
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,910
I just want to ask one last question.

221
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,360
If I win tomorrow,

222
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,510
will you choose me?

223
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,530
We'll talk about it when you win.

224
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,320
I will win!

225
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,910
Because no one

226
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,440
deserves you more than I do!

227
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,880
Bao,

228
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,270
you must remember

229
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,040
that you share

230
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,550
the same ancestral roots
in the Rong family.

231
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,590
A good marriage

232
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,740
can help the Rong family flourish

233
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,040
and prosper forever.

234
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,770
But you're not the only granddaughter
in our family.

235
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,710
If you don't care about this,

236
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,850
there will always be someone who does.

237
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,240
Don't make me worry about you.

238
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,410
What's the fuss about?

239
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,550
It's just a man.

240
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,790
Just pick one who's easy on the eye

241
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,730
and get to know him gradually.

242
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,140
Time will tell

243
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,100
whether he's truly to your liking.

244
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,350
There are so many young masters today.

245
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,550
Which one do you like?

246
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,410
I'll tell Grandmother for you.

247
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,550
The Rong ancestors

248
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,510
established the tea trade
against insurmountable odds

249
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,640
They traversed treacherous waters,
scaled precipitous peaks,

250
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,310
crossed barren deserts
and fought fierce bandits.

251
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,830
A single misstep
would have meant utter destruction.

252
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,030
Without any courage,

253
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,960
how could one be worthy of becoming
the Rong family's son-in-law?

254
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,270
Whoever is the first
to climb to the hanging bridge

255
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,330
and seize the prize

256
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,080
will be the winner in the martial contest.

257
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,830
Those who fall off the bridge
will be eliminated on the spot.

258
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,690
Young Masters,

259
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,700
please be careful.

260
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,110
The bridge pier is so narrow.

261
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,000
It can't accommodate all of us.

262
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,500
I suppose many will be forced to withdraw

263
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,410
before even reaching the top.

264
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,560
Even if one climbs to the top,

265
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,210
there's only one prize.

266
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,200
I will definitely be the winner.

267
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,980
Mr. Wen, I don't want to be the winner.

268
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,580
I just want to stay safe.

269
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
Please show some mercy to me.

270
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,790
Don't worry.

271
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,280
The martial contest begins!

272
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,400
Why haven't they started yet?

273
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,920
-What's going on?
-Exactly.

274
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,320
Planning before acting.

275
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,340
You coward!

276
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,140
The faster they climb,

277
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,800
the more quickly they'll die.

278
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,860
This is the allure of the Rong family.

279
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,990
Look how fiercely they're competing.

280
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,510
Sometimes I truly resent my mother

281
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,720
for insisting on marrying
into another family.

282
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,830
She never stopped to think

283
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,210
that a husband's heart might stray,

284
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,540
and an in-law's face might turn cold.

285
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,920
Once she left the Rong family,

286
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,550
she became

287
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,920
just another bargaining chip
weighed by others.

288
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,720
And because of her choice,

289
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,750
now I am an outsider too.

290
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,350
After all, my surname is different
from yours.

291
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,360
We share the same grandmother.

292
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,310
Whatever your surname is,

293
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,570
you're still my cousin.

294
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,030
Take my advice.

295
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,510
If you don’t want to go through
with the wedding rituals,

296
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,840
just take someone in as a companion first.

297
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,590
What matters is the Tea Bone.

298
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,450
Don't let others get ahead of you.

299
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,550
Look there.

300
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,690
Yunxi,

301
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,610
who do you think will be the winner?

302
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,110
The final winner

303
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,910
will become Shanbao's husband.

304
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,920
Grandmother truly

305
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
has a unique way of choosing people.

306
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,310
Yang!

307
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,570
You're despicable!

308
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,830
Great!

309
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Mr. Yang is truly brave and valiant.

310
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,630
I see no need to continue this contest.

311
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,130
Shanbao, if you're to choose a husband,

312
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,510
who else could it be but him?

313
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,550
Mr. Yang has such a commanding presence

314
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,380
and exceptional courage.

315
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,790
He is truly worthy of you.

316
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,680
Shanbao, he's not worthy.

317
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,340
No rush.

318
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,040
Shanbao, I made it to the top.

319
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,710
Wen Can seems a bit off.

320
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:36,920
You!

321
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,630
Here you are.

322
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,000
Come on, have some water.

323
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,590
Mr. Wen.

324
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,870
Thank you.

325
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,350
The first half ends here.

326
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,830
You!

327
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,040
Stop right there, all of you!

328
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,720
Our Rong family made it clear
from the beginning

329
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,450
that this contest is only
for testing martial skills,

330
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,110
not for fighting to the death.

331
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,110
Young Masters, you must know when to stop.

332
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,570
Whoever disobeys my order

333
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,450
shall also step down and concede defeat.

334
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,590
What's the fun in fighting bare-handed?

335
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,590
Miss Rong has said

336
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,350
that those who made it to the bridge pier

337
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,960
may all enter the second half.

338
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,740
Each of you can select a weapon
of your choice

339
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,670
to make the contest more exciting.

340
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,440
Among all the food and drink
Mr. Wen consumed today,

341
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,840
only the tea was taken
outside the mansion.

342
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,240
Mr. Wen,

343
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,390
let me help you get some rest.

344
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,810
I don't want to rest.

345
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,800
Despicable.

346
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,120
Miss Rong.

347
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,790
Mr. Wen's tea

348
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,120
has been tampered with.

349
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,030
No need to help me up.

350
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,290
I can still keep fighting in the contest.

351
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,960
I have a plan.

352
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,480
Mr. Wen,

353
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,550
Miss Rong noticed you're unwell.

354
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,830
She told me to take you
to get your medicine first.

355
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,760
Then you can continue the contest.

356
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,690
Come with me.

357
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,770
The useless one gets all the sympathy.

358
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,050
They even suspended the contest for him.

359
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,660
That Wen guy

360
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,200
is truly annoying.

361
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,980
We'll see if he even lives long enough

362
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,290
to make it to the end.

363
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,590
Mr. Wen.

364
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,750
Where are we going to get the medicine?

365
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,240
Mr. Wen, let me take a look.

366
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,660
You've been drugged,
so you are weak and exhausted.

367
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,820
Miss Rong asked me to persuade you

368
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,150
not to compete anymore.

369
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,280
It's none of your business.

370
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,370
You must go, even if it costs your life?

371
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,680
Yes, I must go.

372
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:37,940
Miss Rong?

373
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,570
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,770
Mr. Wen, you're so delicate.

375
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,750
After a little head injury,

376
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,270
you're armored

377
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,480
from head to toe.

378
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,320
If you're that scared,

379
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,960
why not go back home

380
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,020
and never come out?

381
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
I'll knock that shell right off you!

382
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,470
If he's so scared,

383
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,570
he should just withdraw from the contest.

384
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,090
Exactly. What a disgrace.

385
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,220
Only these two are left.

386
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,030
Take it.

387
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,400
So she recognized me.

388
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,270
What's all this?

389
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,040
How nauseating.

390
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,330
If she just favors her cousin,

391
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,240
what's the point of us competing at all?

392
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,030
Isn't this just making a fool of us?

393
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,830
Miss Rong, you're showing such favoritism,

394
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,640
treating your cousin better than others.

395
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,160
It'll be hard to convince everyone.

396
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,690
Exactly!

397
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,640
Miss Rong, you're unfair.

398
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,360
Unfair! We won't accept it!

399
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,920
We fight with all our might,

400
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,240
while your Rong family
is making a fool of us.

401
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,110
-Exactly! It's unfair!
-Exactly!

402
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,840
Someone tampered with his tea.

403
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,310
The truth will be revealed
upon examination.

404
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,960
Now,

405
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,420
does anyone still say I'm unfair?

406
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,440
Let's start now.

407
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,490
Don't waste any more time.

408
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,960
The contest continues.

409
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,470
Aren't you going?

410
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,790
I wouldn't dare go first.

411
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,110
After you.

412
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,510
Don't let go!

413
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,560
Mr. Bai. Mr. Bai.

414
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,440
He just passed out like that?

415
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,390
My legs...

416
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,420
Yang Dingchen!

417
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,090
Good! Well done!

418
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,030
Shanbao, look!

419
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,800
If you all help me get the prize,

420
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,400
our He family will reward you handsomely.

421
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,890
Don't let him reap the benefits
from our rivalry.

422
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,330
Who actually won, then?

423
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Well,

424
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,880
who should be the winner?

425
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,590
Miss Rong.

426
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,110
Yes.

427
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,070
The prize has been claimed.

428
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,400
The martial contest ends here.

429
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,510
Young Masters, please await

430
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,240
the next round of competition.

431
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,960
You may go back to rest for now.

432
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,310
[Xinfang Pavilion]

433
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,040
Come in.

434
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,679
Miss Rong ordered me to bring

435
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,449
Mr. Zhao here today
for a follow-up examination.

436
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,170
Please send my thanks to Miss Rong.

437
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,050
I'm fine.

438
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,630
Miss Rong has said

439
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,440
that his old injuries
are not yet resolved,

440
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,909
and today he has got new wounds.

441
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,880
Mr. Zhao, please

442
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,290
conduct a thorough examination today.

443
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,440
If you need any medicinal herbs,

444
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,370
just let me know.

445
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,190
Yes.

446
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,679
I dare not disobey Miss Rong's orders.

447
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,310
Greetings, Mr. Wen.

448
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,510
Please wait a moment.

449
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,070
Take my protective armor

450
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,380
and put it away carefully.

451
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,410
Place it right in the middle

452
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,470
of that cabinet and lock it securely.

453
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,030
Yes.

454
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,630
Shanbao was worried that Yang Dingchen

455
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,320
would hold a grudge and get back at me.

456
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,920
She personally sent this armor
to keep me safe.

457
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,460
Miss Rong was here?

458
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,020
She left only a moment ago.

459
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,350
Shanbao is being overly cautious.

460
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,130
This is the Rong Mansion, after all.

461
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,320
I doubt Yang Dingchen

462
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,110
has the gall to pick a fight here.

463
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,230
If he killed me,

464
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,170
he'd be expelled
from the Rong Mansion for good.

465
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,190
It's securely locked?

466
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,000
You may go now.

467
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,760
Yes.

468
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,110
No wonder someone is trying

469
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,630
to get rid of you at every turn.

470
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,360
It must be because Miss Rong

471
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,080
shows you extraordinary kindness,

472
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,640
far beyond what she extends to others.

473
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,110
We grew up together.

474
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,930
Naturally, our bond
is unlike anyone else's.

475
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,400
Miss Rong,

476
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,760
you're showing too much favoritism.

477
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,820
I invited you here today
to thank you.

478
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,840
Shanbao told me what happened.

479
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,230
I was rude to you at the contest arena.

480
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,630
I hope you can forgive me.

481
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,590
You're too kind, Young Master.

482
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,760
I know my place.

483
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,010
I don't deserve such thanks.

484
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,130
I know Shanbao cares for me deeply.

485
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,810
She seems cold-faced,

486
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
but she's soft-hearted.

487
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,730
It's my own fault
for being incompetent in martial arts

488
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,390
and making her worry about me.

489
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,550
Since Shanbao has put her trust in you,

490
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,590
then I will trust you too.

491
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,140
I hope you can help me.

492
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,760
I will surely repay your kindness
in the future.

493
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,910
I will spare no effort

494
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,640
to live up to Miss Rong's trust.

495
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,480
We all

496
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,290
fought tooth and nail to get here.

497
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,750
What makes him so special?

498
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,810
Let's go check it out.

499
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,670
Everyone, please calm down

500
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,670
and hear me out.

501
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,550
-We won't listen!
-We won't listen!

502
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,150
What's the point of listening?

503
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,510
We all

504
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,710
fought tooth and nail to get here.

505
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,190
This is unfair.

506
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,480
Exactly!

507
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,760
What has he done to deserve it?

508
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,510
How is that even fair?

509
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,590
Since he got here,

510
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,840
he has never shown his face.

511
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,000
If he's not guilty,

512
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,440
why is he hiding?

513
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,510
Ask him to come out!

514
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,030
Let him confront us face to face!

515
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,090
What dirty tricks is he up to in there?

516
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,900
Mr. Bai,

517
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,810
what's happening here?

518
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,540
It's all about Mr. Yan.

519
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,110
He didn't take part
in the martial contest,

520
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,030
and everyone is seething with resentment.

521
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,800
It's completely unfair!

522
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,300
Ask him to come out!

523
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,570
We barely see him around,

524
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,580
yet the Rong family treats him
as an honored guest.

525
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,950
It's truly puzzling.

526
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,890
Yan? His surname is Yan?

527
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,740
Why does

528
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,590
this surname sound so familiar?

529
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,920
We all proved our worth
with our abilities, right?

530
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,280
Exactly!

531
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,030
He didn't even take part
in the martial contest.

532
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,960
There's such a commotion outside,

533
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,390
yet the man inside remains undisturbed.

534
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
How extraordinary.

535
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,840
How is that even fair?

536
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,360
We'll wait right here.

537
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,710
Shut up!

538
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,040
Let's see if he dares...

539
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,840
You useless cowards.

540
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,580
Why not just go in and see for yourselves?

541
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:50,900
You!

542
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,810
Follow him.

543
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,420
Mr. Yang.

544
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,320
Mr. Yang.

545
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,630
Everyone,

546
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,100
my young master has gone to Chongxi Hall.

547
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,330
When he returns,

548
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,510
I will inform him.

549
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,380
Chongxi Hall? Lady Rong?

550
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:14,840
Just who exactly

551
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,000
is this Mr. Yan?

552
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,760
Since Master Chanhui

553
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,200
created the 18 Dragon Movements,

554
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,000
for a hundred years,

555
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,710
they have only been performed

556
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,670
at the Tea Ceremony
at Ganlu Temple on Mount Meng.

557
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,230
I never thought that today

558
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,960
I would witness it personally.

559
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,880
This is all thanks to you.

560
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,170
Lady Rong, you flatter me.

561
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,800
Since childhood, I've made a vow

562
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,090
to serve Tea Master Wu on Mount Meng

563
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,130
and follow his path of helping people,

564
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,740
clearing barren hills,
building tea plantations,

565
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,600
and benefiting the local people.

566
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,390
I learned the 18 Dragon Movements

567
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,620
during my practice

568
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,000
from my fellow disciples at Ganlu Temple.

569
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,070
Monks do not hoard their knowledge.

570
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,510
Lady Rong, if you like them,

571
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,370
you can send people to learn them.

572
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,440
The Ganlu Tea today

573
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,000
has such a translucent hue,

574
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,600
and a richer chestnut aroma.

575
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,040
There is a 300-year-old well

576
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,920
in the backyard
of the temple where I practiced.

577
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,880
It's always covered with

578
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,940
a heavy stone slab.

579
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,730
The slab is covered with moss.

580
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,550
For some unknown reason,

581
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,590
it rains whenever the slab is lifted,

582
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,230
and the rain stops
when the slab is replaced.

583
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,890
This attracts many visitors.

584
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,190
When the tea

585
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,110
is brewed with water from this well,

586
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,570
the tea will be
more fragrant and flavorful.

587
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,190
Bao,

588
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,680
it's a real privilege
that Mr. Yan is willing to teach you.

589
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,430
You must learn attentively.

590
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,240
Yes.

591
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,660
Do you think Mr. Yan resembles him?

592
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,630
Not really.

593
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,330
That's what I think too.

594
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,030
But Mr. Yan is

595
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,560
a well-mannered young man.

596
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,500
It's fine

597
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,670
that they're not alike.

598
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,030
Mr. Yan, you're truly selfless,

599
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,630
sharing all your knowledge.

600
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,920
However, here in Linji,

601
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,050
we lack that well with its sweet water,

602
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,900
so we probably can't make

603
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,760
such uniquely flavored tea.

604
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,870
Why are you laughing, Mr. Yan?

605
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,170
I'm laughing at myself.

606
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,800
I was

607
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,110
supposed to take my vows

608
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,440
and become a monk today.

609
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,800
My father sent men to cut off

610
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,730
all food supplies to the mountain.

611
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,350
If I hadn't come down,

612
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,630
he would have starved

613
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,630
all the monks in the temple to death.

614
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,590
I'm sorry. I had no idea...

615
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,520
I truly believed

616
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,390
my devotion to Buddha was unshakable.

617
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,190
So before coming here, I told myself

618
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,240
that if the Rong family forced me

619
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,600
to marry you against my will,

620
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,070
I would rather die

621
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,690
than ruin years of my practice

622
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,190
and break the vows

623
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,390
I made before Buddha.

624
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,810
But upon seeing you, I finally realized

625
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,230
that I am just

626
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,190
a very ordinary

627
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,400
man in this world,

628
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,030
so I cannot

629
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,960
continue serving Buddha anymore.

630
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,070
What have you done wrong, Mr. Yan?

631
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,030
I see the prayer flags fluttering
in the wind.

632
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,340
But it is not the fault of the wind,

633
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,280
nor is it the fault of the flags.

634
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,030
All the fault

635
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,970
lies within myself.

636
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,350
Mr. Yan

637
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,150
is truly like an unsolvable puzzle.
