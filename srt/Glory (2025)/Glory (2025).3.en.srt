00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,720
[Glory]

2
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,640
You're mean!

4
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,759
-You're so harsh!
-Behave yourself.

5
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,640
Let me go!

6
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,170
Let me go!

7
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,840
Don't move.

8
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,759
You cursed wretch!

9
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,890
How many more in my family
do you want to harm?

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,020
Shanbao.

11
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,410
You're still helping her?

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,350
It's all because of her

13
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,550
that Mother fell ill,

14
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,480
that all the medicines didn't work,

15
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,920
and that she passed away so early.

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
That idiot who never grows up,

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,230
what's the use of keeping her alive?

18
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,150
Wanwan is innocent and pure,

19
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,560
knowing nothing of the world.

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Mother gave her life

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,590
in exchange for hers.

22
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,450
I won't let you harm her in any way.

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,170
Wanwan, don't be afraid.

24
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,890
I'm here.

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,240
Silly Wanwan.

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,440
Don't believe what she says.

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,870
No one in the Rong family hates you

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,930
more than she does.

29
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,190
She wishes you dead even in her dreams.

30
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,190
Once you're dead,

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
the lie becomes the truth.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
Rong Yunyin, how dare you!

33
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,560
What?

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,860
Is she your only blood sister?

35
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,910
Wasn't I born

36
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,310
of the same mother as you?

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,290
We're both your blood sisters,

38
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,230
yet you treat her better than me!

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,030
Guards!

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,790
Miss Rong.

41
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,190
Search!

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

43
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,560
Lock the courtyard gates.

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,020
No one is allowed in or out.

45
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,530
You, go search over there.

46
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,150
Stop hitting me. Stop.

47
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,079
Stop hitting me.

48
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,400
Please spare me, Young Master.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,000
I won't dare do it again.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,730
Who's there?

51
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,560
Have you lost your mind
in front of Miss Rong?

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,160
What are you babbling about?

53
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,870
Miss Rong.

54
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,780
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,710
I...

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,650
During the day, I dropped

57
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,530
a wooden bucket in the garden.

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,410
Afraid of being beaten
by the steward tomorrow,

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,560
I wanted to sneak back and retrieve it

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
while the household
was busy with the banquet.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,870
But I ran into Mr. Wang,

62
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,730
who beat me without a word.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
When I heard all the noise just now,

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,160
I thought he had returned.

65
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,280
And I just panicked.

66
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,280
What an insolent thief!

67
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,050
How audacious you are,

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,000
to be caught red‑handed
and still dare to lie.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,530
Take him away immediately.

70
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,420
No need to trouble the officials.

71
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,159
Give him thirty strokes first.

72
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,810
I would never dare to lie.

73
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,550
Never!

74
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:44,650
Right.

75
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,830
This jade pendant,

76
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,830
I tore it from him

77
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,159
in my panic.

78
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,110
Miss Rong.

79
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,870
I've checked, and all the guards

80
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,950
were at their posts.

81
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,070
Among those not on duty,

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,360
only this stable boy

83
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,910
stayed alone in the shed.

84
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,720
The rest

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,120
can vouch for each other.

86
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,960
They never went to Qilan Garden.

87
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,710
As for Xinfang Pavilion,

88
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,360
during the gathering, Mr. Song, Mr. Lin,

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,270
and Mr. Wang all left their seats
at different times,

90
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,270
and their whereabouts are unknown.

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,530
Miss Rong, he truly didn't lie.

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,460
This wooden bucket

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,120
was indeed left in the garden.

94
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,600
It seems someone named Wang
was causing trouble.

95
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,850
What's his name?

96
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,920
Miss Rong.

97
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,960
His name is

98
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,600
Wang...

99
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,830
Wang Lu.

100
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,960
That's right.

101
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,250
His name is Wang Lu.

102
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,600
Wang Lu?

103
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,870
Fire! Fire!

104
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,190
Help! It's on fire!

105
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,190
It's coming from Xinfang Pavilion.

106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,830
Miss Rong, what else should I do?

107
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,390
Lift your head.

108
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,880
It's such a lively scene.

109
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,110
You should come along too.

110
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
Miss Rong, it's my fault

111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
for being negligent with Mr. Wen.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,730
Thankfully,

113
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,430
he wasn't hurt badly.

114
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,890
Miss...

115
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,700
Bao.

116
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,800
Bao.

117
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,190
You...

118
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
You'd better escort Mr. Wen

119
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
back to his room to rest.

120
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,830
Yes.

121
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,160
Only flawless jade
is worthy of being paired.

122
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,330
He is that useless.

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,750
Even ten guards

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,630
would fail to keep his virtue intact.

125
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,830
Who set the fire?

126
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,159
I saw Mr. Wen

127
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,950
was drunk

128
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,830
and feared he might fall,

129
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,290
so I quietly followed him.

130
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,390
Then I saw someone sneaking

131
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,040
into his room under cover of night.

132
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,830
I couldn't make a fuss
but couldn't do nothing either,

133
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,630
so I used smoke to drive them off.

134
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,800
I acted out of urgency
and couldn't inform anyone beforehand.

135
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,460
Please forgive me, Miss Rong.

136
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,950
Fire! Fire!

137
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,560
Fire!

138
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,200
Fire!

139
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,330
Miss Rong.

140
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,570
The guests have all been settled.

141
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,720
Luckily, nothing serious happened.

142
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,310
Just

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,260
one of Young Master's
brocade robes got burned.

144
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,290
You silly fool.

145
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,750
There are plenty of silk
and cloth in the guest rooms.

146
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,350
Just burn whatever you like.

147
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,330
Why would you burn your own clothes?

148
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,059
You're not so clever yourself.

149
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,360
Perhaps that's exactly

150
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,600
what he wanted you to ask.

151
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,780
None of those things belong to me.

152
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,600
Wen Can is tall

153
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,100
and completely drunk.

154
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,160
A frail woman would
have trouble handling him.

155
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,620
Didn't you see anyone else

156
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,060
when you came?

157
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,820
Forgive me for arriving late.

158
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,240
I didn't see anyone else.

159
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Thanks for your help, Young Master.

160
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,120
Steward Cheng.

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,650
Escort him back to his room.

162
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,010
Yes.

163
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,610
Mr. Bai, this way please.

164
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,390
Miss Rong.

165
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,840
After the fire,

166
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,000
everyone was either in their rooms

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
or in the Flower Hall.

168
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,030
Only Song Yifang,

169
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,600
Lin Shishuo, and Wang Lu

170
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,400
arrived late.

171
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,320
That Wang Lu in particular

172
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,450
was hesitant and unclear in his words.

173
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,240
So they actually went wandering
in the garden at night.

174
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,180
Since we don't know which one it was,

175
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,580
detain all three of them.

176
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,780
Yunyin, watch your words.

177
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,000
Miss Rong.

178
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,730
I have something important to report.

179
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,960
Don't stop me!

180
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,150
Give me two more drinks.

181
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,390
Tell Mr. Bai that

182
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,630
I can drink more.

183
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,570
Alright, alright.

184
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,400
Don't help me.

185
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:15,790
Wine.

186
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,670
-Young Master. -Let me drink.

187
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,630
I'm here with Young Master.

188
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,430
You may leave.

189
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,960
-Yes. -One more drink.

190
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,070
Young Master.

191
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,000
How many went tonight?

192
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,670
Fifteen.

193
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,510
Still too slow.

194
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,280
More drinks.

195
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,630
Bring me good wine.

196
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,790
-The best one.
-Okay, okay.

197
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,600
More drinks.

198
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,120
Please forgive me, Miss Rong.

199
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,670
I'm the one who accidentally entered

200
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,930
Qilan Garden tonight.

201
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,120
Didn't you already cover it up?

202
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,280
Miss Rong, you're sharp‑eyed.

203
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,730
I might fool others,

204
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,900
but I could never fool you.

205
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,630
What are you trying to do,

206
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
sneaking into Qilan Garden at night

207
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,210
to eavesdrop on me and my sister?

208
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,720
After falling from the cliff,

209
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,720
I should have been dead.

210
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,960
It was only by your kindness
that I was taken in,

211
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,630
treated, and kept alive.

212
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,280
I came to Qilan Garden

213
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,790
because there is a matter
of great importance.

214
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,550
Go ahead.

215
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,320
Please wait a moment, Miss.

216
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,710
Indenture?

217
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,330
I trespassed into Qilan Garden
late at night

218
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,210
only because our difference in status

219
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,840
forbade me from
speaking with you privately.

220
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,200
Miss Rong, your grace in saving my life

221
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,260
is beyond measure.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,440
How could it ever be repaid

223
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
by merely tending a few horses

224
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,680
or doing menial work?

225
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,150
Miss Rong, if you don't despise me,

226
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,870
I'm willing to be your servant,

227
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,000
and do whatever you command,
serving you for all my days.

228
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,030
From now on, if you bid me live,

229
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,400
I shall live.

230
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,670
If you bid me die,

231
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,150
I shall die.

232
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,450
In life and in death,

233
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,870
I belong to you alone.

234
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,980
Should I ever betray this vow,
may Heaven itself deny me mercy.

235
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,810
You want to be a servant
of the Rong family?

236
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,260
Not the Rong family's.

237
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Yours.

238
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
Listen and tell me

239
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,020
whether I am right.

240
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,070
Covered in injuries,

241
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,360
you feared you had made
some enemies outside,

242
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,630
so you dare not leave
the Rong family lightly.

243
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,890
You came to me secretly

244
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,800
because you want
to discover your identity.

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
After overhearing a few words
between Yunyin and me,

246
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,510
you feared that Yunyin might harm you.

247
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,440
So you intend to use this indenture

248
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,510
to secure a way out through me.

249
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,560
Am I right?

250
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
I beg you to see the sincerity

251
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,980
of my heart, Miss Rong.

252
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,840
You're clearly desperate to survive,

253
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,040
with no other choice.

254
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,840
Yet you present yourself
with such honesty and sincerity,

255
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,350
with a clear sense of gratitude and duty.

256
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,740
Having someone of your talent
serving in the Rong family

257
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,940
is quite a gain for me.

258
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,870
Well. Go to Xinfang Pavilion

259
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,200
and take good care of Wen Can.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,330
Miss Rong, your request

261
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,270
is not something I should refuse.

262
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,320
But I'm just a lowly person.

263
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,750
I still live in that shack

264
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,870
and need to tend the horses.

265
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,950
It's hard for me to fulfill both duties.

266
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,750
He's trying all sorts of ways

267
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,150
to get better treatment.

268
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,150
Besides,

269
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,080
Xinfang Pavilion
is full of important guests,

270
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,940
none of whom are easy to deal with.

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,400
With my unknown background and low status,

272
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,590
I fear I cannot handle it,

273
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,640
thus failing your trust.

274
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,230
You saw it yourself tonight.

275
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,480
There is constant danger

276
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,680
surrounding Wen Can.

277
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,720
I can't always be by his side.

278
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,740
So I need someone sharp-eyed
and clear-minded

279
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,070
to keep him out of danger

280
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,970
and turn bad luck into good.

281
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,010
After it's done,

282
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,910
I'll have someone
investigate your identity

283
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,480
and send you where you belong.

284
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,480
Do you truly mean it, Miss Rong?

285
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,270
Let's seal our agreement with a handshake.

286
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,660
♪ Who tore a strand of light
from the night ♪

287
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,620
Since you belong to me now,

288
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,750
♪ Hearing the lament of fading beauty ♪

289
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,480
I should give you a name myself.

290
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,070
From today on,

291
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,120
you shall be called Fusheng.

292
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,240
♪ Worldly passions drift away,
turning into twilight ♪

293
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,570
I, Fusheng, thank you, Miss,
for the name.

294
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,910
♪ Grass grows, orioles fly,

295
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,480
But

296
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,380
I should have a surname, shouldn't I?

297
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,980
Let it be Lu.

298
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,350
♪ Love returns in scattered fragments,
yet longing remains ♪

299
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,810
I, Lu Fusheng, thank you,
Miss, for the name.

300
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,030
You may leave now.

305

Who's lurking there?

306
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,240
Come out!

307
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,240
It's Mr. Song.

308
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,100
Search him.

309
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,550
Yes.

310
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,270
Gilded entwined-branch candlestick
from the Flower Hall.

311
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,350
What a well-bred gentleman you are.

312
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,350
By law,

313
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,590
the thief shall be beaten
eighty times with a rod.

314
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,030
Yes.

315
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,960
Please have mercy, Ms. Yan.

316
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,020
Please have mercy.

317
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,170
Though my family has a noble title,

318
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,480
we are in ruin.

319
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,110
I am…

320
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,960
I am utterly desperate.

321
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,020
That's why I did it.

322
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,090
Please show leniency, Ms. Yan.

323
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,150
With conduct like this,

324
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,280
you've truly sullied your good looks.

325
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,010
Ms. Yan, if you like it,

326
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,300
I can have this candlestick

327
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,740
sent to your room.

328
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,070
If you like it,

329
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,480
I can leave

330
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,810
this candlestick here.

331
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,000
Mr. Song, if you want to learn

332
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,510
how to stand on your own,

333
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,920
I

334
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,240
can teach you some
of the rules in the Rong family,

335
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,840
so you can support yourself.

336
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,370
It is far better than
starving in a fallen family.

337
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,510
As for the noble Miss Rong,

338
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,440
she's out of your reach.

339
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,970
Let go of your hopes from now on.

340
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,980
Your tea-making

341
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,010
has always been flawless.

342
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,610
Yet the matter of your marriage

343
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,310
is always on my mind.

344
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,070
Fifteen people went there yesterday.

345
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,960
Do any of the remaining ones
catch your eye?

346
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,400
No.

347
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,200
If none are to your liking,

348
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,310
dismiss them and continue the search.

349
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,110
Grandmother.

350
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,440
The men who came this time

351
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,680
are all talented from various regions.

352
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,010
There's no need to rush.

353
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,710
From what I can see,

354
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Shanbao still wishes to test

355
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,860
their character further.

356
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,340
As long as you know what to do,
that's enough.

357
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,510
Has anyone from the Yan family arrived?

358
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,960
The age card was sent earlier,

359
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,220
and they are probably still on their way.

360
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,000
Ganlu Temple on Mount Meng

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,310
isn't far from here.

362
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,090
Why are they taking so long?

363
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,260
Lady Rong, shall we send someone?

364
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,480
Forget it.

365
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,240
Judging by Bao's attitude,

366
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,300
she won't make a choice anytime soon.

367
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,490
So there's no need to hurry.

368
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,830
Lady Rong.

369
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,160
Yesterday, one of the rejected suitors,

370
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,000
Song Yifang,

371
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,630
coming from a poor family,

372
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,760
is willing to serve in the Rong family.

373
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,510
I find him clever

374
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,320
and somewhat educated.

375
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
Would you consider keeping him?

376
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,270
You can handle
such matters as you see fit.

377
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,440
Yes.

378
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,550
Jingyi.

379
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,140
You look

380
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,070
radiant today.

381
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,750
Being able to serve
by your side, Lady Rong,

382
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,160
is a blessing for me.

383
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,270
Grandmother still loves you the most,

384
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,960
and truly wants you

385
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,360
to find someone perfect.

386
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,350
You know,

387
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,940
Grandmother gave me the right to choose,

388
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,750
but she didn't give me

389
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,410
the right not to choose at all.

390
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,040
[Qilan Garden]

391
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,240
Bao.

392
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,330
Call me Shanbao.

393
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,110
Shanbao.

394
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,400
They all forced me to drink last night.

395
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,660
They know you favor me,

396
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,400
so they all want to harm me.

397
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,750
Those men are all petty,

398
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,640
full of schemes,

399
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,300
and definitely not your match.

400
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,980
Could you send them all away?

401
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,100
No.

402
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,270
If they don't leave,

403
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,160
they'll surely gang up

404
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,930
to bully me.

405
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,200
Shanbao.

406
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,030
How can you be so stone-hearted,

407
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,940
so icy,

408
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
and so cruel?

409
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,780
Don't you care about me even a little?

410
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,940
If you can't handle it, you can leave.

411
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,720
Shanbao.

412
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,270
This person beside you

413
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,270
is quite capable.

414
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,850
Feel free to use him.

415
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,910
Why did Shanbao just praise you?

416
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,720
Miss Rong means that

417
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,480
if there's any danger,

418
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,140
you can push me forward
to shield you at any time.

419
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,590
Yesterday's banquet was a trap.

420
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,750
Miss Rong has yet to make an appearance.

421
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,600
What? Another trap today?

422
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,130
Mr. He, you're being too harsh.

423
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,440
Miss Rong once said that

424
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
integrity is a gentleman's virtue.

425
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,790
All the gentlemen

426
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,680
standing in this hall today

427
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,920
are men of impeccable character

428
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,980
and noble conduct.

429
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,000
If that's the case,

430
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,790
why hasn't Miss Rong shown herself yet?

431
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,400
Don't tell me she intends
to have a servant

432
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,630
evaluate those suitors on her behalf?

433
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,590
Marriage depends on character

434
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,680
as well as fate.

435
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,200
Miss Rong intends

436
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,460
to invite one gentleman to dine with her.

437
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,790
That's why she sent me here today.

438
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,240
Invite whom?

439
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,040
Me, of course.

440
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,720
All gentlemen,

441
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,030
please have a gift ready.

442
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,790
Whoever's gift

443
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,190
catches Miss Rong's eye,

444
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,510
she will host a banquet at Qilan Garden.

445
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,960
You have three days.

446
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,750
Mr. Wen, you and Miss Rong

447
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,750
grew up together.

448
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,920
Do you know what

449
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,830
Miss Rong likes?

450
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,030
Right, tell us!

451
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,720
Tell us.

452
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,270
Tell us.

453
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,470
Shanbao likes sweets.

454
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,240
The sweeter, the better.

455
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,270
Sweets?

456
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,200
-The sweeter, the better.
-I'll buy it now.

457
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
The sweeter, the better.

458
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,550
The sweeter, the better.

459
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,440
The sweeter, the better.

460
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,590
The sweeter, the better.

461
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,920
Mr. Wen, tell us more.

462
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,380
What else? Please tell us.

463
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,730
What else does she like?

464
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
Can we trust what he says?

465
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,590
Yes.

466
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,110
Seems we can't.

467
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,730
You're quite clever.

468
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,760
Yesterday's alliance is over.

469
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,470
Now that we're on our own.

470
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,400
You...

471
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,930
You're bound to lose.

472
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
You poor scholar.

473
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,680
Our Rong family has everything.

474
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,440
Yet she

475
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,760
comes right away asking for gifts.

476
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,350
People who don't know better

477
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,240
might think our Rong family

478
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,700
is full of shallow people.

479
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,880
When you're eating at my place,

480
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,970
don't talk about such unpleasant things,

481
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,500
or you'll get indigestion.

482
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,310
Yunxi.

483
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,790
Have you read those age cards

484
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,900
I gave you last time?

485
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,680
Even if you marry

486
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,040
later than Rong Shanbao,

487
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,880
you can't fall behind her

488
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,680
when it comes to bearing an heir.

489
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
All I care about is cultivating tea.

490
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,260
I don't really care about these matters.

491
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,350
Indeed.

492
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,890
Those men all seem quite ordinary.

493
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,640
But there is a silly one.

494
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,610
Mr. Bai, you...

495
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,740
Don't disturb others.

496
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,470
He really is a silly one.

497
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,920
I know my sister's preferences

498
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,070
very well.

499
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,310
But in this world,

500
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,640
nothing comes for free.

501
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,590
Mr. Rong, just tell us,

502
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,920
what we can do for you.

503
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,010
Basic information costs one tael of gold.

504
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Decent information, ten taels.

505
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,650
As for top-grade information,

506
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,400
fifty taels.

507
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,830
Cash on delivery, fair and square.

508
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,630
Young Master.

509
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,000
Miss Rong requests that you

510
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,270
continue kneeling
outside the ancestral hall.

511
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,030
Why?

512
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,420
Miss Rong said that

513
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,490
if you can sell out

514
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,370
her preferences for money today,

515
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,160
tomorrow

516
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,310
you could sell out
the Rong family for money.

517
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,200
That's why you must be punished.

518
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,920
Nonsense!

519
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,590
Am I the kind of person

520
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,110
who can't tell right from wrong?

521
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,680
Besides,

522
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,040
I haven't even taken the money yet!

523
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,540
You... what are you doing? What?

524
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,550
I... let me go! Let me go!

525
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,790
Let go of me!

526
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,700
-What are you doing?
-Gentlemen.

527
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,160
I...

528
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,350
Don't waste your time

529
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,270
trying to know Miss Rong's tastes.

530
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,030
You'd be better off using that time

531
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,030
to prepare a proper gift.

532
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Yes.

533
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,920
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

534
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,360
What happened, Mr. Wen?

535
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,510
They're all wrong.

536
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,750
What?

537
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Shanbao doesn't like anything.

538
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,050
Ever since she was little,

539
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,270
she's been like a bodhisattva in a temple,

540
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,000
showing no preferences at all.

541
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,350
Shanbao only needs to choose me,

542
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,790
yet suddenly there are

543
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,320
so many meddlesome people.

544
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,350
Why do they think

545
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,750
they can dine in her room?

546
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,540
Mr. Wen, don't worry too much.

547
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,590
You and Miss Rong grew up together.

548
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,720
No one else can match

549
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,190
that kind of connection.

550
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,030
No wonder Shanbao said that

551
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,230
you're a capable man.

552
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,240
You have reminded me.

553
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,920
Miss Rong, something's happened
at the tea shop.

554
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,670
[Second-grade goods of the Rong Family]

555
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,270
Everyone.

556
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,580
[Rong's Tea House]

557
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,790
I paid 3,000 taels of silver

558
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,790
for premium Mingqian Longjing Tea.

559
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,690
But when it arrived in Guangzhou,

560
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,110
I found it mixed with

561
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,270
dyed inferior tea!

562
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,680
That's impossible.

563
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,310
Look, everyone.

564
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,550
The tea's all cloudy.

565
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,830
The Rong's Tea House is full of swindlers!

566
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,640
Swindlers?

567
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,510
That can't be right.

568
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,160
Make way.

569
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,610
Make way!

570
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,880
Miss Rong is here.

571
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Miss Rong is here.

572
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,590
Miss Rong.

573
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,240
Miss Rong.

574
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,500
Where's the goods?

575
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,350
I haven't even touched the seals yet.

576
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,030
Miss Rong,

577
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,540
you have to take responsibility.

578
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,490
Scissors.

579
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,810
What does this mean?

580
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,910
It looks like...

581
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,270
Mr. Liu.

582
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,920
Miss Rong.

583
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,550
I bought a new batch of tea

584
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,070
that hasn't been shipped yet.

585
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,790
Bring it here.

586
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,340
Yes.

587
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,720
Look.

588
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,490
Let's wait.

589
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,960
How did this character appear?

590
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,720
It's a mark.

591
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,580
There is a character underneath.

592
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,350
The Rong family has always done business

593
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,920
honestly and fairly.

594
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,310
Mr. Wang.

595
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,280
What else do you have to say?

596
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,960
You can't leave! You can't leave!

597
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,550
Move aside!

598
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,510
You can't leave!

599
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,530
What kind of tea is this?

600
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,050
I'll beat you to death!

601
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,110
How dare you slander Miss Rong!

602
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,310
You must give Miss Rong an explanation!

603
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,310
She didn't even say much,

604
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,110
and it was all settled.

605
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,070
The Rong family's centuries-old reputation

606
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,530
truly lives up to its name.

607
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,000
Miss Rong

608
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,350
really stands out.

609
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,520
The Rong family has gone too far.

610
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,270
You know what to do.

611
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,110
Yes.

612
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:33,840
Miss Rong!

613
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,190
Miss Rong!

614
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,280
Miss Rong.

615
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,469
Mr. Wen has been struck with severe pain,

616
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,310
sweating through three layers of clothes.

617
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,590
Yet he refuses to call for a physician

618
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,050
and insists on seeing you.

619
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,980
Please, Miss Rong,

620
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,260
go check on him now.

621
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,760
Shanbao.

622
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,890
After much thought,

623
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,340
I still don't know

624
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,400
what gift I should

625
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,930
give you.

626
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,260
In the past, we grew up together

627
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,790
with deep affection.

628
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,600
Shanbao.

629
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,880
You're my older cousin,

630
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,710
but please don't always see me
as just a little brother.

631
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,670
Time has passed,

632
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,940
and I've grown into a man now.

633
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,660
I'm willing to conquer the world for you,

634
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,400
and protect you

635
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,410
for all eternity.

636
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,650
What are you doing?

637
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,710
Let me out!

638
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,800
Shanbao, let me out!

639
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,480
Shanbao, let me out!

640
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,400
Let me out!

641
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,500
Miss Rong said that

642
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,280
you can only come out

643
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
when you have recovered from your madness.

644
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,920
Shanbao!

645
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,090
Shanbao, let me out!

646
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm not being ridiculous.

647
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,460
I'm serious.

648
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,840
Miss Rong.

649
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,320
The Young Master's gift

650
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,240
has been prepared.

651
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,300
Please have a look.

652
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,560
Miss Rong.

653
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,430
Tonight is truly lively.

654
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,030
Do you like it?

655
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,250
Miss Rong, please stay.

656
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,690
Just look.

657
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,880
Men in this world are often unfaithful,

658
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,440
only gold is steadfast.

659
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,740
If I ever betray you in the future,

660
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,000
I will voluntarily leave
this household empty-handed,

661
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,790
leaving this mountain of gold for you

662
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,140
to use for daily needs.

663
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,230
Those suitors outside

664
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,090
only covet your vast tea plantations.

665
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,580
They make empty promises, hoping
to gain much by investing little.

666
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,310
Only I

667
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,590
dare to transform half my business empire

668
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,920
into a mountain of gold,

669
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,390
as a gift of my heart,

670
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,230
just to earn a place by your side.

671
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,220
Put your clothes on.

672
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
You don't like it?

673
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,690
I'd rather have

674
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,440
the freshly picked

675
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,300
imperial green buds from Xishan.

676
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,860
[Rong Mansion]

677
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,880
What's going on with this weather?

678
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,840
Why is it so hot?

679
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,480
Mr. Wen, where's your gift?

680
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,190
Mind your own business.

681
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,090
They are all mundane things.

682
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,900
My gift

683
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,290
has already been given to Shanbao.

684
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,290
What have you prepared?

685
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Let me show you.

686
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,840
Don't tell anyone else.

687
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,190
Miss Rong has arrived!

688
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,850
She's here.

689
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,120
Who's first?

690
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,150
I'll go first.

691
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,950
I'll go first.

692
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:29,920
Miss Rong.

693
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,630
This is my family's heirloom
gold ornament.

694
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,070
It has now been passed down

695
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,320
to the fifth generation with me.

696
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
What do you think?

697
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,830
Send him away.

698
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,510
Why?

699
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,000
Even if you don't like it,

700
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,280
you can't just send people away.

701
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,340
This headdress comes from Ruifuxuan

702
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,290
and is worth 1,200 taels of silver.

703
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,320
Am I right?

704
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,380
Guards.

705
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:51,970
Send him away.

706
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,630
Merchants value honesty above all.

707
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,800
You may choose not to give anything,

708
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,460
but you must not be deceitful.

709
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,970
Our Rong family does not
tolerate unscrupulous people.

710
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,120
These hairpins and jade ornaments
are common items.

711
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,890
Miss Rong, please take a look

712
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,440
at my tea set.

713
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,760
This set consists of
black-gold glazed cups

714
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,070
from the imperial court
of the early Song dynasty.

715
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,000
It's priceless in today's market.

716
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,550
I have painstakingly

717
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,310
sought it out for you.

718
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,370
This time,

719
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,790
you'll definitely like my gift, right?

720
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,110
Indeed, it's nice.

721
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,020
You may go.

722
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,510
Miss Rong, look at this whip.

723
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,810
How is it?

724
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,920
Not bad.

725
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,070
Young Master, please.

726
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,110
Miss Rong, please look at mine.

727
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,060
Young Master, you may leave.

728
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:17,960
What's this?

729
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,100
This is a copy of The Classic of Tea

730
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,580
that I personally transcribed and bound.

731
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,220
Your handwriting is good.

732
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,710
I... I used to

733
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,840
often help the headmaster copy books.

734
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,480
I've seen all your gifts.

735
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,800
Please take them back with you.

736
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,280
What?

737
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,360
Miss Rong, are these gifts
not to your liking?

738
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,180
When I asked you to prepare gifts,

739
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,040
I wasn't after your possessions.

740
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,350
Gifts carry no measure of worth.

741
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,710
They are entirely
a reflection of your hearts.

742
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,240
The gifts you've presented

743
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,540
reflect

744
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,460
how much you value me.

745
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,320
Now I know completely.

746
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,240
So there is no need to accept the gifts.

747
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,440
Our Rong family won't

748
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,240
let your efforts go unrewarded.

749
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,590
This afternoon, I'll have someone deliver

750
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,420
return gifts of equal value.

751
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
Then who will you dine with tonight?

752
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,080
Before dinner, I'll have the steward

753
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,430
personally extend the invitation.

754
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,030
You, come with me.

755
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,260
Yes.

[The Classic of Tea]

757
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,340
This is a copy of The Classic of Tea

758
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,730
that I personally transcribed and bound.

759
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,920
The Classic of Tea is the earliest,

760
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,670
most complete, and most comprehensive

761
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,630
monograph on tea in China

762
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,480
and indeed the world.

763
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,280
It consists of
three volumes and ten chapters,

764
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,880
earning the reputation
of an encyclopedia of tea.

765
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,030
From cultivation methods
and the selection of utensils

766
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:00,710
to the techniques of brewing tea,
all are meticulously recorded,

767
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,000
making it

768
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,590
an ancient guide for tea.

769
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,840
The author, Lu Yu,

770
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,150
even carefully designed a set of

771
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,550
specialized tea wares

772
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,920
for brewing and drinking tea.

773
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,280
The Classic of Tea is

774
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,510
an important document for studying

775
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:12,670
ancient Chinese tea culture.

776
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,800
It has promoted the popularity
of tea ceremonies,

777
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,440
and is one of the world's
three greatest tea classics.
